            "article_content": "From breaking news, like the Supreme Court ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, to lighter stories, like the time a young traveler bumped into David Bowie, the CNN visuals team helps to tell these stories through maps, charts, illustrations and interactives. The staff of designers, data editors, developers and more highlighted their favorite visuals of 2022. On June 24, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion, effectively turning abortion access back to the states. The ruling overturns 1973\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion across the country. I found the visualizations by Daniel Wolfe, Tal Yellin and Priya Krishnakumar to be particularly striking because they manage to tell the story on a micro and macro level. I was drawn into the impact that the law change has on a single individual in southern Louisiana, while absorbing the wider analysis on the differences between rural and urban states in the US. \u2014 Henrik Pettersson, Senior Visual Editor The CNN Travel story, \u201cWhat happened when a young traveler bumped into David Bowie,\u201d was one of my favorite assignments because this was a unique type of request. There weren\u2019t any photos of the actual event described in the story; all we had was Brad Miele\u2019s description of the encounter with Bowie and the music video where it all took place. I got to play with illustration and motion \u2014 and got to draw David Bowie (obviously, a huge plus). \u2014 Alberto Mier, Senior Designer Nationwide protests that spread across China in November over its zero-Covid policy were historic. Their geographic scope and the sheer number of protesters involved in a country where protests are incredibly rare is a powerful story to chronicle and one that is best told visually. My colleagues did such tremendous work in helping readers understand the frustrations at a human level, and their use of animation really helps walk you through how the unrest there unfolded. I especially love the two triptychs, one a three-panel set of videos of protests in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai to help readers witness footage in multiple places at once. The second triptych breaks down the progression geographically in maps: From Urumqi in northwest China, where lockdown measures hindered rescue efforts after a fatal fire, raising public fury and inspiring protests in at least CNN-confirmed 15 cities nationwide and then spreading to at least 19 cities by the end of the week. They also include a map with estimates on the number of participants in each city, marking those led by student protesters on university campuses. \u2014 Janie Boschma, Senior Editor The feature, \u201cIs the ivory-billed woodpecker extinct?\u201d is the work I feel the strongest about from the past year. It\u2019s not just the art throughout the story, but the way the many arms of the visuals and national team worked together, that made it particularly fulfilling. I can\u2019t wait to work with that gang again. \u2014 Ian Berry, Senior Designer, illustration and animation I remember reading this interactive feature, \u201cAnatomy of the Mariupol hospital attack,\u201d in March and needing to take a moment to process what I had just seen. Videos from the civilian perspective strung together with a 3D rendering of the area helped me understand what an average person in the vicinity of the strike might have been experiencing, even from my home half a world away. The civilian accounts were collected, organized and presented efficiently and effectively through focused collaboration. This kind of story can be difficult to engage with, but the subject is one that needs to be seen. Thanks to my colleagues for their care and hard work on this piece. \u2014 Will Mullery, Designer This piece about mercury being found in skin whitening products, including the health risks at home and affecting family, is incredibly important and was produced in such an effective way. The topic of skin whitening is sensitive and taboo, as it\u2019s hardly discussed in the public. There is a strong fear of judgment relating to this subject and, at the same time, there isn\u2019t much information regarding the dangers of these often under-the-counter ingredients. The style and design of the piece are quite powerful because they\u2019re so inclusive and don\u2019t target a specific culture. \u2014 Elisa Solinas, Art Director, New York, NY The nomination of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court in February highlighted the historic lack of diversity on the nation\u2019s highest court and the absence of Black judges in the federal courts generally. Priya Krishnakumar, then a CNN data and graphics editor, used data from the Federal Judicial Center to create this striking \u201cwaffle\u201d chart to explain how black women have been underrepresented on the bench. The way the visualization is structured, with purple squares representing black judges, leaves no doubt about the historical disparity. \u2014 Matt Stiles, Senior Editor This story on the community fridge movement was an especially gratifying experience, as it was the first story I pitched for CNN. During the pandemic, community fridges and mutual aid projects grew nationwide. The opportunity to raise awareness for these types of organizations and explain both through words and visuals how people can get involved was exciting since I had previously volunteered in my local area and created a mural for a Free99Fridge in Atlanta. I enjoyed creating the designs and map for this piece as well. Both were playful and informative. \u2014 Leah Abucayan, Designer This interactive, \u201cFrom yachts to lavish estates, tracking Russian assets seized so far,\u201d was a favorite from the year because I got to report on, design and code a piece on complex financial ownership structures spanning from superyachts to luxury estates around the world in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u2014 Tal Yellin, Art Director This interactive feature on the portraits of Queen Elizabeth offers a very clean layout using different kinds of animation techniques, including 3D libraries, for the coin reflections and textures. We used unusual components to enhance the experience, including the embedded Spotify song \u201cGod save the queen,\u201d along with style animations to show the bills and stamps. All the elements were developed to be synchronized with the scroll, allowing that to be the center of the experience. \u2014 Marco Chac\u00f3n, Developer Every 10 years, the Census does a new US population count, and most of the 435 US congressional districts are redrawn to reflect those new counts. Redistricting can have a considerable impact on the voting power of political parties and racial/ethnic groups, so we wanted to analyze these changes, which will be in place for the next decade.  Since Census data and election data aren\u2019t immediately available for these new districts, we, over the course of several months, calculated 2020 election data and demographics for the new districts to measure the impacts of these changes. Readers can look at the shifts in voting power for the nation as a whole and by individual state. This was a great collaboration between the Data and Graphics team and the political unit, and was, by far, my favorite project of the year. \u2014 Ren\u00e9e Rigdon, Visual Editor, Cartographer I especially liked the visual approach to this interactive. Because we had to tackle a sensitive subject, it was a sensible visual solution to refer to an Iranian illustrator to treat people\u2019s portraits. \u2014 Rachel Jung, Associate Designer This British royal family tree interactive was designed by our colleagues Ellie Stubbs and Rachel Jung. They took the basic content from an existing CNN story and developed it into a multi-strand interactive finding engaging ways to deal with the huge amount of information and most importantly bringing delight to the reader experience. I particularly like the timeline section where people\u2019s photographs age as you scroll through the decades. There are even some Easter eggs built in \u2014 like if it\u2019s someone\u2019s birthday, confetti falls on the page. \u2014 Sarah-Grace Mankarious, Supervising Editor, Special Projects I just assumed sea level rise was a straightforward subject. Our colleagues, Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 and Temujin Doran, produced original reporting, photography and video explaining that glacier melt can impact those nearest and furthest away in entirely different ways. The CNN Visuals team worked across timezones and departments to help explain these concepts clearly to our readers using animation, data and imagery. I was particularly pleased with the way the team worked together and how our new designer, Rachel Jung, stepped up and designed a layout to tie the whole piece together. \u2014 Byron Manley, Developer In another entry about birds, this is a beautiful interactive exploring habitat loss along one of the largest and most-threatened bird migratory corridors \u2014 the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. Produced by my colleagues from several CNN departments, this piece takes you on a journey along the flyway, from Alaska to New Zealand to South-East Asia. It is immersive, emotional and clearly produced through a smart combination of sound, multimedia, data visualization and text. The story acts as a call to action for people around the world who care about the biodiversity of our planet. \u2014 Krystina Shveda, Data Editor I am constantly in awe of the unique visual storytelling that comes out of collaborative projects, such as this investigation into the Belarus hospitals that concealed Russian casualties. I love the way powerful reporting is combined with visual elements and beautiful illustrations to shed light and provide factual evidence on a very complex and sensitive topic, while at the same time conveying the strong human impact of these stories. \u2014 Carlotta Dotto, Senior Editor The interactive, \u201cThe things Covid victims left behind,\u201d was published close to the date the United States reached 1 million deaths from Covid-19. I love it because the CNN audience sent the objects that remind them of their relatives who died from Covid. This somewhat simple presentation reminds us that it is not necessary to make great developments to achieve such an important and emotional piece. It is impossible not to empathize with the pain these people are feeling and their mourning. \u2014 Jhasua Razo, CNNE Visual Editor",

            "article_content": "Officials in Providence, Rhode Island, recently approved a $10 million budget plan for the city\u2019s reparations program, but some are wondering who might end up benefiting from it. Like other communities across the country did in the wake of the 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Providence sought to start a program offering reparations to Black, Indigenous and other people of color whose families have felt the effects of decades of discriminatory practices. As the city\u2019s plan is underway, critics say the program is being rushed and its guidelines show White residents could qualify based on their income. \u201cIf we are truly looking for a reparative process (and) something to heal the harms of the past, why are we rushing Black folks to work for money they might not even know about?\u201d Justice Gaines, a local community activist, told CNN. Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza approved the $10 million budget plan in early November, prompting the launch of the program days later. It was the result of more than two years of work by city leaders, activists and scholars, the city said. Some of those efforts included the creation of a commission to study the issue of racial inequity and reparations, the publication of a 194-page report detailing how people of color have been harmed by the city and their institutions for more than four centuries and a report outlining 11 major areas the city could address to level the playing field between White people and residents of color in Providence. \u201cThese funds move us one step further towards closing the present-day racial wealth and equity gap,\u201d Elorza wrote in a Facebook post announcing the signing of the budget last month. The program does not include direct cash payments to descendants of enslaved people, a practice which has been discussed by reparations commissions across the United States. Instead, the city\u2019s plan is to fund an array of initiatives aimed at closing the racial wealth and equity gap. Initiatives include the creation of a workforce training and job placement program to help 100 residents of color, a program to accelerate investments in minority-owned businesses, funds to help the creation of Black-owned media outlets and African heritage cultural organizations, as well as a homeownership fund, said Keith Stokes, the city\u2019s director of business development. \u201cEach and every one of these programs are tied to closing that racial wealth and equity gap,\u201d Stokes told CNN. \u201cOur people and families have been in the outside looking in for fair employment, fair housing, fair educational opportunities, fair health care access, and we\u2019re looking to close that gap in the city of Providence with targeted programs and services.\u201d Because the $10 million is money the city received under the federal American Rescue Plan Act, the program does not limit eligibility to Black residents. The eligibility criteria include Black and Indigenous residents and people facing poverty who were born in Providence, are non-college students who have lived in the city for three years or moved to the city to attend college at least three years ago. There are more than 189,000 people living in Providence, according to US Census data. White residents make up 53.2% of the population, followed 43.5% who are Hispanic or Latino and 16.1% who are Black. At least 23% of the population in Providence lives in poverty, US Census data shows. The city has said the funding is subject to federal regulations, but each initiative has been written to clearly reflect the recommendations made by the reparations commission. Gaines, the local activist, worries many Black and Indigenous people \u201cwho are going to miss out\u201d on the program. The application window for some grants is closing next week and the city is only taking bids for most of the initiatives on Monday. Some of the younger, new business owners or nonprofit leaders may not have the same access to information as others to take advantage of the program given proposals are due so quickly, Gaines said. Stokes told CNN city officials have been reaching out to \u201cany and all potential participants in this program.\u201d \u201cIf people want to debate, process and policy and implementation, absolutely, they should. But the intent here has always been an intent to get these dollars and get these policies and programs out to the people and communities of the greatest need,\u201d Stokes said. Dr. Dannie Ritchie, founder of Community Health Innovations and member of the city\u2019s African American Ambassador Group, said city leaders were so concerned with showing they were doing something on reparations, they failed to take the necessary steps to ensure something tangible could be achieved. \u201cIt\u2019s a catalytic approach to reparations not a transformative approach that would impact nearly all citizens and be sustainable,\u201d Stokes told CNN, adding the state and federal government could partner with cities to rectify racial inequities. While some funds may be awarded before Mayor Jorge Elorza\u2019s term concludes at the end of the month, the city says additional funds from the $10 million will still be administered next year. It\u2019s unclear what the future of reparations efforts in Providence will be in the coming years. Months prior to his election, Mayor-elect Brett Smiley said in a candidate forum he would continue the program but did not discuss any details. CNN has reached out to Smiley for comment.",

            "article_content": "Another year, another Georgia Senate race that\u2019s headed to a runoff election. Neither Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock nor his Republican challenger Herschel Walker, a former football star, crossed the 50% threshold necessary to win outright on Tuesday. In consequence, they must battle at the polls on December 6. But like last year\u2019s races, the upcoming contest has sparked conversations about the troubling history of the runoff system, which some states began using in the final decades of the 19th century to quash Black political power. Speaking with CNN, Gerald Griggs, the president of the Georgia NAACP, made plain some of his concerns about the state of voting rights ahead of next month\u2019s runoff election. In particular, he criticized SB 202, the wide-ranging elections law Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed last year, after Democrats, propelled by Black voters, triumphed in both of the state\u2019s US Senate runoff elections. Racial justice advocates condemned the law, saying that certain elements of it target Black voters. \u201c(Georgia Republicans) shrunk the time for runoff campaigns (from nine weeks to four weeks). And voter registration for the runoff ended the day before the election,\u201d Griggs explained. \u201cThese are attempts to condense the amount of time people have to vote, and thwart mobilization, especially mobilization of African American voters.\u201d He added, \u201cPoliticians need to speak to voters \u2013 not try to suppress them.\u201d To give a little bit more historical context to the runoff system, I spoke with Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University, in Texas. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. What are the origins of runoff elections? The origins of runoff elections go back to the 19th century, when, particularly, they were used in the South. The idea was that the South was only one party, the Democratic Party. There was no effective, competitive second party. How the Georgia Senate runoff will work Most of the states in the South decided that democracy among White men required having a majority to win an election. And since you didn\u2019t have a natural two-party system that would produce a winner with 50%-plus-one of the vote, they had a first election in the Democratic primary and then a runoff if no one got 50% or more, so that the person who took office would\u2019ve gotten a majority vote in that second election. When did runoff elections start getting their darker background story? As we moved further into the Reconstruction era. In several Southern states after the end of slavery and after Black men were allowed to vote, Black people were a majority of the electorate. There were some states where Black people were 40% or so of the electorate. So, the White people who were in control of the legislatures used the runoff to ensure that if there were multiple candidates in the first election and a Black person ran first or even second, the White vote could consolidate in the runoff and defeat that Black candidate. While that didn\u2019t happen very many times, it was the logic after the end of Reconstruction, in the final decades of the 19th century and well into the 20th century. But by the time you got into the 20th century, Black people had effectively been squeezed out of the electorate, so the runoff wasn\u2019t required to defeat them. The thing I think people need to recognize is that the idea of runoff elections has been around for a long time. They were fairly innocuous until after the Civil War, but then they were conceived as a device to restrict the potential of Black people to affect election outcomes. But that was a really fairly transient period, toward the end of the 19th century, because White people excluded Black people from the electorate by the early decades of the 20th century. There wasn\u2019t a very long time when there was the possibility of a large Black vote affecting, let alone determining, outcomes. The runoff election was maintained into the 20th century in the one-party South as a device to ensure that even if only White people were voting, the White candidate who took office as governor or whatever the office was would\u2019ve gotten a majority of the White vote. What do you make of the use of runoff elections today? In the contemporary period \u2013 in which there\u2019s two-party competition in the South, in which there\u2019s a viable Democratic Party in Georgia and elsewhere and a viable Republican Party, too \u2013 often you\u2019re going to get a majority winner since you have a viable two-party system. Sometimes there\u2019ll be third-party candidates, and sometimes even more than three candidates. And then if the vote is very close between the candidates, as it was in this election, you could get a runoff trip you really don\u2019t want. I think that there\u2019s no reason for the runoff. It serves no purpose. It\u2019s a vestige. It should simply be discarded, and we should run plurality elections.",

In 1991, he was convicted of first-degree murder for the shooting death of his friend, Felix Bastarrica. Despite flaws in the case against Ciria \u2013 including the fact that the jury never heard from alibi witnesses \u2013 the Black 29-year-old was sentenced to 31 years to life in prison. Ciria wasn\u2019t released until April of this year. His salvation was an investigation by the San Francisco District Attorney\u2019s Innocence Commission \u2013 a group of experts working to revisit claims of wrongful conviction. If a majority votes to vacate the conviction, the group takes its findings to the DA, who makes the final decision. The DA who secured Ciria\u2019s release: Chesa Boudin. Ciria, now 61, holds a tremendous amount of reverence for Boudin, who in June was booted out of office in a historic, widely-watched recall election. \u201cHe\u2019s not afraid,\u201d Ciria told CNN, referring to Boudin. \u201cHe don\u2019t play politics with people\u2019s lives.\u201d At a time when fears about crime have prompted intense political scrutiny of Boudin and other progressive prosecutors \u2013 last week, Republicans in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives filed articles of impeachment against Larry Krasner, asserting that the Philadelphia DA\u2019s policies are a threat to public safety \u2013 some have argued that the former San Francisco DA\u2019s recall illustrates that the movement is out of touch with voters\u2019 concerns. But the claim that reform-minded prosecutors\u2019 approach is fueling violent crime is false, per recent research. Further, some experts say, to focus overmuch on Boudin\u2019s fate is to disregard progressive prosecutors who are successfully plowing ahead with ambitious agendas as midterm elections loom \u2013 and even to diminish the value of efforts to reshape a system that disproportionately disadvantages people of color. \u201cLess punitive prosecutors are a form of harm reduction, not the solution,\u201d the legal observer Josie Duffy Rice noted earlier this year. \u201cThe paradox of prosecutors is this \u2013 they have the power to cause a lot of problems, but not enough power to solve them.\u201d She added, \u201cProsecutors are still prosecutors. But having someone in office who practices some level of restraint is necessary. It will not fix deeper-rooted problems in San Francisco or anywhere. That\u2019s not the job. But it will reduce harm.\u201d Speaking with CNN, James Forman Jr., a Yale University law professor and the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning 2017 book, \u201cLocking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America,\u201d echoed some of Rice\u2019s sentiments. \u201cFor most of my lifetime, the only way you became a prosecutor was by saying that you were going to lock up more people \u2013 and for longer and in worse conditions \u2013 than your opponent,\u201d said Forman, who used to be a public defender. \u201cThe idea that there\u2019s a new generation of people who are saying things like, \u2018Let\u2019s talk about decriminalizing low-level offenses. Let\u2019s talk about restorative justice. Let\u2019s ask ourselves if a long prison sentence is justified in all of these cases. Let\u2019s look at old convictions to see if they were obtained using false information\u2019 \u2013 we need people asking these questions throughout the system. And one place we need them is in the prosecutor\u2019s office.\u201d As the country prepares for key DA races \u2013 including in San Francisco, Arizona\u2019s Maricopa County (Phoenix) and Minnesota\u2019s Hennepin County (Minneapolis) \u2013 reformist prosecutors and their supporters insist that the movement to rethink the criminal legal system must continue. The freedom of people like Ciria may depend on it. While some argue that Boudin\u2019s recall spells doom for progressive prosecutors elsewhere, such predictions might be rash. For one thing, a number of factors made the election somewhat unique and, in consequence, difficult to draw sweeping conclusions from. \u201cBoudin clearly struggled as a politician, including at one point saying that a person had committed murder during what appeared to be a \u2018temper tantrum.\u2019 And unlike normal elections, recalls do not pit two candidates against each other, and thus may reflect people\u2019s views of the person more than their policies,\u201d the Fordham University law professor John Pfaff wrote for Slate in July. He continued, \u201cNot to mention that it is risky to draw big conclusions from low-turnout elections, something even those pushing a bigger narrative concede. And San Francisco voters were wary of Boudin from the start: By the end of the city\u2019s ranked choice voting process in 2019, he barely won, edging out the much more moderate Suzy Loftus 50.8 percent to 49.2 percent.\u201d Plus, though some progressive prosecutors are embattled \u2013 remember the campaign against Krasner, or the backlash from certain quarters against Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg \u2013 others are experiencing success. For instance, in August, in Chittenden County \u2013 Vermont\u2019s most populous county \u2013 the reformer Sarah George prevailed in her primary. In Contra Costa, California, the progressive-leaning DA Diana Becton won reelection in June. And the month before, in Durham, North Carolina, the reformer Satana Deberry handily won her primary. Boudin summarized why his recall wasn\u2019t a meaningful bellwether moment. \u201cSince my recall, there have been (at least) three major successes for the criminal legal reform movement,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cOne, the failure of the recall against (the Los Angeles County DA) George Gasc\u00f3n. Two, the reelection of Sarah George in Vermont. And three, the ouster of an extremely conservative, reactionary, 10-year incumbent in Tennessee (Amy Weirich) by a progressive reform Democrat (Steve Mulroy).\u201d Like the former San Francisco DA, George is \u201creally optimistic\u201d about the future of progressive prosecution. \u201cAround the same time that Chesa\u2019s recall was successful, there were other progressive DAs in California up for reelection against more tough-on-crime people. They won,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cSo, I feel really good about the movement. I think that it\u2019s definitely growing.\u201d Experts CNN spoke with say that, in the run-up to the midterm elections, it\u2019s important not to lose sight of the fundamental value of attempts to reimagine the country\u2019s criminal legal system. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find people anymore who haven\u2019t been impacted by our legal system, who haven\u2019t seen up close the ways it doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Miriam Krinsky, the executive director of the group Fair and Just Prosecution, told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019ve seen it affect a loved one or a friend or a colleague or a neighbor or some other member of their circle.\u201d She paid special attention to the fact that the traditional tough-on-crime approach disproportionately burdens people of color. \u201cWe know that racial disparities are present at every stage of the criminal system: who gets stopped, who gets arrested, what their treatment is post-arrest, who gets prosecuted, for how long they end up behind bars and, in the most extreme cases, for whom the death penalty is sought and when it\u2019s imposed,\u201d Krinsky added. Lara Bazelon, a law professor at the University of San Francisco and the chair of the Innocence Commission, put some of these sentiments a little bit more bluntly. \u201cBefore the commission existed, no DA in San Francisco\u2019s history had ever agreed to exonerate anyone,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cInstead, they fought tooth and nail to keep innocent people locked up \u2013 which is absolutely shameful, particularly in a city that says that it\u2019s progressive.\u201d Bazelon went on, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that going back to the days of tough on crime is going to make us safe. And I think that there are stacks and stacks of academic and empirical studies that prove that point.\u201d It\u2019s worth reiterating that progressive prosecution is no panacea for crime. \u201cThere\u2019s no single thing that\u2019s going to undo 50 years of harshness built across 50 states and 3,000 counties and every single institution in our criminal system,\u201d Forman, the Yale law professor, said. In short, pushback must come from every quarter: judges who won\u2019t lock up people merely because they\u2019re poor, legislatures that are prepared to revisit long sentences for a wide range of offenses, public defender\u2019s offices that receive more money, prosecutor\u2019s offices that take a progressive approach to the law. Forman explained that, in the future, he\u2019d like to see progressive prosecutors commit to shrinking the size and scope of their offices \u2013 because if they\u2019re successful, they\u2019re going to find ways to reduce crime that don\u2019t rely on policing and prison. \u201cI actually think that victory will be when they\u2019re not needed,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, we know that such a world is probably never going to exist, because every country in the world for all of history has had crimes. But if we set that as a goal, as a dream, we can measure success by whether we\u2019re taking steps in that direction.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The mother of two boys who died following a house fire in Michigan earlier this year is pushing for an independent investigation after two firefighters were accused of lying about properly searching for survivors. Zyaire Mitchell, 12, and his brother Lamar, 9, died soon after a fire at their home in Flint on May 28. Several weeks later, an investigation led by the fire department found two firefighters tasked with the initial search of the room the children were in lied about properly sweeping for victims. Almost seven minutes later, the children were found by other firefighters. Both later died at a hospital from smoke inhalation, their mother said. State fire investigators ruled faulty electrical wiring caused the fire. In his July report, Flint Fire Department Chief Raymond Barton determined the two firefighters \u2014 Daniel Sniegocki and Michael Zlotek \u2014 should be terminated from the department, \u201cdue to the nature of the incident in question, and the actions or lack of action possibly contributing to the loss of life of two victims.\u201d But instead, the city accepted the resignation of one of the firefighters and a second was \u201cdisciplined,\u201d Barton said in August, without elaborating on what disciplinary actions were taken. On Friday, the city provided CNN with a copy of a letter sent to Zlotek dated July 28 detailing his two-week suspension. Barton refused to comment further on the investigation or its outcomes when contacted by CNN on Saturday. Attorney Robert Kenner, who is representing the boys\u2019 mother, said he thinks there is an indication of racial bias in the way the investigation has been handled because the children were Black. \u201cI can\u2019t say in good faith that these firemen intentionally failed at their responsibility because these boys were African Americans, I would never say that,\u201d Kenner said. \u201cI think the way it was handled subsequent to the boys being found was a disparity in how others have been treated.\u201d Speaking at a press conference Friday, the boys\u2019 mother, Crystal Cooper, said, \u201cOnly if I could just give six minutes, my babies would still be here with me. I just want justice for them. They didn\u2019t deserve this. Every day is a struggle knowing that I won\u2019t see them anymore.\u201d Kenner accused the city of a coverup and on Friday called for another investigation. \u201cThere was an investigation by a Chief Raymond Barton and, what he found, was that two firemen \u2014 Daniel Sniegocki and Michael Zlotek \u2014 fabricated and lied on a report and said that they checked the room,\u201d Kenner said. \u201cBased on what they said, the chief did his own investigation and what was uncovered was they couldn\u2019t have checked the room, they didn\u2019t even mention anything about a bed, the location of the bed, the location of items.\u201d \u201cNo parent should ever have to go through this,\u201d the attorney added. \u201cNo parent. So, what we\u2019re calling for, we\u2019re calling for a thorough investigation, an earnest investigation, no cover-ups, no change in documents. We\u2019re calling for the truth.\u201d Kenner on Saturday told CNN the decision not to terminate the firefighters came from the office of Flint Mayor Sheldon Neeley. A representative of Flint Firefighters Local 352 told The Flint Journal that the two firefighters are being scapegoated in the matter because they failed to search a small room on the second floor of the home due to extreme heat and low visibility. CNN has reached out to the union for comment. \u201cThe mayor is in a hotly contested race right now and made the decision not to terminate based on political reasons,\u201d Kenner claimed. \u201cHe\u2019s tied to the fire union and didn\u2019t want to upset the union or other constituents.\u201d Neeley is facing former Mayor Karen Weaver in the election on Tuesday. Neeley, the mayor, told CNN, \u201cThere is absolutely no truth to the allegation that there is a cover up.\u201d \u201cWe continue to lift this family in prayer, and we are sad to see their pain shamefully exploited,\u201d he added. CNN has attempted to contact Zlotek and Daniel Sniegocki for comment. CNN\u2019s Isa Kaufman-Geballe contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. California\u2019s 45th Congressional District, straddling Orange and Los Angeles counties, is as perfect an illustration of the diversity and power of Asian American voters as might be possible. The contest features a duel between two Asian Americans: Jay Chen, a Democrat, is battling Michelle Steel, the Republican incumbent, for a House seat. And the Asian American voters who make up about a third of the district\u2019s electorate will play a significant role in determining the outcome of the intensely competitive race. \u201cI think that this race epitomizes the diversity of the Asian American community. You\u2019re seeing a Korean immigrant incumbent, who\u2019s a Republican, being challenged by a Taiwanese American Democrat, and her strategy is to stoke anti-Chinese sentiment by campaigning in the Vietnamese immigrant community,\u201d Connie Chung Joe, the CEO of Asian Americans Advancing Justice \u2013 Los Angeles, told CNN, referring to criticisms that Steel is seeking to tap into anxieties about China\u2019s influence in the region by calling Chen \u201cChina\u2019s Choice\u201d in some of her attack ads. \u201cAnd when you look at the district, you see that it\u2019s heavily Asian American.\u201d Experts hope that the contest will do two things: underline the fact that Asian American voters are no monolith, and snap into focus the importance of investing in campaign outreach to a ballooning electoral force. \u201cI see this race as a kind of wake-up call that the API community is vast and important,\u201d Joe said. \u201cAsian Americans are the fastest growing racial demographic in this country, and they do vote. Georgia showed us in 2020 how critical these voters can be in swinging things. And we\u2019re seeing that again today.\u201d Just a few years ago, Asian Americans emerged as a key voting bloc and helped to put Joe Biden in the White House and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the US Senate. Karthick Ramakrishnan, the founder and director of the nonprofit group AAPI Data and a professor of political science and public policy at the University of California, Riverside, echoed some of Joe\u2019s sentiments. \u201cThe Asian American vote, even though it\u2019s not large, is big enough to make a difference,\u201d he explained. \u201cThis district in California is part of that story.\u201d It\u2019s hard to overstate how diverse the 45th District is. An independent commission recently redrew the district to keep together residents of Indian, Vietnamese, Korean and Chinese descent, and grant them greater electoral power. \u201cThis district brings together the Vietnamese community of Little Saigon and goes up into Little India,\u201d Sara Sadhwani, a senior researcher at AAPI Data and an assistant professor of politics at Pomona College, told CNN. \u201cThat being said, while those two historic neighborhoods are there, the area also has a large number of Korean Americans and Chinese Americans.\u201d The district\u2019s political diversity is striking, too. Data from the Pew Research Center show that there\u2019s broad convergence among Asian Americans on issues such as education, violent crime and health care. But as with any group, when we move away from public opinion and toward party identification, there are meaningful differences. \u201cYou find that most Asian Americans are Democratic-leaning, but the strength of that lean varies by national origin or by age or by immigrant generation,\u201d Ramakrishnan said. A Pew survey from August reported that 57% of English-speaking, Asian registered voters said that they\u2019d likely back the Democratic candidate in the House race in their district, while only 26% said that they\u2019d support the Republican candidate. Per AAPI Data, Indian Americans are the most Democratic-leaning group among Asian American voters. Meanwhile, Vietnamese Americans lean more Republican than voters of other Asian backgrounds or heritages. (Notably, former President Donald Trump seemed to make slight gains with some Asian Americans in 2020.) Joe painted a more vivid picture of this variation, though data are limited. \u201cAs a whole, Asian Americans tend to be slightly more Democratic than Republican,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut when you cut into the subgroups, what you find is that the older generation of Vietnamese immigrants, for instance, tends to be very largely Republican. And that\u2019s true with certain other groups, too. Older Korean immigrants tend to be more Republican. But younger Asian American voters tend to be more Democratic and progressive.\u201d Steel appears to be trying to use some of these differences to her advantage. Earlier this year, her campaign sent mailers to Vietnamese Americans in Orange County that portray Chen as a communist teacher. \u201cEspecially among the first generation of Vietnamese Americans who escaped Vietnam and have carried with them to the US feelings of persecution, there\u2019s a real sense that communism should absolutely not take root here,\u201d Sadhwani said. \u201cWhenever you invoke communism, it draws attention and stokes fear among some voters about the politics a Democrat might have.\u201d She added that it\u2019s interesting to see the aforementioned communities battle between a Korean American and a Taiwanese American. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely talking about a kind of ethnic representation for the district, no matter who wins,\u201d Sadhwani said. The contest underscores that campaign outreach to Asian American voters requires investment and sophistication, according to experts. \u201cOne of the things about API voters is that many of them are naturalized citizens, and English isn\u2019t their first language,\u201d Joe explained. \u201cAsian American voters aren\u2019t only a lot of ethnicities. We also speak so many different languages. If you look here in Southern California, there are more than 40 different API ethnic groups that speak more than 40 different languages.\u201d In other words, everything must be language accessible. The Asian American Power Network, a left-leaning advocacy group, kicked off a $10 million push in September to mobilize Asian American voters in seven battleground states who speak different languages. \u201cWhen you think about the entire country and how to reach groups, those on-the-ground mobilization efforts often involve people who are from the community and who speak the language of the community getting information to voters and explaining to them why it\u2019s important to vote,\u201d Joe added. The country\u2019s two main political parties, experts say, appear to struggle to appeal to Asian American voters. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of model for how to talk with Black voters. Even if the model needs to be refined, there\u2019s a starting point,\u201d Michael Li, a senior counsel in the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, told CNN. \u201cWith Asian American voters, outreach can be more complicated. I think that both parties are still trying to figure out the best way to engage a group of diverse voters.\u201d Sadhwani expressed similar sentiments about the state of outreach to Asian American voters. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve consistently found over the past 15 years of survey analysis is many Asian Americans \u2013 and Latinos \u2013 reporting that no one bothers to knock on their door or call them to encourage them to vote, because those voters don\u2019t often pop up on lists of likely voters. And that\u2019s a real problem,\u201d she said. This isn\u2019t to downplay crucial changes in recent years. Over the last few election cycles, we\u2019ve seen candidates in places with growing Asian American populations and in competitive districts \u2013 from Orange County to Houston to Northern Virginia to the suburbs of Atlanta \u2013 begin to reach out to Asian American communities, and do so in culturally competent ways. But are parties embracing this mindset on a national level? \u201cHard to say,\u201d Sadhwani cautioned. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like parties are necessarily putting a whole lot of stock into outreach \u2013 except in a handful of really competitive places.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Los Angeles City Council member Nury Martinez has resigned as the legislative body\u2019s president after making racist remarks about a fellow council member and his Black child. \u201cI take responsibility for what I said and there are no excuses for those comments,\u201d Martinez said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Martinez\u2019 resignation as president is effective immediately, according to the statement, though she remains a member of the council. The remarks were part of leaked audio that was posted anonymously on Reddit and obtained by The Los Angeles Times. According to the newspaper, the audio details a conversation between Martinez, Councilmembers Gil Cedillo and Kevin de Le\u00f3n and Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera. Bass has chance to make history in Los Angeles mayoral race Much of the conversation focused on maps proposed by the city\u2019s redistricting commission and the councilmembers\u2019 frustration with them, as well as the need to \u201censure that heavily Latino districts did not lose economic assets\u201d in the once-in-a-decade process, according to the Times. The councilmembers then discussed Councilmember Mike Bonin, a White man. In clips of the leaked audio posted by the Times, Martinez is heard recounting a conversation and says \u201cBonin thinks he\u2019s f**king Black.\u201d According to the Times, Martinez says Bonin appeared with his son on a float in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade and he \u201chandled his young Black son as though he were an accessory.\u201d The boy is 8 years old, according to a Facebook post by his father. The Times reported that Martinez also said of Bonin\u2019s child, \u201cParece changuito,\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s like a monkey.\u201d In the leaked audio, Martinez can be heard speaking about Bonin\u2019s son allegedly misbehaving while at the parade by hanging from a railing of their float, saying \u201cthis kid is going to tip us over.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re raising him like a little White kid,\u201d Martinez said in the audio released by The Times. \u201cI was like, this kid needs a beatdown. Let me take him around the corner and then I\u2019ll bring him back.\u201d Should vacant hotels in Los Angeles house the homeless? Voters will decide. The audio, according to The Times, was part of a conversation that took place in October 2021. CNN has not been able to verify the audio recording. It surfaced just weeks before the November 8 election that will decide the next mayor of Los Angeles and several city council seats. It is unclear who recorded the audio. \u201cThe context of this conversation was concern over the redistricting process and concern about the potential negative impact it might have on communities of color. My work speaks for itself. I\u2019ve worked hard to lead this city through its most difficult time,\u201d Martinez said in a statement to CNN, made before her resignation. Bonin and his husband, Sean Arian, had asked the City Council to remove Martinez as council president and said she needs to resign from office. \u201cWe are appalled, angry and absolutely disgusted that Nury Martinez attacked our son with horrific racist slurs, and talked about her desire to physically harm him. It\u2019s vile, abhorrent, and utterly disgraceful,\u201d the couple said in a joint statement. Our family statement about today's ugly and hateful news. pic.twitter.com/0fPPXwsS5B Bonin and Arian added that they are \u201cequally angry and disgusted by the ugly racist comments about our son from Kevin de Le\u00f3n and Ron Herrera, who should also resign their posts, and by the tacit acceptance of those remarks from Gil Cedillo.\u201d The California/Hawaii State Conference of the NAACP and the Los Angeles Branch of the organization are calling for the resignation of all council members involved in that conversation and asking the city to investigate \u201chow far the racial animus has impacted hiring and other decisions of the City Council,\u201d they said in a joint statement. \u201cWe will not sit idly by and allow our elected representatives to engage in these kinds of disgusting and racist behaviors,\u201d said Latricia Mitchell, president of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP. Council member Nithya Raman, who according to The Times was also referenced in the leaked audio, released a statement to CNN Sunday also calling for resignations. \u201cRacist, homophobic, and deeply cruel statements like these are disqualifying for elected office in LA. The people who made them should resign. If they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll vote to remove them from Council leadership at the first opportunity,\u201d Raman said. In a statement Sunday, Cedillo called the comments about Bonin\u2019s son \u201csimply unacceptable.\u201d \u201cI want to start by apologizing. While I did not engage in the conversation in question, I was present at times during this meeting last year,\u201d Cedillo said. \u201cIt is my instinct to hold others accountable when they use derogatory or racially divisive language. Clearly, I should have intervened. I failed in holding others and myself to the highest standard. The hurtful and harmful remarks made about my colleague\u2019s son were simply unacceptable. We choose public life, but our families should always be off limits and never part of the political discourse.\u201d Herrera has not responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment, but the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO tweeted an apology from him to Bonin and his family and Black and Oaxacan community members. \u201cThere is no justification and no excuse for the vile remarks made in that room. Period,\u201d the apology said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t step up to stop them and I will have to bear the burden of that cross moving forward.\u201d De Le\u00f3n released a statement to CNN Sunday saying, \u201cOn that day, I fell short of the expectations we set for our leaders \u2013 and I will hold myself to a higher standard. \u201cThere were comments made in the context of this meeting that are wholly inappropriate; and I regret appearing to condone and even contribute to certain insensitive comments made about a colleague and his family in private. I\u2019ve reached out to that colleague personally,\u201d de Le\u00f3n said. Despite the apologies, Bonin and Arian point to what they call a coordinated effort to weaken Black political representation in Los Angeles. \u201cThe conversation revealed several layers of contempt for the people of Los Angeles, and a cynical, ugly desire to divide the City rather than serve it,\u201d Bonin and Arian said in their statement. In her statement announcing her resignation, Martinez apologized to Bonin and his family. \u201cAs a mother, I know better and I am sorry. I am truly ashamed. I know this is the result of my own actions. I\u2019m sorry to your entire family for putting you through this,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAs someone who believes deeply in the empowerment of communities of color, I recognize my comments undercut that goal,\u201d the statement said. \u201cGoing forward, reconciliation will be my priority.\u201d Martinez represents the city\u2019s 6th district, which includes Hollywood, Panorama City and other parts of the San Fernando Valley.

            "article_content": "Here is a look at the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which serves to protect and enforce the 14th and 15th Amendments. It was enacted in response to voter suppression in the 1960s by state governments, local governments and law enforcement. Original jurisdictions: Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Virginia. Also, subdivisions, mostly counties, in Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho and North Carolina. Jurisdictions are made based on a formula containing two elements: If less than 50% of the voting age population is registered to vote by November 1, 1964, or if less than 50% voted in the 1964 presidential election. It also guarantees the right to register and vote to citizens with \u201climited English proficiency.\u201d Section 2: States the right to vote cannot be denied on the basis of race or color. Section 3: Upholds the ability to enforce the 15th Amendment. Section 4:  Says citizen cannot be denied the right to vote for failed compliance with devices such as literacy tests. It also designates the formulated jurisdictions outlined in Section 5. The requirement for preclearance of voting changes was ruled unconstitutional in a 2013 US Supreme Court decision. \u201cThe effect of the Shelby County decision is that the jurisdictions identified by the coverage formula in Section 4(b) no longer need to seek preclearance for the new voting changes, unless they are covered by a separate court order entered under Section 3(c) of the Voting Rights Act.\u201d Section 5: This section freezes \u201cchanges in election practices or procedures in covered jurisdictions\u201d until the new procedures have been subjected to review. Review can only be done by the US Attorney General or by filing a lawsuit before the US District Court for the District of Columbia. Yet Section 5 is basically unenforceable as there is no longer a preclearance requirement in Section 4. Read More: America has a long history of resisting multiracial democracy. March 7, 1965 - Bloody Sunday - About 600 non-violent voting rights marchers heading to Montgomery, Alabama\u2019s state capital, are attacked by state troopers in Selma. March 15, 1965 - President Lyndon Johnson, in a speech before a joint session of Congress says: \u201cThere is no constitutional issue here. The command of the Constitution is plain. There is no moral issue. It is wrong, deadly wrong, to deny any of your fellow Americans the right to vote in this country.\u201d August 6, 1965 - Is signed into law by President Johnson to protect and enforce the 15th Amendment. 1970 - Congress extends provisions for five years, changing the formula in Section 4 to reflect 1968 (instead of 1964). Coverage is added in jurisdictions within 10 more states: Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Wyoming. Connecticut, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts and Wyoming win \u201cbailout\u201d lawsuits. 1975 - Congress extends provisions for seven years, changes the formula to 1972 and broadens the discrimination description as also encompassing American Indians, Asian Americans, Alaskan Natives or people of Spanish heritage. This addition to the formula essentially covers Alaska, Arizona and Texas, and includes parts of California, Florida, Michigan, New York, North Carolina and South Dakota. 1982 - Congress extends the special provisions in Section 4 for 25 years, but makes no changes. 2006 - Congress renews special provisions and extends the act until 2031. June 25, 2013 - The US Supreme Court decides (5-4) that formulated jurisdictions under Section 5 no longer have to have new voting laws pre-cleared by the attorney general or the federal district court in the District of Columbia. Chief Justice John Roberts explains that \u201cour country has changed\u201d and the formula \u201cno longer characterize(s) voting in the covered jurisdictions.\u201d February 11, 2015 - An amendment to the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1964 is introduced to the House of Representatives. The Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015 is focused on updating a portion of the law after the US Supreme Court struck down an \u201coutdated\u201d portion of VRA that protected racial discrimination in voting. March 7, 2015 - President Barack Obama signs legislation awarding the Congressional Gold Medal \u201cto the Foot Soldiers who participated in the Bloody Sunday, Turnaround Tuesday, or the final Selma to Montgomery Voting Rights March in March of 1965, which served as a catalyst for the Voting Rights Act.\u201d September 12, 2018 - The report, \u201cAn Assessment of Minority Voting Rights Access in the United States,\u201d is released by the US Commission on Civil Rights. The bipartisan agency concludes that new state laws are making it more difficult for minorities to vote. It also notes that the Justice Department has done less to challenge those discriminatory laws since the Supreme Court struck down a core element of the 1965 Voting Rights Act in 2013. December 6, 2019 - The House of Representatives votes to pass the Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 (introduced February 26). The bill \u201cestablishes new criteria for determining which states and political subdivisions must obtain preclearance before changes to voting practices in these areas may take effect.\u201d July 22, 2020 - The Voting Rights Advancement Act of 2019 is introduced in the Senate. It is renamed the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act after the July 17 death of the congressman and civil rights leader. July 1, 2021 - The US Supreme Court decides (6-3) that two provisions of an Arizona voting law that restrict how ballots can be cast do not violate the Voting Rights Act that bars regulations that result in racial discrimination. The ruling by the conservative-majority court will limit the ability of minorities to challenge state laws in the future that they say are discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act. February 7, 2022 - In a 5-4 decision, the US Supreme court allows a congressional map drawn by Alabama Republicans to remain in place, freezing a lower court ruling that said the map likely violates the Voting Rights Act by diluting the political power of African American voters.",

            "article_content": "When school officials in New York removed 11 books they disliked from library shelves, 17-year-old Steven Pico joined a legal fight that would eventually take him and his school to the US Supreme Court. In 1976, Pico was a high school student at the Island Trees Union Free School District in Levittown, New York when the school board ordered the removal of several books from the junior high and high school libraries, including \u201cSlaughterhouse-Five\u201d by Kurt Vonnegut and \u201cBest Short Stories of Negro Writers\u201d edited by Langston Hughes. The books were part of a list of \u201cobjectionable\u201d books that some board members obtained months before when they attended a conference by the conservative group Parents of New York United. When Pico learned about the board\u2019s actions, he and a few other students filed a lawsuit in 1977 with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union to try to get the books back into the libraries. This month marks 40 years since Pico\u2019s fight in court ended as the Supreme Court recognized the First Amendment rights of students in Island Trees Union Free School District v. Pico and ruled that school boards may not remove books because they dislike the ideas contained in those titles. But for Pico, now 62 years old and who became a painter, editor and advocate for First Amendment rights, the case continues to resonate as America faces a new wave of book challenges. In the past year, authors of color exploring history, racism or their own experiences in America have been targeted by a record number of challenges. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called on his state\u2019s school boards to remove books he described as \u201cpornography\u201d and school districts across the country have pulled books reported as \u201cinappropriate\u201d from their library shelves. \u201cI believe that schools have a responsibility to teach all ideas, not just the ideas with which they agree,\u201d Pico said. Pico spoke with CNN about how the landmark 1982 Supreme Court case impacted his life and whether efforts to ban books in the United States have changed through the decades. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Why was book censorship such an important issue for you as a high school student that you decided to challenge your school district in court? I think the freedom to read a book is the foundation of our democracy. It\u2019s under attack today. Basic freedoms are under attack around the world and inside the United States. It was the same in 1977 and it\u2019s the same right now. When people ban books, the victims here are the books, the ideas, the students, the teachers, the librarian, and our form of democracy. What happened in my school district was political. Schools and school board members have an obligation to teach all ideas in the United States, not just the ideas that align with their politics. Six years passed before the Supreme Court ruled on the case. You graduated high school and even college but you did not forget about the case. How was your life during that time as the lead plaintiff? It was busy. I held a press conference in 1977 when I was 17 years old with author Kurt Vonnegut Jr (whose book \u201cSlaughterhouse-Five\u201d had been removed from library shelves) and we announced the lawsuit against the school. I graduated a few months later,  went to Haverford College in Pennsylvania and got my degree. I took time throughout college to do interviews, to raise money for the case, do speeches and raise awareness for the case.  After I graduated college my first job was at the National Coalition Against Censorship where I worked for three additional years to try to change laws and put policies in place to prevent (book) removals in the future. Prior to this interview, you had mentioned that many of your classmates were apathetic or had other priorities like getting into college and that for the most part, you didn\u2019t feel supported. When the lawsuit became public, I didn\u2019t see a lot of support and even my own parents had a lot of doubts. They were not particularly supportive of the lawsuit because they thought it was perceived as troublemaking and that I might not get into college or I might not get certain scholarships that I was eligible for because I was taking a stand that in my community was very unpopular. I think today students are much more sophisticated.  They have more knowledge about their rights as citizens. I actually have much more hope today that these battles are going to be fought and won. I know there are young people out there right now who are forming book clubs, groups where they\u2019re going to actually read banned books and decide for themselves. I know there\u2019s young people standing up, fighting these attempts at book censorship and that\u2019s really encouraging because that did not happen when I was in school. Most students were just simply unaware of their rights but today, young people are acutely aware of their rights. I\u2019m really proud of them. I know that they\u2019re not going to just sit back and take this. Students are getting organized and are fighting back against book bans in many ways. For example, there are two students in Missouri who sued their school district earlier this year over the removal of books that are by and about communities of color and LGBTQ people.  What is your message to them? One thing I was told in the 1970s was that \u201cthis is going to be the most important thing you do in your entire life.\u201d Whether that\u2019s true or not, I want the young people out there to hear what I heard and know that their advocacy is not just about their rights, but it\u2019s about all students\u2019 rights across the United States. Conservative views are playing a role in the current efforts to remove certain books from school libraries. Some books are being singled out by politicians for allegedly having \u201cprofane, vulgar or indecent\u201d content. Has the debate over books in America changed 40 years after your case reached the Supreme Court? There is a political agenda behind book censorship. At least one political party in America is trying to scare parents and trying to influence how they vote in the upcoming elections. I think local and state politicians in the Republican Party right now are trying to galvanize their voters by putting fear into parents whose votes they may have lost in the last election. I think this is a scare tactic. Having local politicians decide which books cannot be used in schools was precisely the situation I confronted in 1976. No one in my community in New York, in 1976, objected to any of the 11 books that were removed and banned. No student no teacher, no librarian, no parent, no member of my entire community, which included four high schools ever complained about any of the books that were ultimately banned. My school board went outside the community found a list of so called objectionable books. They did not read the books in their entirety. They used a handful of excerpts, a handful of words, a handful of vulgarities to make these books look bad. You have to judge books in their entirety and that\u2019s not what these politicians and school boards are doing, then and now. You are saying that throughout the decades, America is still having the same or a very similar debate over books and censorship. How can we move forward? Is there a solution to this long lasting dispute? I think the solution in America is always to have more ideas and to have more discussion and to have more free speech. It\u2019s not controlling what people read and think, we have to do this the American way. Young people and older people need to go out and buy banned books. They need to make judgments for themselves. They need to read the books in their entirety. They need to adopt a banned book. To think that children today are naive, is foolish. They go home, they turn on the news, or they read it on their phone\u2026 they know what\u2019s going on around the world. They know that the ideas that they hear are serious, complex and need to be understood. I think these controversial personal stories, like drug abuse, racial discrimination, anti-Semitism, violence against youths and adults because of their sexual preferences, these things need to be discussed. Young people need to be prepared to deal with these issues when they turn 18 and when they leave high school. I think the best place to discuss these issues is in the classroom, where they can discuss it with their peers, and there\u2019s a trained professional there to help them understand what they\u2019re reading and why.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. If the racial discrimination lawsuit against Tesla is any indication, then it makes sense that the news about Elon Musk\u2019s possible takeover of Twitter has unsettled many of the social media platform\u2019s Black users. While the site has become increasingly venomous over the years, it has also allowed Black users to deepen kinship bonds and elevate movements. Now, that community-building might be in jeopardy. \u201cThere\u2019s an innate sense of dread,\u201d Meredith Clark, an associate professor at the School of Journalism and the Department of Communication Studies at Northeastern University, told CNN. \u201cAnd I think that it comes not just from the announcement that Musk might buy Twitter.\u201d Clark explained that, for many Black Americans, the past decade has been rife with social and political turbulence. There was the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, the 2016 election that installed in the White House a man who struggled to condemn White supremacy and the 2020 contest during which plenty of Republican Party leaders suggested that Black votes shouldn\u2019t count, on top of so much else. \u201cThe only reason that (the Musk announcement) is sort of on the same wave as those other events is that this is a person who has made a number of statements that are concerning to Black people,\u201d Clark said. \u201cHe\u2019s a son of apartheid. He\u2019s in the middle of a discrimination lawsuit brought by Black employees at his Tesla plants.\u201d Clark minced no words, \u201cYou have to be concerned about what it means not only for another billionaire to be playing with money in a way that affects something that represents connection and that you enjoy but for this billionaire, with a specific history, to be the person behind that intended purchase.\u201d To understand what might be at stake, let\u2019s pause for a moment to explore the communal dimension of Twitter that Clark nodded to. In the early 2010s, when Twitter, which launched in 2006, was still relatively fresh, the site had a dramatically different atmosphere. People were more likely to tweet about fairly mundane things: school gossip, lunch, Shonda Rhimes\u2019 hit TV series \u201cScandal.\u201d Twitter was a place where ordinary people could talk about ordinary things. It was also a place where ordinary people could do extraordinary things, such as fuel grassroots movements. \u201cWhen you think about the folks who were helping to trend hashtags like #TrayvonMartin or #BlackLivesMatter, while there were sometimes activists involved and eventually celebrities, very often the folks who initiated those hashtags and helped to trend them were ordinary people who cared deeply about these issues and had experiences that they collectively felt needed to be heard,\u201d explained Sarah J. Jackson, a presidential associate professor at the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania and the co-author of \u201c#HashtagActivism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice.\u201d \u201cAnd because of the infrastructure of Twitter, the platform wasn\u2019t limited to people you knew.\u201d America's disdain for Black men and boys hasn't diminished in the years since Trayvon Martin was killed Consider Khary Penebaker. Thanks to Twitter, the Wisconsin Democratic National Committee member was able to expand his gun control advocacy nearly a decade ago. \u201cI would\u2019ve never been able to get my message out as broadly as I did without Twitter,\u201d Penebaker told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve become really good friends with Cory Booker, and that was a byproduct of my being able to reach him via Twitter and have him listen to my story. When he ran for president (in 2020), he included a policy plank in his platform that was specific to my story about how my mom shot and killed herself with a gun.\u201d It\u2019s worth emphasizing that, in some ways, the above describes Black Twitter; as my CNN colleague Lisa France put it in 2015, Black Twitter is \u201ca group of individuals who come together to have conversations about everything from culture to race and identity.\u201d Or think of it like this: Much of the allure of Twitter in its younger years was that it allowed people, especially Black Americans and the members of other marginalized groups who didn\u2019t have the megaphone of a big media platform, to forge connections \u2013 to take up space. But over the years, the platform has gotten worse, particularly for those for whom it had long been a more obvious good. \u201cSomething we were hyper-aware of as we were writing \u2018#HashtagActivism\u2019 was that the Twitter we started studying in 2014 \u2013 with every passing moment, it was a different Twitter,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cThe more people joined \u2013 the more mainstream media journalists and politicians and companies took up Twitter \u2013 the more it changed.\u201d In time, bots and trolls and bad actors inundated the site. \u201cYou could no longer assume that if someone replied to your tweet, they really wanted to engage in a conversation or debate with you,\u201d Jackson said. It\u2019s the ever-deteriorating state of Twitter that makes the news about Musk, one of the most influential agitators on the site, troubling to many Black users, who are unnerved by how Musk seems to conflate \u201cfree speech\u201d with \u201csympathy for bigotry against marginalized groups.\u201d For some, the announcement was enough to make them quit Twitter altogether. \u201cThe moment I heard about the offer, I was like, \u2018I\u2019m out.\u2019 It was the easiest social media decision I\u2019ve made, ever,\u201d the writer Ijeoma Oluo told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a part of a platform that would even accept something like this.\u201d Oluo laid out that what makes Musk so upsetting to her is his behavior on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the way he responds to challenges or perceived insults. It\u2019s also the way he requires a foil, someone to fight with,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like I was becoming one of those people whose relevance to Twitter was as a target. And I didn\u2019t want to be a part of why some people go to Twitter \u2013 to harass Black people and trans people and other marginalized people, especially when we try to flex the power we have to keep it safe.\u201d Twitter has been focused on 'healthy conversations.' Elon Musk could change that \u201cThat collective power is something that terrifies many White men, particularly White men who think that tech is theirs,\u201d Oluo continued. \u201cAnd I really wish that people cared even half as much about the ways that so many voices have been pushed out of online spaces as they do about one billionaire\u2019s desire to throw a fit on the internet.\u201d Jackson echoed some of Oluo\u2019s sentiments. \u201cMusk has been outspoken on Twitter about what appears to be a distaste for progressive politics,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also known as this chaos agent. Some people consider him to be someone who enjoys \u2018trolling for fun.\u2019 So, for me, the news raised concerns that somebody who doesn\u2019t seem to value democratic values at least as I define them \u2013 in terms of people having access to and safety in the public sphere \u2013 might be taking over the platform.\u201d Yet Jackson is staying on Twitter \u2013 for now, anyway. \u201cStaying is conditional,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a few wait-and-see questions. For instance, is the site going to be managed in a new way, both in terms of its corporate ethics and in terms of things like how the algorithm works and how hate speech is or isn\u2019t tolerated?\u201d Crucially, while Twitter has been socially and politically valuable, particularly to Black Americans, it wouldn\u2019t be the end of the world if the site were to cease being the preferred platform for deliberation and expression. That\u2019s because those things can move elsewhere. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that space is,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cBut I have faith in people to figure it out, to innovate. So, I think that we have to be careful. This (the Musk news) is a very good reason to feel dismay. But also, platforms aren\u2019t permanent. Technologies aren\u2019t permanent. They\u2019re always changing.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Some Republicans and far-right groups\u2019 attacks on voting rights and American democracy are making it harder for Black people to achieve racial equality, according to a new report from the National Urban League. The civil rights organization on Tuesday released its annual State of Black America report, titled \u201cUnder Siege: The Plot to Destroy Democracy.\u201d Among other things, the findings showed the social and economic status of Black Americans; how African Americans felt about social justice issues; and revealed the various tactics that make it harder for Black people to vote. Citing a record number of voters from communities of color using mail-in ballots and early voting, the authors say partisan politicians in state legislatures around the country have drafted bills and passed laws making it harder for Black Americans to vote and they see no signs of the effort slowing down. \u201cHistoric voter turnout in the 2020 election sparked the beginning of one of the most insidious partisan attacks on voting rights in American history,\u201d the authors of the report write. Marc Morial, the president and CEO of the National Urban League, told CNN that without the right to vote for Black people, racial equity cannot be achieved. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have the right to vote for officials who share the concerns of our community, we have no voice,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no say and American democracy is undermined. We will fight to protect American democracy and the right to vote until hell freezes over.\u201d Before 2020, absentee voting was neither controversial nor subject to legislative attack, according to the report. \u201cRepublicans passed no-excuse absentee voting in Georgia in 2005.\u201d And as recently as 2019, broad bipartisan majorities expanded access to absentee voting in Pennsylvania. But \u201cafter 2020, the first year that nonwhite voters began relying on mail voting in large numbers, mail voting became the subject of intense and politicized scrutiny across America,\u201d the authors wrote. In Georgia, for example, nearly 30% of Black voters cast their ballots by mail, compared to 24% of White voters \u2014 a reversal from past behaviors. More than 1.3 million Georgians voted absentee. In 2021, 19 states passed 34 laws making it harder for Black people to vote by making mail-in voting more difficult, imposing strict signature requirements and reducing polling place availability, according to the report. The report also reveals that this year, 18 states have already carried over at least 152 restrictive bills from the previous legislative session. Combating the assault on voting rights should be the number one priority for Black Americans to ensure challenges and disparities that Black Americans face are dealt with from the ground up, Morial told CNN. The National Urban League worked with Benenson Strategy Group and conducted about 1,674 interviews online earlier this March among people living in the United States from ages 18 and older to get insight on the issues that Black Americans face. The Urban League marked the report\u2019s release with a special launch event Tuesday that brought together the group\u2019s leaders, members of Congress, civil rights activists, as well as the next generation of leaders. The civil rights organization chose to host event at Clark Atlanta University in Atlanta because they say Georgia is ground zero for voter suppression. \u201cEven with our rich civil rights legacy and progress, Georgia right now is ground zero for the fight to protect our democracy,\u201d Nancy Flake Johnson, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Atlanta said Tuesday. \u201cWe are embracing the task of re-educating voters on the power, the history, the privilege and the urgency of now for voting.\u201d At the launch event, Mayor of Atlanta Andre Dickens stressed the importance of voting in the upcoming election. \u201cOur state was just one of 49 states where legislation was introduced over the last year that will restrict access to the ballot box,\u201d Dickens said. \u201cRemember that it is imperative that we remain politically engaged and active. This is the way we will move our city forward.\u201d The report also found that the main tactics that restrict voting rights include gerrymandering, voter suppression, election sabotage and intimidation. The executive summary of the report says the redrawing of congressional maps, extremely strict voter ID laws and efforts to discredit votes are attempts to silence Black voices. \u201cI\u2019m extremely concerned that these efforts will have an impact,\u201d Morial said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to do everything in the courts, in the political arena, in the court of public opinion, to organize efforts to counteract it. We have to counteract it because it is so corrosive and so damaging to American democracy.\u201d Morial also said the National Urban League is also encouraging Black voters to support candidates \u2014 both locally and nationally \u2014 who not only publicly go on record in support of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, but who are also in opposition to the use of the filibuster block. The annual report also calculates an Equality Index every year that reveals the disparities for Black Americans relative to White Americans in economic opportunity, education, health, social justice and civic engagement. Authors of the report also surveyed thousands of Black and White people to gauge their views on issues of race and justice in America. One of the main goals of the report is to help Black Americans reclaim their right to vote in every election. The National Urban League plans to advise many Black communities through the upcoming midterm elections to ensure a record turnout later this year, Morial said. They also plan to launch a civic engagement campaign called \u201cReclaim Your Vote\u201d to ensure the integrity of future elections so that Black Americans can be put on a path to racial equality. \u201cFrustration is not a strategy, and it leads to dejection and defeat if we allow it to consume our thinking,\u201d Morial said. \u201cWe have to push back even in the most difficult times we have faced as people. The times demand that we be resolute.\u201d",

            "article_content": "People wake up and choose violence every day. In many ways, it\u2019s human nature. Headlines daily chronicle war, murder, crime, road rage, social media threats and trivial disputes that turn deadly, which is why the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta continues spreading King\u2019s teachings on a more irenic way of life. The center\u2019s namesake is one of humanity\u2019s great brokers of peace. A preacher and scholar, King relied not just on charisma but on coalitions which he and his acolytes schooled in nonviolence, inspired in part by Mohandas Gandhi\u2019s movement in India. The discipline made sense in the 1950s and 1960s when peaceful protesters were met by \u201cBull\u201d Connor or Sheriff Jim Clark, who unleashed the full venom of law enforcement. Protesters\u2019 nonviolent response to dogs, billy clubs and water cannons painted a necessary contrast for the North and the world: Here are the oppressors; there are the oppressed. Decades after the movement yielded the Civil Rights Act and now-gutted Voting Rights Act \u2013 and optics of raw violence play a smaller role in national discourse \u2013 does nonviolence remain viable? King\u2019s youngest daughter, Bernice, believes so. It\u2019s a slow road, but violence solves nothing, she said. \u201cIt creates further problems and leads to damage and destruction and further alienation,\u201d the minister and mediator said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have an ultimate goal. The seeds of destruction are contained within violence, so the only thing that results from it is more violence.\u201d The King Center, where she\u2019s CEO, has long imparted the philosophy, notably in South Africa, training voters ahead of its first multiracial election in 1994. Last month, honoring MLK Day, the center took its tutelage digital, offering a curriculum on the Nonviolence365 philosophy, her father\u2019s campaigns and his vision for the \u201cBeloved Community\u201d where poverty and hate have no hold. The class demonstrates how nonviolence can be harnessed in daily life, whether a neighborly or familial dispute, or a matter of equal pay or diversity at work. The center hopes to soon add a version geared to K-12 students. The tenets serve as the backbone of a planned march on Washington, spearheaded by a North Carolina minister who continues MLK\u2019s work of lifting the poor. They\u2019ve also inspired a Maryland bluesman to seek out conversations with neo-Nazis and Ku Klux Klansmen, one of whom says he now sees MLK\u2019s wisdom. While some point to the limitations of nonviolence, especially when people are defending themselves, Bernice King says it\u2019s the only path to real change. She reminds doubters of her father\u2019s quote, \u201cThe arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d The King Center provided CNN access to the class, which takes about 15 hours to complete. It dispels the misconception nonviolence is pacifism, as well as the misnomer that violence is physical. Cue Coretta Scott King, who founded the King Center in her basement in 1968. Days prior, just weeks after her husband was gunned down in Memphis, she addressed a crowd in the capital\u2019s Resurrection City. \u201cIn this society, violence against poor people and minority groups is routine. I remind you that starving a child is violence. Suppressing a culture is violence. Neglecting schoolchildren is violence. Punishing a mother and her child is violence. Discrimination against a working man is violence. Ghetto housing is violence. Ignoring medical needs is violence. Contempt of poverty is violence. Even the lack of willpower to help humanity is a sick and sinister form of violence,\u201d the widow said. Other examples include suppressing votes and inaction on police brutality or climate change, King Center instructors emphasize. Barring children from learning about Black history or slavery is violent. Systemic inequality is violence, they say. The Rev. William Barber is president of Repairers of the Breach, a nonprofit advancing an \u201cagenda that uplifts our deepest constitutional and moral values of love, justice and mercy.\u201d The pandemic made his mission more urgent, as the widening gap between haves and have nots exposes a \u201cscarcity of moral consciousness,\u201d he said. As lawmakers doled out tax cuts to corporations and the wealthy, they balked on a living wage and meaningfully stopping evictions, Barber said. They continued to fund a \u201cwar economy\u201d while Americans went hungry, he said. \u201cThose are the \u2018Bull\u2019 Connors of the day,\u201d Barber said. \u201cThis is not Jim Crow. It\u2019s James Crow, Esquire. \u2026 The moral crisis of this moment is our Jim Crow.\u201d While some might consider Coretta Scott King\u2019s quote a platitude, Barber says every example she gave is extreme violence. \u201cThey all have a death element in them,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople die when we don\u2019t pay people a living wage. People die when we deny healthcare. People die when we don\u2019t care for the climate.\u201d This isn\u2019t reverential pontification. A study shows an estimated 874,000 American deaths in 2000 were attributable to low education, racial segregation, low social support, individual poverty, income inequality and area poverty. One co-author \u2013 Boston University epidemiologist Dr. Sandro Galea \u2013 told CNN, \u201cI imagine that the estimates hold up reasonably well today.\u201d The King Center curriculum is broken into chunks and delivered from perspectives including activists, writers, scholars, clergy, former law enforcement, MLK lieutenant Andrew Young and Mary Liuzzo Lilleboe, whose mother was killed by the Ku Klux Klan in 1965. Instructors provide context for the philosophy\u2019s six principles, holding Kingian nonviolence: Martin Luther King Jr. was stabbed. His home was bombed. He received death threats and had a gun put to his head. He invariably responded with love. Bernice King\u2019s mother, too, exemplified nonviolence, whether in the household or how she treated people who violated her, the daughter said. Bernice led conferences on nonviolence in her late teens, but despite her mighty role models, she didn\u2019t make the \u201cintentional, focused commitment to nonviolence as a way of life\u201d until she became King Center CEO a decade ago. She struggles at times and isn\u2019t sure nonviolence can be perfected, she said. Like anything \u2013 say, weight loss \u2013 it\u2019s easier when you have like-minded people backing you. \u201cIf I might be frank, I have accountability people who are committed to this way as well. We hold each other accountable,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I get to those spaces and places when I forsake what I know is the right pathway, they\u2019ll check me \u2013 and I allow myself to be checked, more importantly.\u201d Nonviolence is the long game. Despite desegregating buses in Montgomery, Alabama, and lunch counters in Greensboro, North Carolina, Barber says the battle continues. \u201cYou have to have an eternal dissatisfaction with injustice. You have to have an eternal dissatisfaction with hate \u2013 to the point that I will engage in any way to change it, but that doesn\u2019t include me becoming the very thing I\u2019m trying to change,\u201d Barber said. \u201cThat\u2019s why you get up every morning working for justice, and what wakes you up is not your alarm clock but your purpose.\u201d There are no weigh stations in a movement. One never knows where they are in \u201cthe fight for justice and love and mercy,\u201d Barber said, but nonviolence isn\u2019t about instant gratification. Practitioners might not see the fruit of their toils, Bernice King added, but the next generation\u2019s inheritance must remain top of mind. \u201cIf I spent my entire time trying to be as violent or (exacting) as much violence as I can against those who\u2019ve been violent toward me, when I\u2019m gone what have I left my kids?\u201d she asked. MLK\u2019s philosophy often guides Daryl Davis. The musician, whose story the King Center offers as extracurricular study, grew up attending schools across the world. His first experience with racism came as a fourth-grader in 1968, as the only Black Cub Scout in a troop marching from Lexington to Concord, Massachusetts, to commemorate Paul Revere\u2019s \u201cMidnight Ride.\u201d Along the route, Davis was pelted with rocks, cans and other debris. Scout leaders shielded him and ferried him to safety but wouldn\u2019t explain what was happening. He thought the angry White spectators were anti-Cub Scout, he said, chuckling at his naivete. As his parents tended to his wounds, they dispelled the illusion, explaining racism. It was hard to believe for an embassy brat who got along swimmingly with his White friends in Massachusetts, just as he\u2019d gotten along with the Italian, Nigerian and Japanese kids at the schools abroad, he said. Weeks later, while watching \u201cBewitched,\u201d the show was interrupted with news of MLK\u2019s assassination. He\u2019d never heard of the man and went to his father\u2019s study to report what had happened. It was the first time he saw his dad cry. Thus began a fascination. Davis studied MLK\u2019s legacy and wrote letters to Coretta Scott King and James Earl Ray \u2013 and began seeking answers to questions raised on that parade route. \u201cI had formed a question in my mind at the age of 10, which was: How can you hate me when you don\u2019t even know me?\u201d he said. \u201cWho better to ask that question of than someone who would go so far as to join an organization that has well over a 100-year history of practicing hating people?\u201d Davis met his first Klansman in 1983 at a gig in Frederick, Maryland, and decided to become the first Black author to write a book about the Klan. Since 1991, Davis estimates, conversing with adversaries has helped convince about 60 Klansmen to hand over their robes and hoods, while others have given him patches, flags, armbands, belt buckles, \u201call kinds of crap.\u201d Davis never sought to convert anyone. He merely wanted answers, he said, but he saw bigots\u2019 tenors change when he broke down their fear and ignorance by demonstrating he understood that, like anyone, they wanted to be loved, respected, heard, treated fairly and to see their families thrive. \u201cA leopard does not change its spots. So, why would I think a Klansman would change his robe and hood? \u2026 All I wanted to know is why,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more we talked, the more I learned and the more they were learning, which I didn\u2019t realize, either. A takeaway from that was \u2013 and still is \u2013 that while you are actively learning about someone else, at the same time you are passively teaching about yourself.\u201d One of those Davis approached was Jeff Schoep, 48, who led the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement from 1994 to 2019. Schoep now runs Beyond Barriers USA, a nonprofit aiming to stamp out extremism. Schoep credits Davis and filmmaker Deeyah Khan with spurring him to re-examine his hatred. Schoep always viewed his bigotry as noble \u2013 he was defending \u201chis\u201d people and \u201cWhite civil rights\u201d \u2013 but speaking with Khan for her documentary, \u201cWhite Right: Meeting the Enemy,\u201d Schoep grew uncomfortable as the Muslim filmmaker recounted slurs she\u2019d faced growing up in Norway with an Afghan mother and Pakistani father. She had a \u201cvibrant energy,\u201d and he could feel her pain, Schoep recalled. Davis, Schoep said, opened their conversation with music and jokes. After they\u2019d built a rapport, Davis told Schoep the Cub Scout story, leading the then-neo-Nazi to think, \u201cWhat if someone had done that to one of my children, for any reason?\u201d Davis\u2019 tack is rooted in two Kingian principles: seeking understanding and defeating evil, not people. It was effective, Schoep explained, because \u201cas far as being in the movement, no one ever leaves that life by getting punched in the face.\u201d MLK had a dream that one day \u201con the red hills of Georgia\u201d the sons of slaves and slave owners would sit down together. Davis believes he\u2019s doing his part, he said. \u201cI am the descendant of slaves and I, as a Black man, am sitting down with the descendants of slave owners, who come in the form of modern-day White supremacists, \u2018at the table of brotherhood,\u2019\u201d he said. Davis has limits, though. While he resists violence, he has hospitalized Klansmen who attacked him, he said. Asked why he departed from the principles, he said he simply didn\u2019t want to be injured. As great as King was, he wasn\u2019t walking into Klan rallies, Davis noted. Johnetta Elzie, too, has doubts. The Missouri native cut her teeth in activism after the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown not far from her childhood home. She was a prominent figure in Baltimore\u2019s Freddie Gray protests the following year. The organizer and writer demonstrates acumen in several of King\u2019s steps to nonviolence \u2013 including information gathering, education, personal commitment and direct action \u2013 but when people ask about fits of violence among protesters, she replies: \u201cIs that a realistic question?\u201d In Ferguson and Baltimore, there were phalanxes of police with batons and shields, pointing automatic weapons at women, journalists and young people, Elzie said. They were backed by soldiers and armored vehicles (and in Ferguson, by armed Oath Keepers, members of which now stand charged in the January 6 insurrection). \u201cWhat\u2019s the threshold of violence, and how do you look at Black people doing anything in response to state violence and cry about that, but the state violence itself doesn\u2019t bother you?\u201d she asked. \u201cAre you offended by this? Because if so, we can have a conversation. If not, we have nothing to talk about.\u201d People have been skeptical of nonviolence since MLK\u2019s day \u2013 look no further than Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X \u2013 and while Elzie knows older activists and clergy who follow that path, she doesn\u2019t encounter many people \u201cgrowing up in the current climate\u201d inclined to do the same. Ditch the binaries, she said. There\u2019s space between the poles to \u201cdisagree on points and ways of living,\u201d she said. \u201cI personally am not going out to be violent with other people, but I\u2019m also not about to purposely go out of my way to condemn anyone on my side for choosing to do so in reaction to state violence,\u201d she said. \u201cKey word: reaction.\u201d Bernice King understands the mentality, and she knows there are people \u2013 even police \u2013 \u201chellbent\u201d on destroying African Americans, but, she points out, even the conscience of the most virulent racist \u201ccan be awakened.\u201d \u201cPart of the biggest challenge,\u201d she said, \u201cis it\u2019s hard to take on law enforcement in the streets. It\u2019s a losing battle. It just is.\u201d She concurs, however, the media and others need to call out state violence with the same vigor they employ decrying reactions to violence, she said. \u201cThat\u2019s what daddy called out. He said, \u2018I can\u2019t condemn those rioting and not at the same time condemn my very nation, who\u2019s the greatest purveyor of violence,\u2019\u201d she said. Protests today feel disconnected, Bernice King said, more reactionary than proactive. When Rosa Parks was arrested, protesters didn\u2019t target Alabama\u2019s capital; they boycotted the bus system enforcing segregation. Further, as the Nonviolence365 course teaches, campaigns fed off each other. Failures in 1961\u2019s Albany Movement in Georgia informed successes in Birmingham and Selma, Alabama, which led to greater victories, including the Civil Rights Act of 1968, following Operation Breadbasket and the Chicago Freedom Movement. The Rev. Barber embraces the Kingian principle that unearned suffering can be redemptive. One must be willing to suffer for the cause. Barber experiences intense back pain, he said, but \u201cpeople suffering without a living wage \u2013 they hurt worse than I do.\u201d Barber\u2019s led many marches and been arrested at least 15 times. He\u2019s willing to be taken into custody again, he said, during the June 18 Mass Poor People\u2019s and Low-Wage Workers\u2019 Assembly and Moral March on Washington and to the Polls. Likening the march to King\u2019s Birmingham campaign in 1963, Barber said people are ready to fill the jails to make their point. About 1,000 protesters were arrested in Birmingham, including King, who spent eight days in jail. \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is: Whatever is going on is so bad that it\u2019s worth engaging in, quote on quote, breaking the law because policies are being used to break people\u2019s lives,\u201d he said. \u201cIf putting your body on the line will dramatize how bad it is and get attention to that matter, then you\u2019re willing to do that because we\u2019re not an insurrection. We\u2019re a resurrection \u2013 a resurrection of morals.\u201d Where MLK spoke of the \u201ctriple evils\u201d of racism, economic exploitation and militarism, Barber has expanded that to the \u201cinterlocking injustices of systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, denial of healthcare, the war economy and the false moral narrative of religious nationalism and white supremacy.\u201d That 140 million people \u2013 more than 40% of Americans \u2013 are poor or draw low incomes is unacceptable in a country so wealthy, he said. March organizers are putting people of all backgrounds in front of cameras to demonstrate who\u2019s being impacted. This isn\u2019t about race. After the Selma to Montgomery marches, Barber said, King did not proclaim a victory for Black people. \u201cHe actually said that the systems of segregation and voter suppression were stratagems \u2026 that were used by the Southern aristocracy to keep the masses of poor Negro voters and White voters from coming together and forming a political power base that could shift the economic architecture of the country,\u201d Barber said. \u201cToo often today, our leaders are not talking like that.\u201d There\u2019s too much bifurcation, he said. MLK presented the links between evils. Today, King would\u2019ve connected rising poverty with bills aimed at suppressing votes after an election boasting record turnout, Barber suspects. It\u2019s unsurprising that Barber and Bernice King \u2013 both people of the cloth \u2013 say the nonviolent mindset requires faith, but even those who are more spiritual than religious (or agnostic or atheist) must believe in the possibility of better days. Bernice King alluded to John Lewis, who did not know, as a 25-year-old organizer in Selma, he\u2019d have his skull cracked and face death threats before becoming a 17-term congressman. He didn\u2019t know many of the voting rights for which he fought would be snatched away by the US Supreme Court \u2013 or that after his death, fellow legislators would work to restore those rights in his name. Still, he fought for most of his 80 years. \u201cIt\u2019s also knowing you are part of a force that will ultimately bring about transformation. You have to believe that. If you don\u2019t enter into it with that mindset, then you\u2019re always going to be in a never-ending cycle of violence and chaos,\u201d Bernice King said. \u201cAre you really committed to this outcome to the point that even if you don\u2019t see it in your lifetime \u2013 even as my father didn\u2019t see some of these things in his lifetime \u2013 it\u2019s OK as long as I know what I\u2019m doing is going to lead to an outcome for another generation?\u201d",

            "article_content": "The podcaster Joe Rogan did not join a mob that forced lawmakers to flee for their lives. He never carried a Confederate flag inside the US Capitol rotunda. No one died trying to stop him from using the n-word. But what Rogan and those that defend him have done since video clips of him using the n-word surfaced on social media is arguably just as dangerous as what a mob did when they stormed the US Capitol on January 6 last year. Rogan breached a civic norm that has held America together since World War II. It\u2019s an unspoken agreement that we would never return to the kind of country we used to be. That agreement revolved around this simple rule: A White person would never be able to publicly use the n-word again and not pay a price. Rogan has so far paid no steep professional price for using a racial slur that\u2019s been called the \u201cnuclear bomb of racial epithets.\u201d It may even boost his career. That\u2019s what some say happened to another White entertainer who was recently caught using the word. It is a sign of how desensitized we have become to the rising levels of violence \u2013 rhetorical and physical \u2013 in our country that Rogan\u2019s slurs were largely treated as the latest racial outrage of the week. But once we allow a White public figure to repeatedly use the foulest racial epithet in the English language without experiencing any form of punishment, we become a different country. We accept the mainstreaming of a form of political violence that\u2019s as dangerous as the January 6 attack. Some might say that comparing a podcaster\u2019s moronic musings about race to January 6 is hyperbole. They will invoke \u201ccancel culture\u201d and political correctness. The man apologized, they will say. And he did. \u200bHe called his comments \u201cthe most regretful and shameful thing,\u201d adding \u201cI know that to most people, there\u2019s no context where a White person is ever allowed to say that word, never mind publicly on a podcast, and I agree with that,\u201d Rogan said after a video showed him using the n-word more than 20 times in different podcast episodes. Rogan has also apologized for a video of him comparing a gathering of Black people to \u201cPlanet of the Apes.\u201d He has said he is \u201cnot racist.\u201d In the past, White public figures who used the n-word provoked universal and unqualified condemnation. But Rogan has gotten some support. His comments drew criticism from Daniel Ek, chief executive of Spotify, which reportedly pays Rogan at least $100 million to carry his mega-popular podcast. Ek said Rogan\u2019s racial slurs \u201cdo not represent the values of this company.\u201d But Ek also said Spotify will continue to stand by Rogan, who had the most popular podcast on the streaming platform last year. \u201cWe should have clear lines around content and take action when they are crossed, but canceling voices is a slippery slope,\u201d Ek said in a memo to his staff. Another media mogul offered Rogan a lucrative new gig.  The chief executive of another social media company offered Rogan $100 million to bring his podcast to its platform, citing Rogan\u2019s \u201clegion of fans in desire for real conversation.\u201d And former President Donald Trump told Rogan he should \u201cstop apologizing\u201d for his controversies \u2013 including the racial slurs and spreading Covid-19 misinformation \u2013 because he shouldn\u2019t allow critics to make him \u201clook weak and frightened.\u201d Rogan\u2019s use of the n-word could even boost his career if it follows the trajectory of another White entertainer, country music star Morgan Wallen. Wallen\u2019s career seemed finished a year ago after he was caught on video using the n-word in a conversation with a friend. Radio stations and streaming services dropped him from their playlists. The Academy of Country Music declared him ineligible for the 2021 ACM Awards. Wallen apologized but was widely condemned. A year later, \u201cWallen\u2019s career has \u200bnot only rebounded but exploded,\u201d  according to Billboard magazine. His songs are back on the radio and he had the most popular album of 2021 in the US, according to Billboard. Wallen is embarking on a nationwide tour, with many dates already sold out, and is slated to headline music festivals this summer. Rolling Stone published an article earlier this month with the headline: \u201cDid Dropping the N-Word Actually Help Morgan Wallen\u2019s Career?\u201d  The article quoted a Nashville industry insider who said Wallen\u2019s popularity surged after his use of the n-word because the backlash \u201cmade him a martyr\u2026 to people that hold what I would say are prejudices.\u201d A recent USA Today story said Wallen has become an \u201canti-cancel culture hero\u201d and quoted an executive  who said that the more the mainstream criticizes Wallen \u201cthe more power those who support his bigotry begin to feel.\u201d Meanwhile, Rogan is now reframing the backlash over his use of the n-word as a cancel culture battle. \u201cThis is a \u201cpolitical hit job,\u201d he recently said, suggesting that the controversy may actually help him. \u201cIt\u2019s good because it makes me address some (expletive) that I really wish wasn\u2019t out there,\u201d he told a guest on his show Tuesday. \u200b\u201dYou just have to stay offline \u2026 Life goes on as normal.\u201d For decades, life would never go on as normal for a White person caught using the n-word. This represents a momentous shift in American culture. There used to be a consensus that any White person caught using the n-word or other racial slurs would pay a hefty price. Not that long ago, many did. In 2018, the actress Roseanne Barr had her popular sitcom canceled after she made a series of racist tweets. That same year, a top executive resigned from Netflix after using the N-word in front of Black employees. Celebrity chef Paula Deen lost her business empire and saw her cooking shows canceled by the Food Network in 2013 after she admitted using the n-word during a deposition in a lawsuit. And the career of \u201cSeinfeld\u2019s\u201d Michael Richards cratered after he was caught calling hecklers the n-word in 2006. The price that White people paid for crossing this line wasn\u2019t legal. No one called for them to be jailed or fined.  But many were shamed and exiled from their professional communities. The prohibition against White people using racist language in public was so severe that a person could see their career destroyed even if they used a racial slur that most people didn\u2019t comprehend. George Allen was a popular US senator who seemed to be cruising to re-election in Virginia in 2006 when he was filmed\u200b using the word \u201cmacaca,\u201d a type of monkey,\u201d to describe an Indian-American volunteer with the campaign of his opponent. He lost his re-election bid after both Republicans and Democrats criticized him. His political career never recovered. Using the n-word became a rhetorical red line because it represents arguably the most shameful part of US history: slavery and the Jim Crow era. Neal Lester, an Arizona State University English professor who has taught a course on the n-word, noted it has been described as \u201cthe most toxic in the English language,\u201d a term \u201calmost magical in its negative power,\u201d and a slur that \u201coccupies a place in the soul where logic and reason never go.\u201d \u201cThe word is inextricably linked with violence and brutality on Black psyches and derogatory aspersions cast on Black bodies,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cNo degree of appropriating can rid it of that blood-soaked history.\u201d It took a lot of work to ban the n-word from the public square. That shift wasn\u2019t about political correctness. It was about our survival as a multiracial democracy and our standing in the world. The n-word became forbidden in the US public sphere around the mid-20th century when a consensus emerged that \u201cpublic racism\u201d was sabotaging democracy, some academics say. But in the decades before that, White entertainers and politicians talked like Rogan all the time. World War II helped change that. The war against Nazism and revelations about the Holocaust raised awareness of racism, while  America\u2019s new role as a leader of the \u201cfree world\u201d caused White elites to see racism as the nation\u2019s Achilles heel, wrote Robert L. Fleegler, a history professor at the University of Mississippi, in a paper titled, \u201cTheodore G. Bilbo and the Decline of Public Racism, 1938-1947.\u201d Bilbo, a US Senator from Mississippi, felt free enough to tell White supporters during an election campaign in 1946 that \u201cI call on every red-blooded White man to use any means to keep the  n***ers away from the polls.\u201d Bilbo won the Democratic primary and faced no opposition in the general election, but his Senate colleagues barred him from taking his seat in the chamber because of his open racism. In the years that followed, Southern White politicians still used racially coded words like \u201cstate\u2019s rights,\u201d but most avoided using the n-word in public, Fleegler wrote. The civil rights movement also created a stigma around Whites using the n-word and other racial slurs. The assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the eruption of race riots after King\u2019s death showed White Americans what could happen when a group of citizens were treated with systemic disregard for their humanity.  \u200b Using the n-word came to be seen as a vulgar relic of a shameful past, said Jacob Levy, a scholar and author of an essay titled \u201cThe Weight of the Words.\u201d \u201cThe norm against publicly legitimizing Klan-type racism was built up over a long time,\u201d Levy wrote, \u201ccalling on white Americans to do better than they were, partly by convincing them that they were better.\u201d Why the change now? The theories vary. Some cite the rise of social media, the growth of White supremacist groups and a right-wing media ecosystem that has mainstreamed racist rhetoric. Former President Trump played a part, too. He rode a trail of racist, sexist, and antisemitic  statements all the way to the White House. All these factors converged to create a chain effect that led to what one scholar calls \u201cdefining deviance down.\u201d That\u2019s what happens when a country starts accepting offensive language it rejected before, wrote Steven Levitsky, co-author of the book, \u201cHow Democracies Die.\u201d \u201cWhen unwritten rules are violated over and over, we become overwhelmed \u2013 and then desensitized,\u201d Levitsky wrote. \u201cWe grow accustomed to what we previously thought to be scandalous.\u201d Something else happens that\u2019s even more deadly. When people in positions of power use dehumanizing language to describe other groups, atrocities often follow. This is not ancient history: Consider what happened less than 30 years ago in Rwanda when some 800,000 civilians were slaughtered in a three-month period in 1994. Hutu extremists targeted both the Tutsi minority, who were a majority of those killed, as well as moderate Hutus. What triggered the violence in part were the messages that came from people in positions of power in Rwanda. Many, like Rogan, had a public megaphone and an audience. In a New Yorker essay on \u201cHow Norms Change,\u201d the author Maria Konnikova described how Hutu leaders took to the radio calling Tutsis \u201ccockroaches,\u201d sanctioning the violence that followed. She said that \u201cnorms can shift at the speed of social life\u201d when the wrong leaders command the public\u2019s attention. \u201cTo a great extent, the norms in Rwanda shifted so rapidly because they did so from the top: Influential radio stations broadcast a powerful, persuasive and constantly repeating message urging listeners to join killing squads and organize roadblocks,\u201d Konnikova wrote. \u200b Genocide is a worst-case scenario. But we don\u2019t have to look as far as Rwanda to see how quickly civic norms can change when people in power start lowering standards. Earlier this month the Republican National Committee drafted a resolution calling the deadly January 6 insurrection \u201clegitimate political discourse.\u201d CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson responded in a column, \u201cThe Republican Party is ever closer to the destination to which it has long been headed under former President Donald Trump \u2013 the legitimization of violence as a form of political expression.\u201d Rogan\u2019s use of the n-word may also be drawing us closer to something else: destroying any plausible shot at building a genuine multiracial democracy. The January 6 insurrection was so dangerous because it violated a political norm. The citizens in a healthy democracy are supposed to accept the peaceful transfer of power, not to use violence as a tool of political protest. That\u2019s what most Americans agreed to leave behind after we fought a bloody Civil War over a political and moral issue: slavery. The universal condemnation that used to greet White people who publicly used the n-word was also part of a civic norm that made a multiracial democracy possible. That word was a vestige of a hateful Jim Crow era that most Americans agreed to leave in the past. It was considered un-American. This is the America that former President Ronald \u200bReagan evoked in his famous \u201cshining city on a hill\u201d 1989 farewell address. He described us as a nation \u201cteeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace,\u201d with doors \u201copen to anyone with the will and heart to get here.\u201d What are we now? What are we when a White entertainer with a huge public following can use the n-word repeatedly \u2013 and get a $100 million offer to bring \u201creal conversation\u201d to another platform? What are we when Rogan\u2019s employer can say that his company has \u201cclear lines around content and take action when they are crossed,\u201d but that line doesn\u2019t include using a word that was used during the enslavement, rape and torture of millions of people. Rogan once called himself a \u201cf\u2014ing moron\u2026 a cage-fighting commentator\u201d and not a \u201crespected source of information, even for me.\u201d He is something more now. He is unleashing lethal forces that he may not understand. He is also a blinking red light, warning that the civic and political rules that once held the nation together no longer apply. We are poised to enter an era where a White person can use the n-word publicly and not only survive but thrive if they portray themselves as a victim of cancel culture. It\u2019s a world where hate speech and violence are rebranded as \u201clegitimate political discourse,\u201d and \u201cpublic racism\u201d returns to ordinary life. Don\u2019t let the Rogan n-word controversy devolve into another tired discussion about cancel culture. This moment is bigger. If Rogan goes on with business as usual, all of us \u2013 not just Black people \u2013 will pay a price. Our country won\u2019t be the same. This is another January 6 moment.",

            "article_content": "A community in Northwest Harris County woke up Sunday morning to White supremacist flyers on their car windshields and even on the front doors of their homes, according to William White, director of operations at the Houston chapter of Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR). \u201cThis is horrifying,\u201d White told CNN by phone. The title of the flyer is, \u201c2026: A Race Odyssey.\u201d It goes on to say, \u201cThink about it! At the current rate of decline, what will America\u2019s major cities look like in ten years?\u201d The center of the flyer has a racist caricature depicting African Americans in negative racial stereotypes. The flyer then provides a web address for recipients to follow. CNN is choosing not to show the flyers because they are racist and offensive in nature. \u201cI do believe that this is about voter intimidation,\u201d White said. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for that in the city.\u201d Flyers with anti-Semitic language distributed in neighborhoods across South Florida; also reported in 5 other states February is Black History month and the next election, the primary, in Harris County is March 1, with early voting starting next Monday. White says he is not disclosing the name of the impacted neighborhood for safety reasons, but says the community is very diverse. At least four residents received the flyers, per White, but he says some people might be afraid to come forward and report the act. And none of the residents, he says, are willing to talk to reporters; but one of them called his office to report the incident. CAIR Houston is investigating and hoping that home security cameras captured the perpetrators in the act of distributing the flyers. White says he is working to gather more evidence to present to Harris County law enforcement and the FBI. And he hopes elected officials denounce the racist act. In an email to CNN, the Harris County Sheriff\u2019s Office said deputies took an incident report from one resident, which would be forwarded to the office\u2019s Homeland Security Bureau for further investigation. The FBI is not confirming or denying an investigation is underway into this incident, but sent CNN the following statement: \u201cThe FBI Houston Field Office is aware of the incident involving the distribution of white supremacist flyers in a Northwest Harris County neighborhood and we are in regular contact with local authorities. FBI policy prohibits confirming or denying an investigation. However, if during the local investigation, information becomes known of a potential federal civil rights violation, the FBI is prepared to investigate,\u201d said the FBI Houston Field Office statement to CNN. \u201cThe FBI is the lead investigative agency for criminal violations of federal civil rights statutes. In October 2021, FBI Houston launched our participation in a nationwide initiative that encourages the public to report allegations of hate crime to law enforcement,\u201d the FBI statement went on to say. Beverly Hills police say they're investigating anti-Semitic flyers distributed one night before the beginning of Hanukkah This appears to be at least the second time the group targeted a neighborhood with White supremacist flyers in the Houston area. Last November, Telemundo Houston, a Spanish language network, reported that racist flyers, with the group\u2019s logo, targeted a neighborhood of immigrants. Those flyers were titled: \u201cWake up, White America!\u201d \u201cWe are concerned about a recent flurry of extremist propaganda distributions in ADL\u2019s Southwest Region. The racist flyers found recently in northwest Harris County are particularly vile and disgusting and it is understandable people who found them in their yards would be outraged and upset,\u201d said ADL Southwest Regional Director Mark B. Toubin in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe applaud the good people who recognize the message in the flyers is hateful and wrong. The flyers are designed to attract attention to the individuals and organizations who disseminate them, and we appreciate those who reject the flyers and the disturbing message they contain.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kacey Cherry contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby once said city prosecutors had \u201cthe toughest job in America,\u201d a job made increasingly difficult when delivering justice means overhauling a system many feel is broken. Since taking the helm at the city prosecutor\u2019s office in 2015, just months before Freddie Gray died from spinal injuries he suffered in the back of a police van, Mosby has preached reform while hopping from one firestorm to the next, it seems. Now, amid her second reelection campaign and months before the June primary, she faces criminal charges her attorney says are politically and racially driven. A federal grand jury indicted Baltimore\u2019s top prosecutor this week on two counts of perjury and two counts of making false statements on loan applications for two Florida vacation homes, according to court documents. Mosby, the indictment alleges, applied for loans against her retirement account, allegedly tapping a CARES Act provision for those hurt financially by the Covid-19 pandemic. Baltimore state's attorney Marilyn Mosby indicted on charges of perjury and making false statements on mortgage applications Mosby indicated she had suffered \u201cadverse financial consequences,\u201d despite her quarter-million-dollar 2020 salary, and failed to disclose she owed $45,000 in federal back taxes, according to the indictment. She also allegedly said she would be the primary resident at one of the homes in order to secure a lower rate when she had already entered into an agreement with a rental management firm, the indictment says. She sold one of the homes for a $150,000 profit, The Baltimore Sun reported. A spokeswoman for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office and Mosby\u2019s attorney did not immediately respond to an interview request. The spokeswoman sent a statement to CNN affiliate WBAL saying prosecutors \u201cwill not be distracted or sidetracked from our mission to make Baltimore a safer community.\u201d Attorney A. Scott Bolden issued a statement calling the charges \u201cbogus\u201d and his client innocent. Mosby never lied in relation to the allegations, the statement said, and the US Attorney\u2019s Office for Maryland refused requests to meet with Bolden\u2019s team and to inform Bolden if \u201cevidence of Ms. Mosby\u2019s innocence that we provided \u2026 was ever presented to the grand jury.\u201d The statement further accused the federal prosecutor of conspiring with the Justice Department\u2019s tax division to \u201cwrongfully indict\u201d his client, and alleged federal law enforcement offices were interested only in \u201cbringing false charges against my client \u2013 at all or any costs.\u201d The charges \u201care rooted in personal, political and racial animus five months from her election,\u201d Bolden wrote. US Attorney Erek Barron, who like Mosby is African American, declined to comment, saying through a spokeswoman the indictment speaks for itself. In a Friday afternoon news conference, Mosby declined to take questions, saying Bolden would address the media later, but she insisted she\u2019s being targeted politically and vowed to fight as she\u2019s done throughout her tenure. Before becoming state\u2019s attorney, Mosby graduated from Tuskegee University and Boston College Law School. During her studies at the latter, the Boston native worked in her hometown Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s Office and in two US attorneys\u2019 offices. After graduation, she prosecuted felonies in the Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office from 2006 to 2011 before entering the corporate realm as a civil litigator. She decided in the summer of 2013 to run for the Baltimore state\u2019s attorney post. She won and took office in January 2015. On April 12, 2015, Gray was arrested, and video showing the 25-year-old screaming as officers dragged him to a police van sparked questions. Outrage ensued when Gray died a week later, and the city was consumed with protests, some of which were hijacked by looters and rioters. Enter Mosby, who was hailed as a hero and inspiration when, less than two weeks after Gray was killed, she charged six Baltimore police officers with misconduct along with assault, manslaughter or murder counts in the young man\u2019s death. The glow quickly faded. As the police union accused her of rushing to judgment and the charged officers asked a court to remove her from the case because of alleged conflicts of interest, which she denied, she appeared on stage at a Prince concert. She did not offer remarks, but critics questioned the propriety of appearing at the Rally4Peace, a concert held in response to Baltimore\u2019s unrest, in which attendees were urged to wear gray, as the now-deceased rock icon himself wore. Even attorney Laura Coates, now a CNN legal analyst, who had initially applauded Mosby, tweeted \u201cTsk tsk\u201d following the Prince appearance and noted Mosby was facing allegations of conflicts of interest and charging officers as a publicity stunt. \u201cThink b4 u act,\u201d Coates tweeted. While Gray\u2019s death served as a rallying point for those decrying police brutality, none of the officers was convicted, despite the city paying Gray\u2019s family $6.4 million. Three were tried and acquitted, prompting Mosby to drop charges against the remaining three because of the \u201cdismal likelihood\u201d they\u2019d be convicted. Within weeks, five of the officers sued Mosby, alleging false arrest, defamation and other misdeeds. A federal appeals court ruled Mosby had immunity, and the US Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal, WBAL reported. Despite her \u201cagonizing\u201d decision to drop charges in the Gray killing, Mosby continued working to stamp out \u201centrenched police corruption\u201d in the city of 586,000, she said. In an interview last year, she boasted that, despite the officers\u2019 acquittals and vacated charges, \u201cevery single police officer is now being held accountable for the actions of a few.\u201d Following a federal probe that found the Baltimore Police Department had engaged in a pattern of excessive force, racially biased arrests and other constitutional violations, the department underwent a \u201ctotal makeover,\u201d Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said last year. That included a \u201crobust\u201d use-of-force policy, emphasis on de-escalation and sanctity of life and revised policies on traffic stops, searches and arrests, along with other approaches aimed at improving community policing, he said. Officers were using less force and facing fewer complaints, and many agencies regarded BPD as a model, Harrison said, adding the city was \u201cturning the corner\u201d but had a long way to go. Authorities would find themselves more frequently in prosecutors\u2019 crosshairs over the ensuing years: \u2022 July 2017: After body camera footage showed an officer planting evidence, Mosby\u2019s office announced a review of about 100 cases investigated by three officers. Her office later dismissed 34 of the cases. \u2022 December 2017: A public defender said the arrests of eight Baltimore officers on racketeering charges cast into doubt the integrity of more than 2,000 criminal cases. Mosby said a comprehensive review of the cases was integral to restoring public trust. \u2022 October 2019: Several months after Mosby said she would no longer prosecute marijuana possession, she announced almost 800 cases \u2013 involving 25 officers suspected of corruption \u2013 would be thrown out. \u2022 November 2019: Mosby was part of a successful effort to release three men wrongfully convicted in a 1983 murder and denounced the \u201cintentional concealment and misrepresentation of the exculpatory evidence\u201d in the case. \u2022 December 2019: Mosby announced indictments against 25 city corrections officers on allegations of excessive force and intimidating inmates, saying, \u201cIf you break the law and you break the trust the public has placed within you, you will face the consequences.\u201d \u2022 In March, she took her stance on marijuana possession a step further, announcing her office would no longer prosecute any drug possession. Her office would also decline to prosecute prostitution and other low-level offenses, she said. \u2022 In July, her office secured indictments against two Baltimore officers accused of assaulting and threatening to kill a teenager during a car theft investigation. \u2022 In November, a judge granted her office\u2019s request to vacate a conviction against David Morris, who spent 17 years in prison for murder. Alleging police and prosecutorial misconduct in the case, Mosby heralded the decision, saying, \u201cThis case exemplifies the deeply damaging nature of the historical failures of the criminal justice system and our duty as prosecutors to address the wrongs of the past.\u201d In her Friday news conference, Mosby drew links between the federal charges and her work to \u201cbridge the divide between the criminal justice system and the communities that we are trusted to serve.\u201d At times speaking over the din of city traffic, she told reporters that she has sought only to make communities safer while improving the justice system. She expected the job would be hard, she said, but she did not expect the personal attacks, nor did she expect to be mocked and ridiculed, she said. \u201cI also need citizens, who I am blessed to serve, to know that I am innocent of the charges that have been (leveled) against me, and I intend to fight with every ounce of energy within my being to prove my innocence,\u201d she said. She cited sacrifices she made, including missing her two daughters\u2019 games and recitals, fending off investigations and having to \u201cincessantly fight\u201d to keep her law license. She\u2019s spent a half-million dollars defending herself against \u201cfrivolous attacks,\u201d she said. Mosby\u2019s also received hate mail and death threats, she said, and the media has compromised her daughters\u2019 safety. She now requires 24-hour security, she said. Meanwhile, she has been forced to battle powerful institutions, the prosecutor said, pointing to a laundry list of enemies that includes the US attorney\u2019s office, the Fraternal Order of Police, right-wing media, Gov. Larry Hogan and former President Donald Trump. Since the Gray case, \u201cI have had a target on my back, and I get it,\u201d she said. Touting her record, she says she\u2019s fought for a uniform standard of justice for all Baltimore residents, prosecuted police for violating rights, sought to \u201cend the war on drug users and people of color,\u201d decriminalized drug possession and sex work, demanded second chances for incarcerated lifers and helped exonerate Black men who the \u201cjustice system wanted to rot in prison.\u201d \u201cI get it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not what prosecutors usually do and many people will forever hate me for it.\u201d While debating ideology is democracy at work, she said, the charges against her are the product of \u201cunreasonable and unyielding, abusive attacks, investigation and prosecution.\u201d She did not defraud anyone and did not lie on a mortgage application, she said, reiterating her attorney\u2019s assertion that she offered to provide exculpatory information to federal prosecutors. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be fooled. We are now five months from our next election and this indictment is merely a political ploy by my political adversaries to unseat me,\u201d Mosby told reporters. \u201cPlease also understand that I will never let that happen without a fight.\u201d CNN\u2019s Laura Dolan, Ray Sanchez, Laura Studley, Mallika Kallingal, Emma Tucker and Jean Casarez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. has been called a socialist, a Republican, an \u201cangry Black man\u201d and a \u201cteddy bear.\u201d It\u2019s an annual ritual on the birthday of the iconic civil rights leader: Pundits offer provocative interpretations of King to make him relevant for a contemporary audience. But these commentators won\u2019t have to work as hard this year to explain why King matters. Anyone who wants to remind Americans about the urgency of King\u2019s message can now cite January 6, 2021. That\u2019s when supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol and tried to block Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 presidential election because they wrongly believed Trump had won. January 6 and January 15: These dueling dates are just nine days apart, yet they offer two radically different visions of what the US stands for. For part of America, January 6 is a \u201c1776 moment,\u201d a great patriotic uprising. Another part of the country celebrates King\u2019s January 15 birthday and his dream of a Beloved Community \u2013 a \u201cworld in which people of all identities are equal and included.\u201d The two dates present the country with a choice: Are we going to be a nation of We, the People, or We, the White people? The question may seem abstract, but if you look closer at what both men did with their defining moments in Washington, the differences are clear. Consider the contrasts between King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream Speech\u201d on August 28, 1963, at the Lincoln Memorial and Trump\u2019s January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally at the Ellipse. King drew a peaceful, interracial crowd to Washington and talked about a dream that united \u201call of God\u2019s children \u2013 Black men and White men, Jews and Gentiles, Catholics and Protestants\u2026\u201d Trump drew an overwhelmingly White crowd that included members of White supremacist groups, a man wearing a \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d T-shirt and people who erected a lynching noose on the Capitol grounds. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech helped spark the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which helped make the US a genuine democracy for the first time. Trump\u2019s speech directly preceded an attack on Congress that killed five people and injured many others and prompted a wave of voter suppression laws that have weakened American democracy. King drew a cross-section of religious leaders, activists and celebrities like singer Joan Baez, future congressman John Lewis, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier and Charlton Heston. Trump drew \u201cQAnon Shaman\u201d Jacob Chansley, a man who paraded a Confederate Flag through the Capitol and others who smeared poop in the building\u2019s hallways. One crowd inspired the country. Another debased the US Capitol. King had a dream. Trump had a mob. The January 6 marker may help revitalize interest in King\u2019s holiday in another way. More people might pay attention to an under-appreciated aspect of King\u2019s legacy: His passionate defense of democracy. Our system of government could use some inspired defenders right now. President Biden called this month for the passage of new voting rights legislation that would make it harder to steal elections. But a wall of Republican opposition and at least two Democratic senators who reject any filibuster reform has for now doomed that bill. King lived in an era where the filibuster was routinely used to deny Black equality. NAACP leaders once fumed that the filibuster was the legislative equivalent of a lynching. King offers voting rights advocates today a model for explaining why voter suppression laws betray democracy. \u201cSo long as I do not firmly and irrevocably possess the right to vote I do not possess myself. I cannot make up my mind\u2014it is made up for me. I cannot live as a democratic citizen, observing the laws I have helped to enact\u2014I can only submit to the edict of others,\u201d he said in a 1957 speech titled, \u201cGive us the Ballot and We Will Transform the South.\u201d That King speech wasn\u2019t considered revolutionary at the time. But January 6 now makes King\u2019s belief in democracy seem, well, radical. Most Americans no longer consider their country to be a beacon of democracy to the world. A recent Pew Research Center poll revealed this stat: 72% of Americans say the US used to be a good model of democracy for other countries to follow but has not been in recent years. Many Americans believe the Big Lie that the 2020 presidential election, which had record turnout, was stolen. About half of Republicans describe the Capitol mob\u2019s actions as \u201cpatriotism\u201d or \u201cdefending freedom.\u201d Authoritarian governments in China, Russia and Brazil are on the rise, and democracy is in retreat around the globe. How can Americans lecture other countries about democracy when so many of its own citizens no longer believe in it? That\u2019s why King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech is more important than ever. You won\u2019t find a more eloquent defense of multiracial democracy anywhere. It is widely considered the greatest political speech of the 20th Century because, in part, it is profoundly unoriginal. King was like a master DJ \u2013 mixing and sampling all of the nation\u2019s founding documents to create something new. He quotes or alludes to The Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the Gettysburg Address. He ended the speech by evoking an African American spiritual. He turned a political rally into a church revival for democracy. \u201cWe consistently marginalize or ignore Dr. King\u2019s commitment to the core values of democracy,\u201d Taylor Branch, the Pulitzer Prize winning author of \u201cParting the Waters,\u201d said. \u201cHe planted one foot in American heritage, the other in scripture, and both in nonviolence.\u201d Here\u2019s another part of King\u2019s vision that now seems radical after January 6: His belief in racial integration. His \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech reflected his belief that perpetual racial conflict didn\u2019t have to be his country\u2019s destiny. His hope is reflected in one of the most famous lines from the speech: \u201cI have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, sons of former slaves and sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.\u201d Almost 60 years later, that table of brotherhood is still waiting for more diners to pull up a seat. The country\u2019s public schools, neighborhoods and communities of worship remain largely racially segregated. When was the last time you heard any political or civil rights leader talk with passion about racial integration? The reasons for this are complex, but it boils down to this: There are never enough White Americans \u2013 including progressive White people - who are willing to embrace integration when it comes to accepting nonwhite people in their backyards. President Lyndon Johnson, a contemporary of King\u2019s, had a word for what many Americans will experience if they remain segregated. He said the country would suffer an \u201cunraveling.\u201d The violence of January 6 seemed like a snapshot of that unraveling. Has the news ever before felt so grim? America has more guns than ever, pundits warn about an impending civil war and polls show a growing number of Americans say \u201cpolitical violence\u201d is justified. King knew what it was like to live in a country where violence and racial antagonism seemed ineradicable. Even so, he still declared that the \u201carc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\u201d \u201cI refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history,\u201d he said in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech a year after the March on Washington. \u201cI believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality. This is why right, temporarily defeated, is stronger than evil triumphant.\u201d Those are words that lift the soul. How much will they mean, though, if the US becomes a performative democracy \u2013 a country with the veneer of fair elections but run by White minority rule. If that happens, January 6 \u2013 not January 15 \u2013 will be a truer reflection of what the US stands for. And what King said in 1963 will no longer be a dream. It\u2019ll be a mirage.",

            "article_content": "The chief prosecutor for the city of Baltimore has been indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of perjury and two counts of making false statements on loan applications for the purchase of two vacation homes in Florida, according to court documents filed Thursday. State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who gained national attention in 2015 for charging officers in the in-custody death of Freddie Gray, now herself faces perjury charges over documents she submitted to apply for loans against her retirement plan in 2020, according to the indictment. In doing so, Mosby, whose term in office ends this year, allegedly used a withdrawal option created under the CARES Act, passed to help people who were financially impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. Mosby insisted that she was \u201cunequivocally innocent,\u201d in a news conference Friday, painting the indictment as a politically motivated attack just months before an election. She did not address the charges in detail, acknowledging that there were some things she couldn\u2019t say. \u201cBut I wanted the people of Baltimore to hear it from me: I\u2019ve done nothing wrong,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI did not defraud anyone to take my money from my retirement savings and I did not lie on any mortgage application.\u201d Who is Marilyn Mosby? (2015) When Mosby applied for two loans against her 457(b) retirement plan, she signed documents that indicated she \u201cexperienced adverse financial consequences\u201d due to Covid-19, according to the indictment. However, the indictment said her gross income in 2020 was $247,955.58, an increase of nearly $10,000 from the previous year. Mosby received $36,000 in May and $45,000 in December of 2020 from her retirement account, according to the indictment. The money Mosby received allegedly went toward the purchase of two vacation homes in Florida, and she is also charged with making false statements on the mortgage applications, according to the indictment. She secured a $490,500 mortgage in 2020 and a $428,400 mortgage in 2021, but she did not disclose in the applications that she owed more than $45,000 in federal back taxes, the indictment says. Additionally, Mosby allegedly stated that she would be the primary resident of one of the homes for at least a year in order to receive a lower mortgage rate. But she had already entered an agreement with a vacation home management company to rent out the house the week before, the indictment alleges. She sold one of the properties in November for a $150,000 profit, the Baltimore Sun reported. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be fooled,\u201d Mosby said at the news conference. \u201cWe are now five months from a next election and this indictment is merely a political ploy by my political adversaries to unseat me. Please also understand that I will never let that happen without a fight.\u201d She did not take any questions from reporters. Mosby\u2019s comments echoed an earlier statement by her lawyer, who had also said she is innocent of the charges. \u201cI remain confident that once all the evidence is presented, that she will prevail against these bogus charges \u2013 charges that are rooted in personal, political and racial animus five months from her election,\u201d attorney A. Scott Bolden said in a statement. Freddie Gray officers suing prosecutor Marilyn Mosby (2016) If convicted, Mosby faces a maximum sentence of five years in a federal prison for each perjury count and a maximum of 30 years for each count of making false statements on a mortgage application, according to the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Maryland. She could also be forced to forfeit any property found to have been obtained by fraud, the indictment says. \u201cWe\u2019re not commenting beyond what\u2019s on the indictment. It speaks for itself,\u201d Marcia Murphy, spokesperson for Maryland US Attorney Erek Barron, told CNN. Mosby will have an initial appearance in the US District Court in Baltimore, but the hearing has not yet been scheduled, according to the US Attorney\u2019s office. Mosby was elected as the state\u2019s attorney for Baltimore City in 2014 and reelected in 2018. In 2015, she charged six Baltimore police officers in the death of Gray, who died in police custody after suffering a neck injury while being driven unrestrained in the back of a police van. His death became a symbol of the Black community\u2019s mistrust of police and triggered days of protests and riots in Baltimore. None of the six officers arrested was convicted.",

            "article_content": "A Lafayette, Louisiana, city court judge resigned Friday over a video that surfaced earlier this month showing people using racist language at her home. Michelle Odinet apologized and took a leave of absence after the video became public. It showed surveillance footage \u2013 being played on a television at her house \u2013 of an outdoor altercation with a burglary suspect. As the unseen spectators watch the video, they comment on the footage while repeatedly using a racial slur, CNN has reported. \u201cI take full responsibility for the hurtful words I used to describe the individual who burglarized the vehicles at my home,\u201d Odinet wrote in her resignation letter to Louisiana Supreme Court Chief Justice John Weimer. \u201cAfter much reflection and prayer, and in order to facilitate healing within the community, I hereby resign as judge of the Lafayette City Court effective immediately,\u201d she wrote. Her departure comes after New Orleans District Attorney Jason Williams said last week he ordered his civil rights division to review all cases prosecuted by Odinet, who once served as an assistant district attorney in Louisiana\u2019s most populous city. \u201cThat a judge and former prosecutor so comfortably employed a racial epithet serves as a telling reminder that the attitudes which fostered mass incarceration continue to undermine our pursuit of equal justice,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMoreover, the casual dehumanization displayed by Judge Odinet raises serious questions about her impartiality and the presence of bias and discrimination in her work.\u201d Earlier this month, the Lafayette Police Department said, two vehicles were burglarized in the driveway of a home owned by Odinet and her husband. One of the victims was returning home when she or he saw the suspect exit one of the vehicles, police said. The suspect was pursued, caught and held down till officers arrived, police said. New Orleans' DA will review old cases that were handled by a prosecutor who's now a judge on leave over a video with racist language In the video from Odinet\u2019s home, which circulated online, people appear to be watching footage of the incident on a TV. A male voice is heard saying, \u201cMom\u2019s yelling n***er, n***er.\u201d A female voice then says while laughing, \u201cIt\u2019s a n***er, like a roach.\u201d It\u2019s unknown who recorded the video or how it became public. Odinet apologized and said she\u2019d been \u201cgiven a sedative,\u201d according to CNN affiliate KATC. She had no \u201crecollection of the video and the disturbing language used during it,\u201d she said. \u201cThe (burglary) shook me to my core and my mental state was fragile,\u201d she told the station. \u201cI was a wreck and am still unable to sleep. I was given a sedative at the time of the video.\u201d Attorney Dane Ciolino told The Acadiana Advocate her client was \u201chumiliated, embarrassed, and sorry for what she has done and the harm she has caused to the community.\u201d The state Supreme Court ordered her disqualification and appointed retired Opelousas City Court Judge Vanessa Harris to fill her seat temporarily. Odinet initially took an unpaid leave of absence amid calls for her resignation by Gov. John Bel Edwards, the local chapter of the NAACP and the the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus. On Friday, she obliged those demanding she step down. \u201cMs. Odinet understands that this is the end of her public service, but only the beginning of what she must to do to earn the forgiveness of the community,\u201d Ciolino said. In her resignation letter, Odinet wrote she was forwarding her correspondence to the Louisiana Secretary of State in hopes that a special election can be scheduled to fill the bench vacancy. \u201cI am sorry for the pain that I have caused my community and ask for your forgiveness, as my words did not foster the public\u2019s confidence and integrity for the judiciary,\u201d Odinet wrote. CNN\u2019s Ryan Young, Maria Cartaya, Alta Spells, Tina Burnside, Gregory Lemos and Kay Jones contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is 0-for-an awful lot in Georgia since 2016. While the ex-president won the Peach State six years ago en route to the White House, it\u2019s been a disastrous playing field for him ever since, rejecting his first reelection bid and his midterm revenge candidates. His former aides and allies, meanwhile, are being called before a special grand jury in the state investigating his efforts to overthrow President Joe Biden\u2019s win there in 2020. On Tuesday, Trump\u2019s run of Georgia futility could continue unless Heisman Trophy-winning ex-Georgia running back Herschel Walker can drag the MAGA banner over the line. Georgia voters once again have the last word during election season The Georgia Senate runoff represents Trump\u2019s final opportunity to recast a painful midterm season in which his election-denying candidates flopped in swing states, casting a shadow over his nascent 2024 presidential bid. A Walker win would be a rare victory for one of Trump\u2019s recruits and potentially energize his lackluster campaign, while helping Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell limit Democratic power in Washington. But a Walker loss would add to frustration in the GOP over Trump\u2019s political meddling, after his obsession with false voter fraud claims was widely blamed for costing the party control of the Senate in a pair of Georgia runoffs in 2021. The ex-president\u2019s record in Georgia is so poor that he wasn\u2019t wanted in the state as Walker has tried to topple Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in recent weeks. Most galling for Trump, his hand-picked candidate spent his time cozying up to newly reelected Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who far outpaced Walker\u2019s vote totals in November. Kemp defeated a Trump-backed primary challenger earlier this year, defying the former president\u2019s attempt to avenge his refusal to overturn Biden\u2019s narrow in win in the state in 2020. While he was persona non grata during the Senate runoff, Trump did call into a Georgia tele-rally on Monday night \u2013 only when it was probable that he could do no damage given that nearly 2 million Georgians voted early. \u201cA vote for Raphael Warnock is a vote to give Chuck Schumer and the unhinged far-left Democrats total control of the United States Senate. We can\u2019t let this happen,\u201d Trump said in the short appearance. But if Walker loses on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s poor record in many of the midterm election races that matter in 2022 will be complete and there will be a strong case that after embracing weak candidates in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, he once again cost the Republican Party control of the Senate. Trump's slow 2024 start worries allies Walker, for example, has denied several reports that he pressured or encouraged women into having abortions despite previously saying on the campaign trail that he supported a ban on the procedure with no exceptions. CNN\u2019s KFile raised new doubts about Walker\u2019s residency when it revealed he\u2019s getting a tax break intended only for a primary residence this year on his home in the Dallas, Texas, area. KFile also reported that Walker described himself as living in Texas during a speech during the 2022 campaign. And Walker\u2019s bizarre comments \u2013 like a recent discourse on whether it was better to be a werewolf or a vampire \u2013 raised questions about his fitness for office. Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, another GOP politician in the state who stood up to Trump, described Walker last week to CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett as \u201cprobably the worst Republican candidate in the history of politics.\u201d But Trump really needs Walker to come through on Tuesday. The ex-president\u2019s recent lack of success \u2013 alongside his increasingly extreme rhetoric and associations, including with antisemites \u2013 is one reason why some Republicans and top donors say it\u2019s now time to turn to a new presidential prospect: maybe Florida\u2019s newly reelected Gov. Ron DeSantis. So Trump badly needs a win for Walker to reset impressions of his stuttering presidential bid following a low wattage roll-out. But a loss would be further evidence to any Republicans who want to listen that the ex-president\u2019s approach and reputation are poisonous among the swing-state and national electorates that will decide the presidency in 2024. And it would suggest that the way forward for the party might be being blazed by authentic conservatives like Kemp who keep their distance from Trump. It\u2019s far too early to write off Trump in 2024, given his magnetic hold on the Republican grassroots and strong influence on the incoming Republican House majority. But if the ex-president\u2019s political career is on a downward spiral, it\u2019s safe to say that it started in Georgia. The Senate runoff in Georgia caps an extraordinary two years in which the state has emerged, somewhat unexpectedly, as the most competitive battleground in the nation. If he wins, Warnock would greet a full six-year term with relief, after his fourth race \u2013 two general elections and two runoffs in two years \u2013 and he would give the Democrats a widened 51-49 majority in the Senate. What we know about Georgia voters ahead of Senate runoff If Walker prevails, however, the Republican would restore the perilous 50-50 balance in the chamber that has for the past two years only tipped in Democrats\u2019 favor because of tie-breaker votes by Vice President Kamala Harris. Georgia\u2019s political ascendancy epitomizes the multiple forces defining American politics. It is part of a racially diversifying nation that is scrambling the presidential map. It has witnessed a duel between a Republican legislature accused of suppressing voting rights and voters who repeatedly show up in massive numbers to make sure their voices are heard. The state\u2019s agonized racial history is a constant backdrop, especially in the fight between Warnock, a senior pastor at Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church, and Walker, a hero to many in the state following his stellar college football career. Georgia has also become the epicenter of rare Republican resistance toward Trump\u2019s attempt to subvert American democracy. In a call on January 2, 2021, Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d sufficient votes to overturn Biden\u2019s victory. A transcript of the call shows Raffensperger repeatedly pushing back against Trump\u2019s wild conspiracies about fraud. \u201cThe numbers are the numbers, the numbers don\u2019t lie,\u201d Raffensperger later told the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. How Donald Trump is helping Raphael Warnock in Georgia In December 2020, the then-president had also called Kemp to pressure him to convince state legislators to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the state. But the governor said he had no authority to do so, sources told CNN. In revenge, Trump endorsed primary challengers against both men. He said that his pick for secretary of state, Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, would, unlike the incumbent, \u201cstop the fraud.\u201d The ex-president\u2019s endorsed candidate for Kemp\u2019s job \u2013 former Sen. David Perdue, who had lost to Democrat Jon Ossoff in a 2021 runoff \u2013 signed up to Trump\u2019s election denialism, declaring at a debate that \u201cthe election in 2020 was rigged and stolen.\u201d But both Trump\u2019s picks performed disastrously in the primary in a massive embarrassment for the former president. Kemp beat Perdue by 74% to 22% and Raffensperger dispatched Hice by 52% to 33%. Both incumbents were then reelected in November. Trump\u2019s humiliation was becoming a bit of a pattern in Georgia. In the general election in the Peach State in 2020, he became the first Republican to lose in the longtime southern Republican bastion since ex-president George H.W. Bush was outpaced by Bill Clinton in 1992 on his way to the White House. On the eve of the Senate runoffs in January 2021, Trump returned to Georgia to campaign for then-Sens. Kelly Loeffler and Perdue. He slammed Kemp and made false claims of voter fraud, which came on top of the long-standing doubts he\u2019d already sown about mail-in voting among GOP voters during the Covid-19 pandemic. Both GOP senators promptly lost. All of this helps explain why many observers have concluded that during the current runoff election, Trump has actually been more of a help to Warnock than Walker. In a CNN/SSRS poll released on Friday, Trump had a favorable rating of just 39% and an unfavorable rating of 54% among likely Georgia voters. (Biden\u2019s approval rating was also underwater, which explains why he hasn\u2019t set foot in Georgia either.) Walker, however, is insisting that a strong turnout from Republicans on Tuesday can hand him victory. \u201cBefore a big game, I don\u2019t sleep, because I\u2019m ready,\u201d he said during a final campaign stop in the Georgia suburbs. \u201cThis is about turnout. Now we\u2019ve got to get in the game. We can\u2019t sit on the sideline anymore.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the final undecided Senate contest of 2022, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia holds a narrow lead over Republican challenger Herschel Walker among those likely to vote in a runoff election Tuesday, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. The survey shows that Walker faces widespread questions about his honesty and suffers from a negative favorability rating, while nearly half of those who back him say their vote is more about opposition to Warnock than support for Walker. Voters\u2019 modestly more positive views of Warnock and a firmly committed base of supporters appear to boost the incumbent in the new poll. Overall, 52% of likely voters say they plan to support Warnock in Tuesday\u2019s runoff and 48% pick Walker. Partisans on both sides are deeply entrenched, with nearly all Democrats (99%) behind Warnock and 95% of Republicans backing Walker. Independents break in Warnock\u2019s favor, 61% to 36%, but make up a relatively small slice of likely voters, 17%, compared with 24% in a CNN exit poll of voters in the first round of this contest last month. (Warnock finished narrowly ahead of Walker in November but without the majority of the vote needed to avoid a runoff.) Early voting surges in Georgia as Walker and Warnock make their final pitches to swing voters White voters remain broadly behind Walker ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election: 69% support him, with 30% backing Warnock, in the new poll, while Black voters likely to cast a ballot next week are near unanimous in their support for the Democrat (96% Warnock to 3% Walker). Those divides are similar to the racial split in the 2021 runoff during which Warnock initially won his seat, when 93% of Black voters backed him while 71% of White voters favored his Republican opponent, then-Sen. Kelly Loeffler, according to CNN\u2019s exit poll. There is also a wide age gap in the upcoming contest, with voters under 35 sharply behind Warnock (74% to 25%), while those 65 or older break in Walker\u2019s favor by 26 points (63% to 37%). Younger White voters are far more closely divided than older White voters (52% Walker to 48% Warnock among White voters younger than 45, while 75% of White voters age 45 or older say they back Walker). Support for Warnock is about the same among younger and older Black voters. White voters without college degrees are heavily behind Walker \u2013 83% support him \u2013 while White voters with four-year degrees are closely divided, 51% Walker to 47% Warnock. White women with degrees tilt toward Warnock (53% Warnock to 44% for Walker) while White men with degrees break in Walker\u2019s favor (58% Walker to 42% Warnock). Warnock\u2019s supporters broadly say they are casting ballots to support their candidate (83%) rather than to oppose Walker (17%), but it\u2019s a more mixed bag among those who favor Walker (52% say their vote is more to support him, 47% to oppose Warnock). That difference, the poll suggests, could be a factor in driving turnout. The runoff between Warnock and Walker is the only race on the ballot in most of the state, and voters who say they are voting more to support their Senate candidate than to oppose the other candidate express deeper motivation to vote \u2013 79% of likely voters who say their vote is to support their chosen candidate are extremely motivated to vote, compared with 69% among those who say their vote is more one of opposition. There are several indications in the poll that negative views of Walker are also a potential drag on his chances. Beyond the gap in affirmative support behind each man\u2019s candidacy, there\u2019s a big difference in views of Warnock and Walker personally. Views of Warnock tilt narrowly positive, with 50% of likely voters holding a favorable opinion, 45% unfavorable, while far more likely Georgia voters have a negative view of Walker (52%) than a positive one (39%). Woman alleges to Daily Beast that Herschel Walker was violent with her in 2005 A broad majority say that Walker is not honest and trustworthy \u2013 59% feel that way, including 18% of those who say they plan to vote for the Republican. A narrow majority, 52%, say they believe Warnock is honest and trustworthy, and views of his honesty are closely connected to vote choice (93% of Warnock\u2019s own voters say he is honest, 91% of Walker\u2019s voters say Warnock is not honest). Walker holds a wide lead among those likely voters who say that neither Walker nor Warnock are honest and trustworthy (they break 71% Walker to 27% Warnock). Likely voters are more apt to see Warnock than Walker as well qualified to serve as senator (52% say that describes Warnock better, 27% Walker, and 21% say neither is well qualified); as someone who would represent Georgia effectively in Congress (50% Warnock, 41% Walker, 8% neither); as someone who has good judgment (50% Warnock, 33% Walker, 17% neither); and as someone who has the right priorities (49% Warnock, 43% Walker, 7% neither). Among the roughly 1 in 5 likely voters who say neither candidate is well-qualified, about 9 in 10 back Walker (92%), and he wins roughly 8 in 10 of those who say neither candidate has good judgment (82% say they\u2019ll vote for Walker). Still, when asked directly whether their votes are more about the candidates\u2019 positions on the issues or their character and integrity, 57% of likely voters say issues are the more important factor and 42% choose character and integrity. Among those saying that the issues are their main concern, 64% are voting for Walker; on the character side, 74% favor Warnock. Nearly half of likely voters say the economy is their top issue in this runoff contest (46%), while 17% say voting rights and election integrity is their top concern and 16% choose abortion as their top issue. Walker holds 68% support among economy-focused voters, while broad majorities of both those who called elections and voting their top issue (79%) and those most concerned with abortion (78%) back Warnock. About half of likely voters (48%) say that abortion should be legal under most circumstances (37% say it should be legal under any circumstances, 11% in most circumstances), while 52% say it ought to be either legal in only a few circumstances (39%) or illegal in all circumstances (13%). The issue sharply divides the electorate: Those voters who feel it should be legal in most or all cases break heavily in Warnock\u2019s favor, 88% for him vs. 11% for Walker, while those who say it should be legal in only a few cases or illegal in all circumstances are broadly behind Walker \u2013 82% back him to 18% who favor Warnock. Why Democrats should like the early voting patterns in the Georgia Senate runoff After an extended legal battle over when early voting would be allowed in the run-up to the runoff election, likely Georgia voters largely feel that the rules around voting in the runoff were about right. About 1 in 5 say they thought the rules made it too hard to vote (21%), a smaller share say it was too easy (14%) and around two-thirds say the rules were about right (66%). Liberals (47%), voters who considered voting rights and election integrity a top issue (39%) and Democrats (38%) were among the most likely to say the rules made it too hard to vote. President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating in the new poll stands at 42% approve to 57% disapprove, about the same as in the November CNN exit poll among Georgia voters who cast ballots in the first round of this Senate race (41% approved, 58% disapproved). But both Biden and his predecessor, former President Donald Trump, are viewed negatively in Georgia. In the new poll, 41% hold a favorable view of Biden and 52% an unfavorable one, while views of Trump split 39% favorable to 54% unfavorable. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from November 25-29 in Georgia, using a combination of online and telephone interviews. The survey samples were originally drawn from two sources \u2013 a probability-based online panel and a registration-based sample \u2013 and combined. Respondents were initially contacted by mail, phone or email. Results among the full sample of 1,886 registered voters has an error margin of plus or minus 3 points. Likely voters were identified through a series of questions about their intention to, interest in and past history of voting. Results among 1,184 likely voters have an error margin of plus or minus 3.8 points.",

            "article_content": "More than 1 million Georgians have voted early (absentee or in-person) ahead of Tuesday\u2019s Senate runoff election. The compact nature of the early voting period for the runoff makes it difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison with what occurred during the November general election. Still, there are a number of notable trends that suggest an upside for Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in his race against Republican Herschel Walker. This doesn\u2019t mean Warnock is definitely going to win, but the data indicates you\u2019d rather be Warnock than Walker right now. Early voting surges in Georgia as Walker and Warnock make their final pitches to swing voters When examining early voting, keep in mind we do not know how people are voting in the runoff. We know how voters as a group cast ballots in the general election. Groups that were more favorable for Warnock seem to be voting in larger numbers now compared with the general election when a similar number of early ballots were cast. Remember too that Warnock got more votes than Walker in November, even though both failed to take a majority of the vote to avoid a runoff. This means Walker needs to gain more (or lose fewer) voters than Warnock in order to win. Perhaps the best way to see if Walker voters are turning out in larger numbers is to look at race and age. Warnock won Black voters 90% to 8% in November\u2019s general election. Walker won White voters 70% to 28%. So far in early voting, Black voters make up a little more than 33% of the electorate, while White voters account for 54%. At a roughly similar point in the general election based on the number of early votes cast, about 31% of voters were Black and about 57% were White. This may seem like a small difference, but given the large partisan gap between Black and White voters, it suggests that those who have gone to the polls so far are more Democratic than at a similar point in the general election. I should note that a number of Democratic counties opened up early in-person voting sooner than Republican-leaning counties. That said, voters in all Georgia counties have been able to cast a ballot for a number of days now, and the racial voting gap between the general election and runoff has not gone away. Warnock and Walker court Kemp voters in final week of Georgia Senate runoff Moreover, the current trendline looks similar to what we saw two years ago in Georgia. Black voters made up a larger share of early voters in the 2021 Senate runoffs than at a similar period during the 2020 general election. And once all the votes were counted, it was clear that turnout in heavily Black counties saw less of a drop-off compared with other counties. Democrats, of course, gained ground during the runoffs from the general election and captured two Senate seats in the process. We don\u2019t know if that will happen this time, but the racial makeup of the early electorate isn\u2019t the only worrisome sign for Republicans. Voters under 30 are about 7% of early voters so far. They were around 6% during the general election when a similar number of early votes had been cast. On the other end, voters 65 and older account for 43% of early voters at this point. During the general election, they were a little north of 44% at a similar stage. And although the partisan gap between senior citizens and those under 30 isn\u2019t as large as the one between White and Black voters, it was substantial in the general election. Those under 30 voted for Warnock by 29 points in the general election, while those 65 and older backed Walker by 17 points. The difference in the age makeup of the electorate between the general election and the runoff so far is small. It\u2019s still notable, though, especially in combination with the difference we\u2019re seeing based on race. This isn\u2019t just about general election voters casting ballots at different times (i.e., earlier or later) compared with the general election, either. About 3% to 4% of the runoff electorate so far didn\u2019t vote in the general election. Those voters are more likely to be Black and under 30 than early voters as a whole. If nothing else, Republicans likely have to do better among the runoff ballots yet to be cast than they did with the remaining ballots at a similar point during the general election. Early voting ends on Friday. Additionally, there may end up being fewer additional ballots cast from this point forward. Runoffs in Georgia generally have lower turnout than general elections, and control of the Senate is not dependent on the Georgia outcome. Given the early vote patterns so far, this probably means Warnock is a little bit closer to the finish line than Walker.",

            "article_content": "After more than three hours of oral arguments in a single case last week, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts uttered the traditional closer, \u201cThe case is submitted.\u201d But the hearing wasn\u2019t over. Roberts, a details man who usually hews to script, had forgotten that a lawyer had yet to take his rebuttal time. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Roberts said to Matthew McGill, who rose to his place at the lectern. \u201cIt is late.\u201d Women disrupt Supreme Court arguments to protest Dobbs decision Yet another Supreme Court case had gone nearly twice as long as scheduled \u2013 a pattern testing the nerves of the justices this fall. Some exchange glances when a loquacious colleague engages in protracted questioning. Many interrupt answers to queries simply to get their own in. Roberts, in the center chair and keeping track of the interjections from the left and right, often looks weary, leaning head on hand. The usual morning sessions that begin at 10 a.m. are going well past the noon lunch hour. When the court heard a pair of challenges to the use of affirmative action in college admissions on October 31, the justices went without lunch until after 3 p.m. Still, as much as the marathon arguments have challenged the stamina of everyone in the courtroom, they have provided early insights on the justices this 2022-23 term. Liberals, who lost ground on many areas of the law last session, notably when the conservative majority jettisoned women\u2019s abortion rights, have come back strong in the court\u2019s most public forum. Those three on the left (Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson) have actively tried to poke holes in cases but also have been making sweeping statements to draw attention to larger liberal concerns. \u201cI think Kafka would have loved this,\u201d Kagan declared of a state system that repeatedly thwarted a murder defendant\u2019s challenge to his death sentence. The two most consistent conservatives, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, have demonstrated how much further to the right they want to push the court to narrow federal voting safeguards and eliminate college affirmative action. They appear ready to reverse a 1978 landmark decision that allowed race-based admissions to enhance campus diversity. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the word \u2018diversity\u2019 quite a few times,\u201d Thomas said, \u201cand I don\u2019t have a clue what it means. It seems to mean everything for everyone.\u201d Thomas has criticized affirmative action as unconstitutional as well as stigmatizing to Black students. Justice Neil Gorsuch, who is usually with Thomas and Alito on cases, reinforced in recent arguments where he parts company. The court\u2019s most prominent supporter of Native American rights, Gorsuch staunchly defended the Indian Child Welfare Act\u2019s preferences for placement of Native American adoptees with other Native American families. A key question is whether the law unconstitutionally discriminates on the basis of race or allows the federal government to tread on state authority. \u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand why this (law) falls on the other side of the line, when Congress makes the judgment that this is essential to Indian self-preservation of Indian tribes,\u201d Gorsuch said. Takeaways from SCOTUS affirmative action cases: Conservatives may overturn precedent allowing race as a factor in admissions Fellow conservative Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett are known to offer mixed signals in the public oral argument sessions. They sometimes suggest a middle-ground course but then move right when it comes time for the bottom-line vote. Roberts is still largely with his fellow conservative appointees, although he has joined the left in a few high-profile instances. So far this session, he has rarely dominated the hearings, but he has pressed his own interests, especially to end race-based practices. And in the Indian Child Welfare Act dispute, he expressed concern that the law would cause the best interests of the child to \u201cbe subordinated to the interests of the tribe.\u201d Until the Covid-19 pandemic, beginning in early 2020, Roberts presided over fairly tight one-hour sessions. As justices jockeyed to ask questions of a lawyer standing below the bench, speed and brevity were valued. The clock ruled, and rarely would a case get more than one hour of time. When the justices moved to teleconference questioning during the pandemic, Roberts necessarily changed the routine so that the attorneys at the other end of the phone line knew which justice was speaking. Each of the nine justices was to take about three minutes to ask questions, in order of seniority. Many of them went over time, as did the lawyers at the other end of the phone line. But the format had the advantage of ensuring that no justice was elbowed out of the Q-and-A. Since returning to the courtroom late last year, the justices have employed a format that begins largely with the old free-for-all but then adds a second round during which each justice gets a chance to ask any lingering queries. That has encouraged talkativeness \u2013 especially of the newest justice, Jackson. Adam Feldman, who tracks patterns during oral arguments at his Empirical SCOTUS blog, found that during the first two weeks of cases argued in October Jackson spoke more than twice as much as any other justice, based simply on word count. The justices\u2019 actual votes in cases occur behind closed doors and the outcomes of the biggest controversies are unlikely to emerge until next spring. Still, argument by argument, one by one, the justices are revealing dimensions of themselves now. Roberts, 67, appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005 In trying to keep order in the give-and-take and move things along, Roberts has gotten ahead of himself more than once. During an October argument he presumed the justices\u2019 questioning of lawyer Timothy Bishop in a dispute over a California law regulating pork sold in the state, tied to the confinement conditions for pigs in other states, was finally over. So he called up the next lawyer, deputy US Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler. But Bishop wasn\u2019t moving away from the microphone. Bishop was still entitled to the second round of justices\u2019 questions. Sotomayor said hesitantly, \u201cChief?\u201d That\u2019s when Roberts realized his mistake. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry, Mr. Kneedler,\u201d Roberts said, indicating that he should stay seated, and turning to his colleagues for questions to Bishop. John Roberts shows he still has a grip on the Supreme Court On the substance of the early cases this session, Roberts has revealed his continued abhorrence for race-based classifications. Echoing some of Thomas\u2019 criticism for admissions practices at the University of North Carolina, Roberts told state solicitor general Ryan Park, \u201cYour position is that race matters because it\u2019s necessary for diversity, which is necessary for the sort of education you want. It\u2019s not going to stop mattering at some particular point. You\u2019re always going to have to look at race because you say race matters to give us the necessary diversity.\u201d Thomas, 74, a 1991 appointee of President George H.W. Bush The current court\u2019s longest-tenured justice rarely spoke under the old pre-pandemic format, turned off by the rapid-fire questioning. In the modified format, Roberts gives Thomas the first question of the first round, before other justices engage, and then returns to him as the structured second series begins. Thomas makes points on the law and has shown some levity. In a copyright dispute involving a Lynn Goldsmith photograph of the musician Prince adapted in an illustration by Andy Warhol, Thomas began a hypothetical query, \u201c\u2026 let\u2019s say that I\u2019m both a Prince fan, which I was in the \u201980s and \u2026\u201d Before he could go further, Kagan interjected, \u201cNo longer?\u201d To laughter, Thomas responded, \u201cWell\u2026 so only on Thursday nights.\u201d Then he continued: \u201cBut let\u2019s say that I\u2019m also a Syracuse fan, and I decide to make one of those big blowup posters of Orange Prince and change the colors a little bit around the edges and put \u2018Go Orange\u2019 underneath. Would you sue me for infringement?\u201d Alito, 72, a 2006 appointee of George W. Bush He has always been a sharp interlocutor who does not hedge his views. In a voting rights case from Alabama, he made plain that he would narrow the reach of the Voting Rights Act in a way that would make it harder to prove race discrimination in voting practices, such as redistricting. (Alabama\u2019s Black population is about 27%, but only one of its seven congressional districts has a Black majority, and a lower federal court found that the map diluted Black votes in violation of the VRA.) Alito suggested the approach of challengers to the Alabama map would set an easy standard that allows them to \u201crun the table\u201d against a state. He also suggested that \u201ca community of interest,\u201d involving residents\u2019 common backgrounds supporting a second Black-majority district, was an invalid \u201cproxy for race.\u201d Separately, Alito has also implied he may feel a bit over the hill. He drew some courtroom laughter in one case when he referred to a 1974 law and quipped, \u201cI actually do remember 1974.\u201d In another, regarding overtime pay and time-off practices for executive and daily wage workers, he said, \u201cDoes somebody who\u2019s out working on an oil rig have the option, as a practical matter, to take the day off? I\u2019d like to take the day off and play golf.\u201d Sotomayor, 68, a 2009 appointee of President Barack Obama After Thomas laid out his scenario regarding copyright of a photograph of the late musician Prince, Sotomayor began her round of questioning lightly, \u201cI think my colleague, Justice Thomas, needs a lawyer, and I\u2019m going to provide it.\u201d Sotomayor speaks about the new dynamic of having 4 women on Supreme Court Sotomayor, who is now the court\u2019s senior liberal, is also a sharp questioner, admonishing evasive lawyers and directly countering colleagues. Regarding Alito\u2019s comments on voting rights, she said, \u201cJustice Alito gave the game away when he said race-neutral means don\u2019t look at community of interest because it\u2019s a proxy for race.\u201d And she said his approach to the 1965 Voting Rights Act would essentially turn the law \u201con its head.\u201d The country\u2019s first Hispanic justice, Sotomayor stressed that the law was intended to ensure that \u201ca particular racial minority \u2026 can equally participate.\u201d Kagan, 62, a 2010 appointee of Obama She often relies on a colloquial style to make her legal points, contrasting in the affirmative-action dispute, for example, \u201cWhite men (who) get the thumb on the scale\u201d with \u201cpeople who have been kicked in the teeth by our society for centuries.\u201d But she often voices larger dilemmas of the country\u2019s law. In the controversy over federal safeguards for election practices, Kagan described the 1965 Voting Rights Act as \u201cone of the great achievements of American democracy, to achieve equal political opportunities regardless of race, to ensure that African Americans could have as much political power as White Americans could. That\u2019s a pretty big deal.\u201d During an Arizona capital case, she rebuked a deputy state attorney general for flouting earlier Supreme Court decisions requiring jurors to be told in certain cases if the murder defendant would be ineligible for parole if sentenced to life. \u201cIt suggests that the state in its many forms, many actors, is just insisting on not applying (precedent)\u2026,\u201d Kagan said. \u201cIt sounds like you\u2019re thumbing your nose at us.\u201d Gorsuch, 55, a 2017 appointee of President Donald Trump In oral arguments, he is variable. He did not ask a single question during the nearly three hours of arguments on the Voting Rights Act. But he dominated the dispute over the placement of Native American children in foster or adoptive care. The 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act sets out preferences for Indian children placed in foster care or adopted: the child\u2019s extended family, other members of the Indian child\u2019s tribe, and other Indian families, over placement with a White or other non-Native American family. When he addressed Texas solicitor general Judd Stone, who was urging the court to strike down the law as discriminatory and an overreach of Congress\u2019 power, Gorsuch said, \u201chow about the fact that the federal government has been heavily involved in domestic affairs, with respect to Native American children throughout our history, whether it\u2019s through treaties, orphan children, or whether it was through the boarding school saga of the last century?\u201d Gorsuch questioned why that pattern wasn\u2019t evidence of Congress\u2019s nearly unlimited power in this area of the law. When Stone said Congress might have been invoking its \u201cordinary powers\u201d involving territory or appropriations, Gorsuch shot back: \u201cThey took children off-reservation, counsel.\u201d Kavanaugh, 57, a 2018 appointee of Trump He regularly speaks of balancing interests. In the Native American adoption case, he said, \u201cThe equal protection issue is difficult, I think, because we have to find the line between two fundamental and critical constitutional values. So, on the one hand, the great respect for tribal self-government for the success of Indian tribes \u2026 with recognition of the history of oppression and discrimination against tribes and people. \u2026 On the other hand, the fundamental principle we don\u2019t treat people differently on account of their race or ethnicity or ancestry, equal justice under law\u2026\u201d Kavanaugh sits between Jackson and Kagan at one end of the bench and can sometimes recede as they pummel the lawyers before them. At one point in an employee compensation case, he and Jackson were simultaneously asking questions. Flustered, the lawyer said, \u201cThis is my first argument. Now I got two \u2026  I don\u2019t know how to go\u2026.\u201d Suggested Kavanaugh, \u201cAnswer them both.\u201d Barrett, 50, appointed in 2020 by Trump She sits at the far other end of the bench, and appears mindful of the time, looking down the row to make sure she\u2019s not about to cut off a more senior colleague\u2019s question. Her queries and hypothetical scenarios often reflect her background. \u201cI grew up in New Orleans. The whole thing is below sea level,\u201d she said during a controversy involving Clean Water Act regulations that limit building construction. \u201cSo, you know, there are aquifers that run right underneath it. We have no basements because, you dig far enough in anybody\u2019s yard, you hit water, and all of that runs into Lake Pontchartrain and the Mississippi River, navigable waters.\u201d She wondered, therefore, whether anyone who wanted to build on a lot would have to obtain a Clean Water Act permit before proceeding. Her inclinations related to social policy dilemmas emerge, too. In the dispute over California regulation of pig confinement to prevent animal cruelty, she asked, \u201cSo, could you have California pass a law that said we\u2019re not going to buy any pork from companies that don\u2019t require all their employees to be vaccinated or from corporations that don\u2019t fund gender-affirming surgery or that sort of thing?\u201d Jackson, 52, appointed this year by President Joe Biden The former federal public defender and first Black woman justice has tried to pull the court leftward on criminal defense and racial issues. During the case involving Alabama\u2019s voting map and the challengers\u2019 effort to obtain two Black-majority districts, Jackson said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem, because I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution, at what the framers and the founders thought about. \u2026 When I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause \u2026  in a race conscious way.\u201d Ketanji Brown Jackson issues her first written opinion as a Supreme Court justice -- a dissent In the second month of arguments, Jackson has seemed slightly more attentive to the time she is consuming. \u201cI have little time,\u201d she told one lawyer as she cut off his answer to her so she could get another question in. In a separate criminal case, as a government lawyer was finishing his opening statement, she immediately began asking a question. But then she caught herself. \u201cSorry,\u201d she said, looking down the row, \u201cDoes anybody else have a question?\u201d Hearing nothing, she fired off a series of queries.",

            "article_content": "Michelle Obama addressed in a new book the deep hurt and disappointment she felt when Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election. \u201cIt shook me profoundly to hear the man who replaced my husband as president openly and unapologetically using ethnic slurs, making selfishness and hate somehow acceptable, refusing to condemn white supremacists or to support people demonstrating for racial justice,\u201d wrote Obama in \u201cThe Light We Carry,\u201d a copy of which was obtained by CNN. \u201cIt shocked me to hear him speaking about differentness as if it were a threat.\u201d Audio excerpts from the book were first released Monday to NPR. Obama wrote that she and Barack Obama had built their principles on \u201chope and hard work,\u201d and that she was confounded when the country chose to elect Trump. Michelle Obama praises Biden but stops short of full-throated 2024 endorsement \u201cFor eight years, we tried to live those principles out loud, recognizing that we made it as far as we had despite and maybe even in defiance of the bigotry and bias so deeply embedded in American life,\u201d said Michelle Obama. \u201cWe understood that our presence as Black people in the White House said something about what was possible.

            "article_content": "Lawmakers are set to return on Monday after being away for several weeks campaigning for the crucial midterm elections. They face a jam-packed legislative to-do list before the new congressional session begins in January. With that in mind, Democratic leaders are eager to bring several bills to the floor for votes during the lame duck session \u2013 the period after the midterms and before the new Congress begins. The busy agenda includes: Funding the government to avert a shutdown before the end of the calendar year, passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, the annual must-pass legislation that sets the policy agenda and authorizes funding for the Department of Defense, a vote in the Senate to protect same-sex marriage and possible consideration of other key issues. While Democrats may have bucked the national trend, Republicans still hold a large sway in GOP-led states While the House is able to pass legislation by a simple majority, Democrats in the Senate face an uphill climb given their narrow majority. With a 50-50 partisan split in the Senate, Democrats lack the votes to overcome the filibuster\u2019s 60-vote threshold \u2013 and do not have enough support within their party to abolish the filibuster, as many are anxious to do. Therefore, major priorities for liberal voters \u2013 like the passage of legislation protecting access to abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade \u2013 are expected to remain out of reach for the party for the foreseeable future. Democrats, who currently control both chambers, are returning with a new reality in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s election they did not expect: Key races that will determine the balance of power in the House have not been called, and CNN has not yet projected who would control the House. While Republicans still appear likely to win enough seats to control the chamber, it would likely be with a narrower margin than originally anticipated. On Saturday, CNN projected that Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada will win reelection, meaning the Democrats will continue to control the Senate once the news session of Congress starts in January. But with a runoff election set for Georgia\u2019s US Senate seat set for December 6, the final make-up of the chamber won\u2019t be known until at least then. At a news conference Sunday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer warned of a busy lame-duck session, promising \u201cheavy work\u201d and \u201clong hours,\u201d though he declined to get into specifics, saying he first needs to talk to his caucus about their agenda. Congress passed a short-term funding bill in September that is set to expire December 16, making funding the government the number one priority for Congress when they return from recess. Takeaways from a grim weekend for Republicans in the election that won't end Because the legislation must be passed, it could attract additional measures that Democrats want to clear during the lame duck session. For example, additional financial support for Ukraine as it continues to defend itself against Russia. While that funding has bipartisan support, some conservatives \u2013 such as Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican who is expected to become speaker if his party eventually wins the chamber \u2013 are balking at the pricey contributions and are vowing to scrutinize more closely additional requests from the Biden administration, a dynamic that is dividing Republicans. Democrats also want more funding for the Covid-19 pandemic, but Republicans are not likely to support that request. Democrats may also seeking more money for the Department of Justice investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Congress also has to pass the defense bill. Consideration of the wide-ranging bill could spark debate and a push for amendments over a variety of topics, including whether to punish Saudi Arabia for its recent decision to cut oil production. Senate Democrats will also continue confirming judges to the federal bench nominated by President Joe Biden, a key priority for the party. A Senate vote on codifying same-sex marriage is also on tap. In mid-September, the chamber punted on a vote until after the November midterm elections as negotiators asked for more time to lock down support \u2013 a move that could make it more likely the bill will ultimately pass the chamber. The bipartisan group of senators working on the bill said in a statement at the time, \u201cWe\u2019ve asked Leader Schumer for additional time and we appreciate he has agreed. We are confident that when our legislation comes to the Senate floor for a vote, we will have the bipartisan support to pass the bill.\u201d The bill would need at least 10 Republican votes to overcome a filibuster. Schumer has vowed to hold a vote on the bill, but the exact timing has not yet been locked in. Democrats have pushed for the vote after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, sparking fears that the court could take aim at same-sex or inter-racial marriage in the future. Votes are likely on bipartisan legislation that would make it harder to overturn a certified presidential election, a response to former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to block the 2020 election results, which led to the siege of the Capitol. It is supported by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican. If the bill passes the Senate, it would also need to clear the House, which in September, passed its own version of the legislation. Meanwhile, it\u2019s not yet clear when exactly the nation will run up against the debt limit and it appears unlikely for now that Congress will act to raise it during the lame-duck session, especially as other must-pass bills compete for floor time. But political battle lines are already being drawn and maneuvering is underway in Washington over the contentious and high-stakes issue. Democrats are insisting it would be irresponsible to cause a damaging default over paying for bills already accrued. While Republicans are digging in and insisting that they will only approve a debt limit hike if Democrats agree to cut spending moving forward. Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections At his news conference Sunday, Schumer vowed to \u201clook at\u201d the issue over the next few weeks, but said he needs to talk to the other members of leadership and see where the makeup of the House ultimately lands. \u201cThe debt ceiling, of course, is something that we have to deal with. And it\u2019s something that we will look at over the next few weeks,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI have to talk to the leadership first. We don\u2019t know where the House is going to be.\u201d Congress does not need to raise the nation\u2019s borrowing limit until sometime next year, but there\u2019s been some internal debate over whether Democrats should try to raise before the end of this year, especially if Republicans wind up in control of the House. McCarthy thrust the issue to the forefront with comments last month that echoed those of several colleagues. \u201cIf people want to make a debt ceiling (for a longer period of time), just like anything else, there comes a point in time where, OK, we\u2019ll provide you more money, but you got to change your current behavior,\u201d he said in an interview with Punchbowl News. Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar summed up the busy work period ahead in an interview with \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Thursday. \u201cIn Washington, we have a bunch of things on our plate, including getting the defense bill done with Ukraine right before us and the strides that (Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelensky) is making against Vladimir Putin,\u201d she said. \u201cOn our plate is the end-of-the-year budget bill to make sure we get that right, As you know the Electoral Count Act, an effort that I\u2019m leading with (Maine Republican Sen.) Susan Collins and (West Virginia Democratic Sen.) Joe Manchin and others, so we don\u2019t have January 6 happen again. All of that is immediately when we get back.\u201d CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. What the heck were you trying to tell us here, America? It\u2019s hard to break away from simple narratives sometimes, especially when they are reinforced by Democratic gloating about avoiding a Republican rout in the midterm election and moaning by conservatives about their underperformance. At the very least, the split election results may spoil former President Donald Trump\u2019s plan to capitalize on a GOP House victory and announce a 2024 presidential run. In fact, the most successful Republican on Tuesday was Trump\u2019s current chief intraparty rival, Gov. Ron DeSantis in Florida. The larger message may be that, shocker, the country is still very engaged in its politics and divided over who should be in charge, although the lack of major issues administering this election so far is something every American can celebrate. RELATED: How election officials staved off chaos at polling places Tuesday CNN\u2019s Dana Bash noted Wednesday that the results will have a major impact. \u201cThis is a change election in that things are going to change big time in Washington,\u201d she said. \u201cThe White House, most importantly, is gonna have to readjust.\u201d For how historical the overall GOP failure is, I\u2019ll let the pundits go wild. And they are. The fact is that in recent memory \u2013 2002, in the lead-up to the war in Iraq \u2013 George W. Bush\u2019s Republican Party actually picked up House seats in his first midterm. So Democrats\u2019 performance, so far, appears to be better than average, but it\u2019s not unprecedented. At the very least, they defied expectations. But there\u2019s a lot of nuance here, and Democrats should beware declaring victory in an election in which they\u2019re likely to lose the House. The fact is that with scores of undecided House races, Republicans are still on track to take control of the chamber. It would be a small and messy majority beholden to the conservative fringe, but it would be a majority nonetheless. That would mean no more Speaker Nancy Pelosi, no more January 6 committee and no more legislation passing without a majority of Republicans supporting it. From the CNN Election Center as I write this Wednesday evening: It\u2019s not crazy to say, for the sake of argument, Republicans could have around 221 seats, a majority of four seats. That leaves little room for error and whoever can marshal the votes to be speaker \u2013 let\u2019s assume it\u2019s Kevin McCarthy, but not many Republicans are probably super pumped with him right now \u2013 will have a bear of a job. Yes, Democrats picked up a key Senate seat in Pennsylvania. But Republicans are leading in a key Senate race in Nevada, which would put the balance of power in that chamber exactly where it has been: split. In a case of history repeating itself, a Georgia Senate runoff in December could again decide who controls the US Senate. That\u2019s assuming Sen. Mark Kelly\u2019s slim lead holds in Arizona. The 2020 example suggests the late counted vote could advantage Republicans. The Democrat running for governor in Arizona, Katie Hobbs, holds an even slimmer lead over Republican Kari Lake, the former TV anchor turned gubernatorial candidate. Lake is still in the hunt to become Arizona\u2019s next governor, despite the fact that she has already alleged impropriety in an election she might yet win. If elected, she has promised to completely overhaul how the state conducts elections. If Lake can eke out in Arizona and/or Republican Joe Lombardo holds on to his lead over incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak in the race for Nevada governor, it would take some of the sheen off two pickups Democrats achieved, in the Massachusetts and Maryland governor\u2019s races. Let\u2019s see. They\u2019re still counting votes. The Republican running for secretary of state in Nevada, Jim Marchant, a 2020 election denier who has a plan to overhaul elections there, also holds the slimmest lead as votes continue to be counted. If the GOP leads in Nevada for US Senate, governor and secretary of state hold, Silver State voters will have handed much of their state\u2019s power to Republicans while also voting for some Democratic priorities, like a state Equal Rights Amendment and a measure to raise the state\u2019s minimum wage. Backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to end nationwide abortion rights might have helped Democrats hold back a GOP wave that did not materialize. But Democrats should carefully read exit poll data that suggests a full quarter of the large majority of voters who said abortion should be legal in all or most cases voted for a Republican. There are also regional developments that should give Democrats pause. The two most pivotal battleground states of the \u201990s and early \u201800s, Ohio and Florida, are now all but red states. Republicans are now the majority party in Florida, and DeSantis easily dispatched former Gov. Charlie Crist and gave Republicans hope that a conservative can appeal to a diverse state and particularly to Latino voters. In other states, there\u2019s also evidence that Democrats need to do more to appeal to Latino voters. More Texans are Latino than any other racial subgroup, and yet they were only a little more than 20% of the voters this election in Texas, when Republicans again dashed Democrats\u2019 hopes for any gains in the state. Republicans also made inroads in New York, including Long Island, picking up multiple House seats in one of the bluest states. That\u2019s partly because a court there wouldn\u2019t let Democrats gerrymander congressional districts the way Republicans did in Florida, Texas and elsewhere. Among those New York seats Republicans picked up was the Lower Hudson Valley district of Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who spearheaded Democrats\u2019 congressional strategy this year. Maloney conceded to his GOP challenger Wednesday. His controversial strategy included helping the more extreme Republicans, the Trumpiest, win in multiple House GOP primaries across the country. Maloney\u2019s devil\u2019s bargain was risky, but it paid off for Democrats, who won all of those races, according to Politico. Meanwhile, Maloney will be out of a job come January. Pelosi told colleagues he \u201ctook an arrow\u201d for them. She called it a \u201cPyrrhic victory,\u201d which makes some sense, except it might not end up being a victory at all. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.",

            "article_content": "Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the right-wing Oath Keepers who prosecutors say called for a \u201cbloody revolution\u201d to keep then-President Donald Trump in power, painted himself as an anti-racist Libertarian who believed the 2020 election was unconstitutional as he testified in his own defense on Friday. Rhodes is the first of the five defendants charged with seditious conspiracy in federal court in Washington, DC, to testify. Secret recording: Oath Keepers leader wanted to warn Trump of upcoming 'combat here on US soil' The courtroom was packed during his testimony, and Rhodes choked up several times discussing his family, suicide rates among veterans and other subjects highlighted by his lawyer, Phillip Linder. He spoke directly to the jury and appeared very comfortable on the stand. Rhodes explained to the jury that he didn\u2019t believe either Trump or Joe Biden won in 2020 because the election itself was \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d \u201cI believe the election was unconstitutional, and that made it invalid,\u201d Rhodes testified. \u201cYou really can\u2019t have a winner of an unconstitutional election.\u201d Rhodes told the jury that, as he saw it, election laws in several states were changed by \u201cexecutive fiat\u201d and not through the state legislature. \u201cIn multiple states especially in the swing states \u2026 you had them putting in new rules in direct violation\u201d of state laws, Rhodes said. \u201cEveryone kept focusing on the computers\u201d and other theories of voter fraud, Rhodes said, instead of the constitutional issues, which they needed to discuss before figuring out \u201cwhether there\u2019s fraud on the ground.\u201d Rhodes did not detail any specific laws that were changed. CNN has found no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Prosecutors have alleged that Rhodes wanted Trump to remain in power and that the militia leader supported a \u201cbloody revolution\u201d to secure the presidency. Rhodes told the jury Friday how he was honorably discharged from the military and went on to study law at Yale, focusing his attention on the Bill of Rights \u2013 which Rhodes called \u201cthe crown jewel of our Constitution\u201d \u2013 and protecting civilian rights in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. Rhodes, a self-described Libertarian, testified that he founded the Oath Keepers in 2009 to \u201creach, change and inspire\u201d people about what rights the Constitution afforded them. Oath Keepers spent over $400 at post-US Capitol riot feast at the Olive Garden, prosecutors say Pushing back on what he saw as narratives that the Oath Keepers were racist or white nationalists, Rhodes said the organization traveled to various cities for racial justice protests, claiming the group protected \u201cminority business owners\u201d in Ferguson, Missouri. \u201cFrankly we kind of embarrassed the police, Rhodes testified, \u201cbecause we showed them how to do it right, protecting the business owners while still respecting the rights of the protesters.\u201d Oath Keepers rules, Rhodes claimed, specifically bar any member who \u201cadvocates for the overthrow of the United States.\u201d During the first several weeks of the seditious conspiracy trial against the far-right organization, prosecutors presented evidence that the Oath Keepers stockpiled weapons at a hotel in Virginia on January 6 as part of a so-called quick reaction force. Prosecutors alleged that the five defendants intended to use those weapons in case called upon by Trump to stop the transfer of power to Biden. Rhodes told the jury that wasn\u2019t the case and claimed that the QRF\u2019s were set up at an event the Oath Keepers attended to \u201crespond in case there is an emergency,\u201d including if his men were ever injured. The Oath Keepers also used QRFs every time they provided security, Rhodes said, including several events in Washington, DC. After the election, Rhodes testified he was concerned Antifa would \u201cattack the White House,\u201d and claimed the leftist organization was threatening to \u201cdrag Trump out\u201d if the president refused to concede. In November, \u201cI was concerned that this might actually happen,\u201d Rhodes told the jury, citing his rhetoric on a recorded meeting prosecutors showed the jury in which Rhodes allegedly said that \u201cthere\u2019s going to be a fight.\u201d 'I was acting like a traitor'; second cooperating Oath Keeper testifies in sedition trial If Antifa did try to attack the White House, Rhodes said that \u201cPresident Trump could use the Insurrection Act, declare this an insurrection, and use myself and other veterans to protect the White House.\u201d No such attack at the White House occurred. Rhodes is expected to continue his testimony on Monday.",

Misinformation is trending now that Elon Musk, the self-described \u201cChief Twit,\u201d has bought Twitter, his favorite social media platform. Meanwhile, displays of hate are breaking out in public now that Kanye West, who now goes by Ye, has despicably fashioned himself as a folk hero for those spewing antisemitic messages, pushing his own anti-Jewish conspiracy theories. The stories dovetail not just because they are built on the wild spread of false claims, but also because West\u2019s Twitter account \u2013 locked in early October for an antisemitic tweet in which he said he was going \u201cdeath con 3 on Jewish people\u201d \u2013 was recently reactivated. More on that below. Musk, the world\u2019s richest man, promised to keep Twitter from becoming \u201ca free-for-all hellscape\u201d and said he bought the platform to protect free speech, but over the weekend he grabbed real headlines for sharing fake news. He responded to a tweet from Hillary Clinton in which he linked to a story with made-up accusations about the violent attack on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband, Paul. Read more about Musk\u2019s tweet. Musk later deleted that tweet, but Twitter is crawling with false memes about the attack, as CNN reported Monday. It\u2019s impossible to wade through them. An emergency call taken out of context. An incorrect report about what the suspected attacker was wearing. It all feeds into the silly but specious conspiracy theories that are rampantly circulating, now, it seems, with Musk\u2019s endorsement. Rather than correct the mistake, Musk threw barbs at The New York Times, making a joke about the newspaper and accuracy. Musk\u2019s tweet of the false story joined in with anger from conservatives at the allegation from Clinton and others that violent rhetoric should be associated with the GOP. In her tweet, Clinton had linked to a story from the Los Angeles Times about Pelosi\u2019s alleged attacker and wrote that Republicans should be held accountable for spreading conspiracy theories. Read more on the partisan finger-pointing from CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson, who writes, \u201cRepublicans, while condemning the violence, are denying they have any culpability in fostering a poisoned political environment. Some even used it to pivot to new attempts to sow doubt on the integrity of US elections.\u201d This is a good place to note that pretty much anybody can be fooled by fake news on social media. CNN previously reported on a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2021 that suggested three-quarters of Americans overestimate their ability to spot something fake online. The study involved surveys of 8,200 people and found the more confident a person was that he or she could spot false headlines, the worse that person was at it. \u201cIn all, these results paint a worrying picture: The individuals who are least equipped to identify false news content are also the least aware of their own limitations and, therefore, more susceptible to believing it and spreading it further,\u201d according to the researchers, led by Ben Lyons, a professor of communications at the University of Utah. Republicans, the study noted, have less trust in the media and were more confident in their ability to spot false news than Democrats. The need to verify what you see online is getting ever more important but also harder for users. It\u2019s not just news stories that can be fake. And it\u2019s not just on Twitter. CNN Business has reported on a different study in which researchers submitted blatantly false election-related ads to Facebook, TikTok and YouTube. TikTok approved nearly all the false ads, and Facebook approved a significant portion, according to the report. YouTube, on the other hand, was able to identify the false ads and rejected them.

I asked CNN\u2019s Donie O\u2019Sullivan \u2013 who has for years covered the topic of misinformation and how it spreads online \u2013 how people can protect themselves. \u201cMisinformation is clearly more pronounced on the right and far-right in American life at the moment, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s exclusive to one side of the political spectrum,\u201d he said. \u201cOften we can all be too quick to hit retweet or share on a post that seems to confirm what we want to believe to be true.\u201d I suppose there\u2019s a distinction between straight misinformation and hate, but it is blurred every day. The New York Times noted data from the Anti-Defamation League that shows that antisemitic tweets and language surged after Musk took control of Twitter. The Washington Post also cited data from a group that analyzes social media messages that showed use of the N-word surged since Musk\u2019s takeover \u2013 something the NBA star LeBron James called out on Twitter. \u201cI dont know Elon Musk and, tbh, I could care less who owns twitter.  But I will say that if this is true, I hope he and his people take this very seriously because this is scary AF.  So many damn unfit people saying hate speech is free speech.\u201d Musk responded to James by pointing to a tweet by Twitter\u2019s head of safety and integrity, Yoel Roth, that argued most of the accounts using the N-word were \u201cinauthentic.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve taken action to ban the users involved in this trolling campaign \u2014 and are going to continue working to address this in the days to come to make Twitter safe and welcoming for everyone,\u201d Roth said on the platform. The prevalence of inauthentic Twitter accounts nearly derailed Musk\u2019s purchase of the company. That\u2019s another thing to consider online. Is that viral or provocative post coming from a real person with real thoughts, or from a news organization that verified its reporting? Or is it from a Russian- or Chinese-managed bot? The FBI warned this month that operatives affiliated with both governments are promoting misinformation about the integrity of US elections this year, according to a CNN report. There have been multiple, previous reports about Russia\u2019s effort to exploit underlying racial divisions in the US, something we reported on most recently in June. Musk, in an attempt to make Twitter profitable, is considering charging users for the right to have their account verified, which could actually make it more difficult to know which accounts are real. He\u2019s also promising a new council to review the company\u2019s content moderation policies. He is, however, claiming no part in the reinstatement on Twitter of West, which Musk said was undertaken before he took control of the company. West\u2019s is one of just 124 accounts Musk follows on the platform. While Musk will presumably be asking corporations to advertise on Twitter, West has been excommunicated from his lucrative deals with Adidas and Gap and is no longer being feted on Fox, as he was by Tucker Carlson in early October. Instead of inspiring people to buy sneakers, he\u2019s now inspiring people to unfurl anti-Jewish banners and make Nazi salutes over the 405 freeway in Los Angeles and to project antisemitic messages on a stadium for the Saturday game between the University of Georgia and the University of Florida. West seems to be uncomfortable with that new role. In a long and rambling video posted to YouTube, he said he\u2019s about love, not hate. Per CNN\u2019s report on those comments: \u201cI have no association to any hate group,\u201d West said as he closed his remarks in prayer. \u201cIf any hate happens upon any Jewish person, it is not associated (gestures to himself) because I am demanding that everyone walk in love.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In an ordinary Boston courtroom in April 2015, lawyers and activists at the first hearing of a challenge to race-based admissions practices at Harvard knew they would see each other again, eventually at the US Supreme Court. Attending that preliminary session before US District Judge Allison Burroughs were lawyers from the Consovoy McCarthy law firm and, on the Harvard team, former US solicitor general Seth Waxman. They had been hired at the outset for their expertise as Supreme Court litigators. Private papers reveal the tactics that helped SCOTUS uphold the use of affirmative action Sizing up the affirmative action controversy destined to affect campus diversity nationwide, Burroughs said: \u201cIt is the sort of case that I suspect will ultimately be decided above my pay level.\u201d The Supreme Court will indeed now take it up, on Monday, in one of the most closely watched disputes of the current session. Among those in the spectator seats in April 2015 was Edward Blum, a conservative activist who\u2019d created an entity called Students for Fair Admissions and begun raising millions of dollars from right-wing donors for this broadside against affirmative action at Harvard and, in a case filed simultaneously in November 2014, against the University of North Carolina. Blum had previously enlisted White students to sue over race-based admissions at the University of Texas \u2013 and lost. He added a new dimension to the Harvard case, claiming that high-achieving Asian American applicants were unlawfully disadvantaged by screening policies that favored traditionally underrepresented Blacks and Hispanics. A former stockbroker who never went to law school, Blum, now 70, has a talent for fashioning cases that appeal to the increasingly conservative high court. Using many of the same lawyers over the years, he engineered a series of lawsuits against the 1965 Voting Rights Act culminating in Shelby County v. Holder, the 2013 decision that curtailed the reach of the Voting Rights Act over designated states with a history of discrimination. In the pending effort against affirmative action, Blum\u2019s legal team failed to persuade Burroughs or any of the other lower court judges that heard the challenges that consideration of an applicant\u2019s race, among other criteria, violated federal law or the Constitution. Yet this high court venue now appears more promising to the challengers since the cases were filed nearly eight years ago. The bench is now dominated by six conservatives, with only three liberal justices. The court, which already had demonstrated an aversion to racial remedies, in June showed a startling disregard for precedent when it reversed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that guaranteed a right to abortion nationwide. Students for Fair Admissions wants the justices to throw out Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, the 1978 case that first validated universities\u2019 use of race in determining who was selected for a coveted place on campus, and Grutter v. Bollinger, a significant 2003 decision reinforcing Bakke. The Harvard admissions program was held up as a model in the Bakke case, based on the principle that diversity is essential to the educational mission and that while schools may use race to lift an applicant\u2019s prospects, they may not engage in quotas. SFFA has sued under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits schools receiving federal funds from discriminating based on race, and under the 14th Amendment guarantee of equal protection of the law, which covers state institutions. Lawyers for Harvard and UNC describe race as a \u201cplus\u201d factor, considered along with a student\u2019s academic record and test scores, extracurricular activities and personal attributes. Race shapes one\u2019s life experiences, they say. Back in 2015, Judge Burroughs noted that advocates for Black and Hispanic students were seeking to intervene in the case. The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law argued that a verdict for Students for Fair Admissions would especially disadvantage minority students who\u2019d experienced fewer academic opportunities and that they should be represented at trial. Supreme Court hears arguments on college affirmative action cases \u201cUNC needs race-conscious admissions to achieve the diversity,\u201d David Hinojosa, of the Lawyers\u2019 Committee, wrote in their brief to the Supreme Court, \u201cin part, because of the University\u2019s sordid history of excluding Black applicants well into the twentieth century and its present-day effects, which impede the University\u2019s ability to attract, enroll, and retain Black, Latino, and Native American students, in particular.\u201d Hinojosa added that one student \u201ctestified regarding several confederate relics on UNC\u2019s campus\u201d and said \u201chaving to walk past the \u2018racist wallpaper \u2026 every day adds to that feeling of not being valued \u2026 .\u2019\u201d Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court\u2019s newest member and its first African American female justice, will hear only the UNC dispute, having recused herself from the Harvard case because she previously served on its board of overseers. Blum, whose home is in Penobscot Bay, Maine, has been originating lawsuits against racial policies since the early 1990s when he lived in Houston. After he ran unsuccessfully for the US House of Representatives in Texas, he became part of a group of plaintiffs who sued the state over its congressional district maps. In part to compensate for past discrimination, Texas had created Black-majority and Hispanic-majority districts to increase the chances for minorities to elect a candidate of their choice. The Supreme Court struck down the Texas plan in the 1996 case of Bush v. Vera, finding that the map violated the Constitution\u2019s equal protection guarantee because race was the predominant factor in the map lines, at the expense of traditional districting criteria such as compactness. With the fate of affirmative action in the hands of the Supreme Court, these graduates are fighting to save it Blum turned his attention to higher education in the early 2000s, bringing a case against his alma mater, the University of Texas at Austin, on behalf of Abigail Fisher, a White student denied admission who was also the daughter of a Blum friend. In a CNN interview, Blum described race-based admissions as polarizing. \u201cNo one is suggesting diversity is a bad thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut just treating people differently because of their race and ethnicity, that\u2019s a different element in the quest for diversity.\u201d After two Supreme Court rounds, Fisher lost that case against UT in 2016, as a sharply divided court upheld the principles of Bakke and Grutter, allowing schools to look to race as one criterion among many. \u201cAs this Court has said,\u201d Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, \u201cenrolling a diverse student body \u2018promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial stereotypes, and enables students to better understand persons of different races.\u2019 Equally important, \u2018student body diversity promotes learning outcomes, and better prepares students for an increasingly diverse workforce and society.\u2019\u201d Kennedy has since retired, as has Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, who penned the 2003 Grutter decision. In such racial disputes, no justice has replaced them as a centrist jurist brokering the middle ground. Blum developed the cases against Harvard and the University of North Carolina while the University of Texas lawsuit was ongoing. The Asian American element in the claim against the storied Harvard campus \u2013 emphasized by the challengers as they recall caps on Jewish students at Ivy League institutions decades ago \u2013 has drawn more national attention, compared with the UNC lawsuit. No individual Asian American students were named in the Students for Fair Admissions complaint. Blum attributed that to fears of personal attacks, whether on social media or in person at a campus dormitory. In its filings, Students for Fair Admissions asserted that as Harvard engaged in unlawful \u201cracial balancing,\u201d it held Asian American applicants to higher standards than Black and Latino students. SFFA also contends admissions officers adopted stereotypes as they applied to \u201cpersonal ratings,\u201d categorizing Asian Americans as one-dimensional, lacking leadership qualities and falling short on traits such as \u201clikeability.\u201d After a 15-day trial, Judge Burroughs found no intentional discrimination at Harvard and rejected claims of racial animus. The 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision. In the University of North Carolina case, US District Court Judge Loretta Biggs upheld the schools use of race among many criteria, emphasizing that state institutions of higher education must be \u201copen and available to all segments of our citizenry.\u201d Blum has partnered with William Consovoy and Thomas McCarthy for more than a decade, including in the consequential case of Shelby County v. Holder, which curtailed the reach of the Voting Rights Act over states, mainly in the South, that had a record of electoral discrimination. Before Consovoy and McCarthy founded their own boutique firm in 2014, as the affirmative action cases were being developed, they were part of a larger Washington, DC-based law firm that had represented Blum back in the 1990s. To pay the legal fees, Blum has collected millions of dollars from conservative benefactors through Donors Trust, which raises tax-exempt funds and channels them to various projects. Consovoy, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas who appeared before Burroughs from the start in 2015 and argued the SFFA appeal at the 1st Circuit in 2020, is currently being treated for brain cancer. Another partner, Cameron Norris, also a former Thomas clerk, will represent SFFA in the Harvard case on Monday. Waxman will be back at the lectern for Harvard. In the UNC case, Patrick Strawbridge, another former Thomas clerk at Consovoy McCarthy, will represent SFFA, and North Carolina state solicitor general Ryan Park, a former law clerk to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, will appear for the university. Consovoy McCarthy, often taking the helm in ideologically driven cases, represented then-president Donald Trump as he lodged election-related lawsuits in multiple states before the November 2020 presidential contest. At the same time, Waxman, who was US solicitor general during the Clinton administration and is now in private practice at WilmerHale, was one of three former Democratic solicitors general who worked behind the scenes on a legal plan to counteract claims by Trump and other Republicans. Joining the veterans in the case will be current US solicitor general, Elizabeth Prelogar, siding with the universities on behalf of the Biden administration. (The Trump administration had earlier backed Students for Fair Admissions.) Prelogar, who held consecutive clerkships for Ginsburg then Justice Elena Kagan, will present arguments in both cases Monday, highlighting the importance of diversity in higher education at West Point and other military academies. \u201cThe Nation\u2019s military leaders,\u201d she wrote in a brief, \u201chave learned through hard experience that the effectiveness of our military depends on a diverse officer corps that is ready to lead an increasingly diverse fighting force.\u201d Blum, who insists that any policy of diversity based on race is wrong, will be in the spectator section of the courtroom on Monday. He hopes that the high court is now ready to end the use of race in admissions, yet he adds with some caution, \u201cAfter working on eight Supreme Court cases, I\u2019ve learned that litigants can be very surprised\u201d at a final decision.",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama on Saturday sought to sway voters who are worried about inflation, warning in two key Midwestern states that Republicans seeking control of Congress have no plans to rein in prices and could target social safety net programs. Campaigning alongside Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Detroit, and later Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers and Democratic Senate nominee Mandela Barnes in Milwaukee, Obama acknowledged the economic realities Americans face. But he said handing power on Capitol Hill to the GOP would do little to solve those problems. \u201cIn your gut, you should have a sense: Who cares about you?\u201d he said in Wisconsin.   In a moment that rapidly spread across social media, Obama lambasted Barnes\u2019 opponent, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who is seeking a third term. He cited Johnson\u2019s past comments comparing the management of Social Security to a \u201cPonzi scheme\u201d and criticized Johnson\u2019s vote for the 2017 GOP-led tax overhaul. \u201cSome of you here are on Social Security. Some of your parents are on Social Security. Some of your grandparents are on Social Security. You know why they have Social Security?\u201d Obama said. \u201cBecause they worked for it. They worked hard jobs for it. They have chapped hands for it. They had long hours and sore backs and bad knees to get that Social Security.\u201d \u201cAnd if Ron Johnson does not understand that \u2013 if he understands giving tax breaks for private planes more than he understands making sure that seniors who\u2019ve worked all their lives are able to retire with dignity and respect \u2013 he\u2019s not the person who\u2019s thinking about you and knows you and sees you, and he should not be your senator from Wisconsin,\u201d the former President said. Obama is traveling to some of the most important midterm battlegrounds in the days before the November 8 midterm elections. In addition to the stops in Michigan and Wisconsin, Obama also held an event Friday in Georgia. He will visit Nevada on Tuesday and then hold multiple events in Pennsylvania alongside President Joe Biden on Saturday. All five states feature hotly contested governor\u2019s races, and all but Michigan also have Senate contests that will play a role in determining which party controls the evenly divided chamber. The former President on Saturday portrayed the modern GOP as unserious and uncompromising, describing the party \u2013 with few exceptions \u2013 as beholden to former President Donald Trump\u2019s whims. \u201cOwn the libs and getting Donald Trump\u2019s approval. That\u2019s their agenda,\u201d Obama said in Milwaukee. \u201cThey\u2019re not interested in solving problems. They\u2019re interested in making you angry, and then finding somebody to blame,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re hoping that\u2019ll distract you from the fact that they don\u2019t have any answers of their own.\u201d Obama\u2019s message mirrored Biden\u2019s insistence that Republicans have not offered proposals to rein in inflation and his warnings that GOP congressional majorities would target popular safety net programs like Social Security and Medicare. Bill Clinton goes to bat for endangered chair of House Democrats' campaign arm It also echoed what former President Bill Clinton said at a campaign stop for Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney in New York on Saturday. Clinton said that the GOP\u2019s midterm slogan should be: \u201cThis is a real problem. Let\u2019s vote for somebody who will make it worse.\u201d The difference is location: Obama is hitting the campaign trail in places other Democrats can\u2019t visit without provoking costly political backlash. Biden, whose approval rating is underwater in CNN polls conducted by SSRS across key midterm states, is largely limiting his role to fundraisers, though he will travel to Pennsylvania \u2013 his state of birth \u2013 in the election\u2019s closing weekend. Other figures, such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, can energize progressives but have limited appeal beyond core supporters. Obama, though, remains a national Democratic figure who can motivate the party\u2019s base while also appealing to moderate voters. Obama described inflation as a global challenge that resulted from a coronavirus pandemic that \u201cthrew off supply and demand,\u201d as well as Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, which he said has driven up gas prices. \u201cWhen gas prices go up, when grocery prices go up, that takes a bite out of people\u2019s paycheck. That hurts,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut the question you should be asking is: Who\u2019s going to do something about it? Republicans are having a field day running ads talking about it, but what is their actual solution to it?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell you: They want to gut Social Security, then Medicare, and then give some more tax breaks to the wealthy,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the reason I know that\u2019s their agenda is, listen, that\u2019s their answer to everything.\u201d That theme \u2013 that Republicans have lost interest in compromising, keeping the government running or even acknowledging basic realities, including the outcome of the 2020 presidential election \u2013 echoed through Obama\u2019s remarks in Michigan and Wisconsin. Gone were the days of former first lady Michelle Obama\u2019s insistence that \u201cwhen they go low, we go high.\u201d Obama acknowledged Saturday that his wife is discouraged by today\u2019s political landscape. \u201cI\u2019m usually a little more optimistic,\u201d he said in Michigan. He contrasted the moment the United States now faces with the early stages of his own political career. He described losing a 2000 effort to unseat incumbent Rep. Bobby Rush in a Democratic primary \u2013 the only time Obama was defeated at the ballot box. \u201cYou know what I didn\u2019t do, though? I didn\u2019t claim the election was rigged. I didn\u2019t try to stop votes from being counted. I didn\u2019t incite a mob to storm the Capitol,\u201d Obama said in Detroit. \u201cI took my lumps. I figured out why my campaign hadn\u2019t connected, and I tried to run a better race the next time, because that\u2019s how our democracy is supposed to work.\u201d Obama in Georgia lambasts Walker as 'a celebrity that wants to be a politician' Obama described driving around Illinois as a Senate candidate in 2004, meeting people at diners in conservative areas of the state and having cordial conversations. He pointed to the example of the late Arizona Sen. John McCain, who delivered a gracious concession speech after losing the 2008 presidential election to Obama. And he said that while he didn\u2019t like the outcome of the 2016 presidential race, he stayed up until 3 a.m. to call Trump and congratulate him, and proceed with a peaceful transfer of power. In Milwaukee, Obama even joked about birtherism \u2013 the racist conspiracy theory fueled by Trump that Obama was not born in the United States. Obama compared himself to Barnes, saying the Senate nominee, who is also Wisconsin lieutenant governor, faces a barrage of Republican ads portraying him as out of touch with the state\u2019s values \u201cjust because Mandela\u2019s named Mandela; just because he\u2019s a Democrat with a funny name.\u201d \u201cIt sounds pretty familiar, doesn\u2019t it? So Mandela,\u201d Obama said, turning to Barnes onstage, \u201cget ready to dig up that birth certificate.\u201d \u201cRemember when that was the craziest thing people said? That wasn\u2019t that long ago. People were like, \u2018Wow, that was some crazy stuff,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow, it doesn\u2019t even make the top 10 list of crazy.\u201d Obama saved his sharpest criticism for Johnson, saying the GOP senator had a \u201cgold medal\u201d in trafficking conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. In remarks earlier this month, Johnson appeared to downplay the violence from the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol and noted that the rioters \u201cdid teach us how you can use flagpoles, that kind of stuff, as weapons.\u201d A campaign spokesperson later said the senator\u2019s comments were meant to compare the methods used by racial justice protesters in the summer of 2020 with the January 6 rioters. Obama warns of 'malevolence' aimed at democracy in Democratic fundraiser speech In a debate with Barnes in October, Johnson said, \u201cI immediately and forcefully and repeatedly condemned the violence on January 6.\u201d In Michigan, Obama warned that a \u201cdangerous climate\u201d was developing as a result of incendiary rhetoric in the United States \u2013 \u201cwhen we don\u2019t just disagree with people, but we start demonizing them making wild crazy allegations about them.\u201d \u201cIf elected officials don\u2019t do more to explicitly reject that kind of rhetoric, if they tacitly support or encourage their supporters to stand up outside voting places armed with guns dressed in tactical gear, more people can get hurt,\u201d Obama said. In a moment Obama used as an exclamation point for his comments about the direction of the GOP, a protester in the audience interrupted him by shouting. That prompted the former President to respond, \u201cSo, this is this is what I\u2019m saying.\u201d \u201cThere is a process that we set up in our democracy right now. I\u2019m talking, you\u2019ll have a chance to talk sometime,\u201d he said to the protester. \u201cAnd this is part of the point that I want to make: Just basic civility and courtesy works, and that\u2019s what we want to try to encourage.\u201d The protester was quickly drowned out by chants of \u201cObama!\u201d from the crowd. CNN\u2019s Donald Judd, Omar Jimenez and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Tom Nelson can hardly believe it. In just a matter of two months, Democrats went from expecting to knock off the unpopular GOP incumbent, US Sen. Ron Johnson, to seeing their party\u2019s nominee, Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, scrambling to catch up. Already, the finger pointing has begun. \u201cThe national party did him a grave disservice by not closing the gap, by not being a stopgap measure in August and September to hit Johnson hard on good, effective negative ads, at the same time building up Mandela,\u201d Nelson, a local county executive from central Wisconsin and former Senate Democratic candidate, told CNN. \u201cThe national party has totally failed us, and so it\u2019s gonna come down to Wisconsin Democrats.\u201d Of possibly seeing Johnson, 67, win a third Senate race, Nelson said, \u201cPeople are just hitting their heads against the wall. How do we let this happen?\u201d   Over the summer, Barnes\u2019 top Democratic opponents dropped out, clearing the way for him to win the primary and fully shift to attacking Johnson. Yet Barnes\u2019 slim lead collapsed in September, when Republicans spent nearly $6 million more than Democrats on the air slamming Barnes primarily on crime. In August, a Marquette Law School poll of likely voters showed Barnes leading Johnson 52-45. By early October, those numbers reversed. What\u2019s happening in Wisconsin resembles Democratic struggles across the country. They\u2019ve seen their leads evaporate in key House and Senate races as outside money floods in to hammer Democrats over crime and inflation, while they\u2019ve tried to rail against Republicans over their opposition to abortion rights. In several key battleground states \u2013 Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Florida \u2013 GOP candidates and groups spent roughly $25 million more than their Democratic counterparts on air in September alone, according to data from AdImpact, which tracks ad spending. In states like Wisconsin, the outside money has forced Barnes to go on defense, and air several ads accusing Johnson of lying in the attack ads. Many of his supporters believe that is not enough. \u201cOh, I\u2019m terrified,\u201d said Mary Hildebrand, a voter here in this small northern Wisconsin town. \u201cHis campaign seems to be faltering,\u201d she said of Barnes. In an interview, Barnes dismissed the polls showing him down in the race. Democrats are heartened that the same Marquette pollster tested a larger universe of voters \u2013 registered voters \u2013 and found the race there essentially a dead heat. \u201cPolls go up, polls go down,\u201d Barnes, 35, told CNN. \u201cThe reality is we\u2019re showing up, talking to everybody.\u201d \u201cAll they can do is try to distort my record and try to make people live in fear,\u201d he added, rejecting the notion that he was caught flat-footed. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what this is about. It\u2019s about making sure that people know better is possible.\u201d Democrats have already reserved $2 million more in ads than Republicans in the final three weeks of the campaign, according to AdImpact. And officials with Democratic outside groups \u2013 namely the Senate Majority PAC and Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee \u2013 reject the criticism that their ad campaigns have been ineffective. \u201cWisconsin is one of the top Senate battlegrounds because voters in the state are tired of Ron Johnson looking out for himself at their expense,\u201d said Amanda Sherman Baity, a spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which has ramped up its spending since the August 9 primary and has spent over $4.8 million in the race so far, including a $1 million ad buy coordinated with the Barnes campaign. Senate Majority PAC, the super PAC aligned with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, and its affiliated group have been on the air since May, having dropped $22 million in the state, with $6.2 million planned in the final three weeks. \u201cWe have just under three weeks left to defeat Johnson and defend our Democratic Senate majority\u2014that\u2019s what we\u2019re focusing on, and we strongly encourage our fellow Democrats to do the same,\u201d said Senate Majority PAC spokesperson Veronica Yoo. On the air, Republicans have had a near singular focus, hammering Barnes for violent crime and for previously advocating for shifting police funding to other social services in the community. Outside groups like Wisconsin Truth PAC and the Senate Leadership Fund, the super PAC aligned with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, have said he supports \u201cdefunding\u201d the police, a slogan he rejects. Of the GOP attacks, Marilyn Norden, a voter in northern Wisconsin, said: \u201cThey seem to be working. Yes, I\u2019m very concerned.\u201d After a speech at a packed diner here in Oneida County, Barnes defended himself, telling reporters that the issue is personal for him since he\u2019s lost friends to gun violence. He said he wants \u201cfully funded\u201d schools and \u201cgood-paying jobs,\u201d and to prevent \u201cdangerous weapons\u201d from getting in the hands of criminals. He said that Johnson \u201cis only playing politics with our safety.\u201d \u201cNobody is asking about interviews from six years ago, people are asking why Ron Johnson continues to leave them behind,\u201d he told CNN when asked about recent reports he spoke out against police brutality on RT, a Kremlin-backed network, in 2015 and 2016. Barnes is attempting to be the first Black person to become a US senator from Wisconsin, and his supporters see a racial component to the attacks. \u201cThese ads have gone from crime ads to just blatant racism,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThis is something that Wisconsin has never seen before.\u201d Barnes\u2019 attacks have mostly focused on the accusations that Johnson enriched himself while in office, an accusation the GOP senator rejects, and over his support for banning abortion. Asked why he hasn\u2019t focused on other issues during his paid media campaign \u2013 namely Johnson\u2019s downplaying of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and sowing doubt over the Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 Barnes said there was plenty of controversy to choose from. \u201cWe actually have focused on January 6th to an extent, but the reality is there are many different fronts to address Ron Johnson\u2019s failures,\u201d Barnes told CNN. \u201cAnd it\u2019s important for us to highlight where Ron Johnson has failed people right at home and at the dinner table.\u201d Johnson has remained behind closed doors this week. His campaign refused to disclose his campaign schedule this week or make him available for an interview. But he has appeared on Fox this week, including pleading for donations during an appearance on Sean Hannity\u2019s show Tuesday night. The Barnes and Johnson campaigns have each spent over $23 million so far on the race, but the lieutenant governor outraised the senator last quarter, $19.5 million to $11.6 million. \u201cI think so many people think this is won,\u201d Johnson said to Hannity. \u201cMy fundraising is weaker. I rely on your audience.\u201d There are signs that Democrats are broadening their attacks. The Senate Majority PAC and End Citizens United launched Wednesday a new ad featuring a retired Madison police officer calling out Johnson for describing the January 6 attack on the Capitol as largely a \u201cpeaceful protest.\u201d On Tuesday, SMP aired another ad attacking Johnson on China, for working to sweeten a tax break for companies connected to his donors and himself, and for his anti-abortion rights position.   At a speech here on Tuesday, Barnes attacked Johnson for not supporting federal legislation to codify same-sex marriage, for at one point facilitating an effort to contest the 2020 election and for later downplaying the January 6 riot. Johnson\u2019s supporters in the ultimate swing state have twice sent him to the Senate, drawn to his brash attitude, businessman background and conservative values. The Wisconsin Republican has also benefited from running in election cycles when the political environment favored his party, first in the 2010 tea party wave, then in 2016 as Donald Trump stunned the world and narrowly took Wisconsin on his way to the White House, and now in 2022, when inflation and a deteriorating economy threatens Democrats\u2019 control of Congress. Andy Loduha, Republican party chairman here in Oneida County, said Barnes doesn\u2019t understand the economic issues that have come to the forefront of the race. \u201cI think abortion is another example of how the Democrats don\u2019t really have anything to run on,\u201d said Loduha. \u201cThey\u2019re running on emotional issues like abortion, but they don\u2019t want to try to touch inflation, crime, drugs.\u201d Wisconsin Democratic strategist Joe Zepecki is frustrated with the Democratic bedwetting, even though he said recognized the \u201ctough national political environment.\u201d \u201cI just think there\u2019s too many Democrats wringing their hands and thinking this thing is like gone or on its way to being gone,\u201d Zepecki said. \u201cGuys, run through the tape. You\u2019re right there, despite the f***ing onslaught that Barnes had to weather \u2026 And he\u2019s still right there.\u201d Asked if she believed Barnes would win, Wisconsin Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, who ran against Barnes before dropping out, told CNN, \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we know about Wisconsin, it\u2019s we live by close elections, and we never press our luck.\u201d To get there, Barnes will be campaigning next week in Milwaukee with former President Barack Obama, in a bid to energize voters. But there are no plans yet to campaign with the current President, Joe Biden, whose unpopularity remains a liability here. Asked if Biden should run for reelection, Barnes told CNN: \u201cWe\u2019ll cross that bridge when we get there. We still gotta get through November 8, 2022.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer, Ted Barrett and David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Lawyer William Consovoy, who has shepherded the challenges to race-based affirmative action at Harvard and the University of North Carolina since they were filed in 2014, will not be at the lectern for the culminating Supreme Court round on October 31. Consovoy is being treated for brain cancer, his law partner Thomas McCarthy told CNN. Consovoy argued against Harvard\u2019s admissions practices in a lower US appeals court in September 2020 and has been a prominent attorney on conservative social causes. He also represented former President Donald Trump in multiple state election law disputes leading up to Election Day in November 2020. The Consovoy McCarthy firm recently informed the Supreme Court that Cameron Norris will argue on behalf of the challengers, Students for Fair Admissions, against Harvard. Another lawyer with the firm, Patrick Strawbridge, is scheduled to argue the separate University of North Carolina case. Consovoy, Norris and Strawbridge are all former law clerks to Justice Clarence Thomas, who with other justices on the right wing opposes campus affirmative action and other policies that take account of an individual\u2019s race. Thomas has argued that they violate the Constitution\u2019s equal protection guarantee and end up stigmatizing the people they were intended to benefit. The twin lawsuits against an elite private campus and prestigious state university could lead the increasingly conservative Supreme Court to overhaul campus admissions nationwide. The litigation was designed to obtain reversal of a 1978 Supreme Court landmark that first allowed students\u2019 race to be considered as a factor, with academic and extracurricular criteria, to ensure campus diversity. That case, Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, was affirmed by the justices in a 2003 case from the University of Michigan, Grutter v. Bollinger. The Bakke precedent has enhanced the educational opportunities for Blacks, Hispanics and other racial minorities for decades, as it has remained a flashpoint. Lower court judges spurned the claims against Harvard and UNC, relying on the established precedents, but the current 6-3, conservative-liberal high court is likely to be more receptive to the challengers. Consovoy and McCarthy created their original two-person firm after leaving a large Washington practice about eight years ago. It has grown to twenty lawyers, many who\u2019ve arrived from clerkships with conservative justices and lower court judges. Norris, 14 years younger than the 48-year-old Consovoy, has appeared before the nine justices once before. He argued a 2020 tax case, CIC Services v. Internal Revenue Service. That same year, he defended Trump in financial-documents litigation with the US House of Representatives, Trump v. Mazars, in federal appellate court. Norris has also represented the Republican National Committee. McCarthy declined to offer details of Consovoy\u2019s cancer but said it was first diagnosed about two years ago. He said Consovoy plans to listen to an audio livestream of the arguments from his Virginia home on October 31. How the Supreme Court's liberal justices sought to shape voting-rights arguments For more than a decade, Consovoy and McCarthy have been part of the litigation teams hired by conservative activist Edward Blum, who created the Students for Fair Admissions group that is attempting to end any consideration of race in admissions screening. Blum separately engineered lawsuits over the 1965 Voting Rights Act, including the litigation that led, in 2013, to Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted a portion of the milestone law that had required localities with a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing their electoral practices. In the upcoming affirmative action showdown, Seth Waxman, a former US solicitor general now in private practice, will be at the lectern for Harvard. North Carolina state solicitor general Ryan Park will represent the state university.",

            "article_content": "In key races across the country, the electorate is continuing to divide along the demographic and generational lines that have left the two parties in rough parity for years \u2013 limiting each side\u2019s ability to score unexpected breakthroughs or to amass sweeping gains in November. A wide array of public polls shows that in key contests, voters are aligning between Republican and Democratic candidates in remarkably similar patterns, with only very few exceptions. Almost all major contested statewide races are being defined by a huge gender gap that could prove even larger than in the past several elections. Voters in races almost everywhere are also sharply dividing along lines of education and generation. And while the gap in partisan preferences between Whites and voters of color may narrow somewhat from recent experience, the racial contrast in support for the parties remains stark as well. \u201cThese cleavages are everywhere,\u201d says Democratic strategist Celinda Lake, who served as a lead pollster for President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign.   Because so many contested races are so close, even small shifts in attitudes among these different groups still could tilt most of the toss-up races toward one side and provide them a clear victory. As the party out of the White House during a period of economic dissatisfaction, history suggests the GOP is clearly best positioned to benefit if any such late movement develops among voters. But it appears at least as likely that these deeply etched divisions will produce a result that again leaves the eventual winner clinging to only narrow majorities in the House and Senate. A closely split result would underscore how difficult it will be for either party to break out of their bitter current stalemate. Amid the worst pandemic in a century, and widespread discontent over Donald Trump\u2019s performance and priorities as president, Democrats anticipated sweeping gains in the 2020 election. But then they unexpectedly lost seats in the House and failed to capture several Senate seats they believed within reach even as Biden won the White House. Now, even amid the worst inflation 40 years, the original Republican expectations from last spring of a towering \u201cred wave\u201d in congressional and gubernatorial races may prove equally illusory, even if Republicans remained favored to flip control of the House. If the demographic, generational and geographic alignments within the electorate on display again this year cannot be dislodged by events as momentous as a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, or once-in-a generation inflation, or a Supreme Court decision overturning of the 50-year constitutional right to abortion, it is not clear what can reconfigure them. The real signal from this year\u2019s election may be that American politics is fated for years to remain caught on what UCLA political scientist Lynn Vavreck calls \u201cthe knife\u2019s edge\u201d between two increasingly divergent, and even hostile, political coalitions. Glen Bolger, a veteran Republican pollster, for instance, says flatly, \u201cI would be shocked to see a 52-48 Senate either way.\u201d Indeed, many analysts in both parties believe the most likely outcome next month may be a Senate again divided exactly 50-50 between the parties \u2013 something that has not happened in two consecutive elections since the direct election of senators began just before World War I. Even if Republicans take the House, it now appears likely they will hold a smaller, and more fractious, majority than seemed probable earlier this year; if Democrats defy the odds to defend their already-slim majority, their margin almost certainly will be historically tiny. The demographic divergences between the two coalitions this year begin with gender. The \u201cgender gap\u201d \u2013 the tendency of women to vote relatively more for Democrats, or alternately, for men to vote relatively more for Republicans \u2013 has been a widely discussed feature of American politics since 1984, but it could loom especially large this year. The major data sources studying how Americans vote \u2013 including the Edison Research exit polls conducted for a media consortium that includes CNN, the Pew Research Center\u2019s Validated Voters study and the projections by Catalist, a Democratic voter targeting firm \u2013 generally agree that in the 2018 House elections and the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns, Democrats won most women and lost most men (Pew had the two sides splitting men evenly in 2018.) Overall, these sources determined Democrats ran about 13 percentage points better among women than men in 2016 (when Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton was the first female major party presidential nominee) and around 8-12 points better in 2018 and 2020. If the trends now evident in polls persist through Election Day, the gender gap this year will likely land toward the higher end of that scale. The latest CNN national survey conducted by SSRS found Democrats winning 60% of the two-party vote among women on the \u201cgeneric\u201d congressional ballot and just 43% of the two-party vote among men. Other recent generic surveys from CBS and Fox News have shown a smaller gender gap, though also with Democrats winning among women but losing among men. AARP, the giant lobby for seniors, has contracted with the firms headed by the lead pollsters in 2020 for Trump (Fabrizio Ward) and Biden (Impact Research) to conduct surveys across the major Senate and governor races \u2013 an ambitious project that has produced the most comprehensive set of publicly available surveys conducted with the same methodology. In the seven major competitive Senate races the two firms have polled, Republicans led among men in every state, and Democrats led among women in every state except Wisconsin. (The Democratic lead with women was also very narrow in Florida.) Recent statewide polls by the non-partisan Marist Institute for Public Opinion at Marist College likewise showed Democrats holding at least an eleven-point lead, and often much more than that, among women in the Senate races in Colorado, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Georgia. Republicans led among men in each of those contests except for Arizona (where the Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is a former astronaut) and Pennsylvania (where Democratic nominee John Fetterman, the lieutenant governor, has a brusque blue-collar style.) The latest CNN polls in Arizona and Nevada showed Kelly and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, respectively, holding double digit leads among women, but trailing among men \u2013 Kelly narrowly and Masto by a crushing twenty-point margin. In the CNN polls, the two genders sharply divided in the Arizona and Nevada gubernatorial races as well. Powerful forces this year are driving apart the preferences of men and women. Most surveys show that the decision by the Republican-appointed majority on the Supreme Court to revoke the nearly 50-year constitutional right to the procedure is more important as a voting issue to women than men. With men, inflation outstrips any other concern in most polls, such as a recent national NPR/Marist poll. The persistence and severity of the gender gap has prompted Lake to formulate a simple rule: Democrats win when they can amass a margin among women (who tend to cast a majority of the votes in most states) at least as great as the GOP advantage among men. The generation gap is another thread through these polls. With only occasional exceptions, Democrats consistently run better with younger than older voters. That advantage is greatest among the youngest voters aged 18-29, but now frequently extends to voters in their early 40s, the oldest Millennials. Democrats have been consistently weakest among voters in the later stages of their working careers \u2013 roughly from 45-65 \u2013 before recovering in several states to post more competitive numbers among seniors aged 65 or older, who are sensitive to Democratic appeals on Social Security, Medicare and reducing prescription drug costs, as the AARP surveys show. Education looms as potentially the most important cleavage this year. \u201cWhen you combine across nine different polls in battleground states, the education gap is almost 3 times the size of the age gap and ten points bigger than the gender gap, so I absolutely think it\u2019s going to be a significant predictor in these races,\u201d says Matt Hogan, a partner at Impact Research, the Democratic half of the bipartisan AARP polling team. Looking across racial lines, the major data sources on recent voting behavior generally found Democrats winning around 60% of all voters holding at least a four-year college degree in both 2020 and 2018, and just slightly less than that in 2016. Democrats again drew support from almost exactly three-fifths of those college graduates in the two-party \u201cgeneric\u201d ballot test in the most recent CNN national poll, although some other generic polls have shown a narrower edge. In the AARP, CNN and Marist surveys Democrats seem on track to reach that threshold as well in Senate races in such states as New Hampshire, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Colorado, plus in governor races in Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. (A notable exception: the CNN poll showed Masto narrowly losing college graduates in Nevada.) Republicans have been stronger among voters without a college degree. Looking across racial lines, the GOP narrowly carried most of those voters in both 2018 and 2020 and won them by a bigger margin in 2016. Their advantage is, of course, especially pronounced among White voters without a college degree, who have transformed since the 1960s from the backbone of the Democratic coalition to the foundation of the Republican electorate. In 2020, Biden won just about one-third of those working-class Whites, up slightly from Hillary Clinton\u2019s historically anemic total in 2016, but down a bit from the party\u2019s showing in 2018. The latest CNN poll on congressional preferences showed Democrats this year again stuck at about one-third support from Whites without a college degree. State polls show some individual Senate candidates running slightly better than that, including Fetterman in Pennsylvania and Rep. Tim Ryan in the Ohio Senate race. But it\u2019s common in these surveys to find the GOP candidate winning 60% or more among these working-class Whites. The same divergence in priorities that is sustaining the gender gap is also contributing to the educational chasm. For working-class voters, who often operate with smaller economic margins, inflation is a pervasive and biting daily challenge; for white-collar college-educated voters, it is often more of an inconvenience. That frees relatively more college-educated adults to vote on the issues around abortion rights and preserving democracy that favor Democrats. As I\u2019ve written, the central tension that could decide next month\u2019s election is how many voters prioritize economic issues and how many stress abortion rights and democracy, a balance likely to vary from state to state. Tony Fabrizio, Trump\u2019s lead pollster in 2020 and the Republican half of the AARP team, says that while abortion has helped Democrats both motivate their voters and define their Republican opponents, in the campaign\u2019s final weeks \u201cI think we are seeing a shift away from that, and back toward economics, which benefits Republicans.\u201d These effects compound each other. For years, white men without a college degree have been the GOP\u2019s strongest demographic group: Republicans carried about two-thirds (or more) of them in both 2018 and 2020, and the CNN poll shows the party positioned to match or even slightly exceed that in the congressional vote this year, according to detailed results provided by the CNN polling unit. In the latest Marist and CNN Senate polls, Democratic nominees have rarely reached even 35% of the vote with these men. Conversely, college-educated White women have evolved into a core Democratic group: most sources showed Democrats winning about 60% of them in both 2018 and 2020, and the CNN poll showed the party slightly exceeding that level in this year\u2019s congressional vote. The Marist and CNN polls show Democratic Senate candidates around or above that level in every major Senate race except Georgia (a Southern state where more White voters of every variety tend to lean right.) The stark polarity between these two groups have led Bolger, the Republican pollster, to develop a yardstick that\u2019s a variation on Lake\u2019s theme: he believes Republicans are favored in any race where their margins and turnout from non-college men of all races surpasses the Democratic advantage among college-educated women of all races. Generation also influences gender. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling overturning abortion rights has turbocharged support for Democrats among younger women, a group that already leaned toward the party. \u201cYounger women are very engaged and very fearful and angry about the court\u2019s decision: they are the most Democratic- voting group bar none,\u201d says Katherine Spillar, executive director of the Feminist Majority Foundation, a liberal group that on Monday released an extensive study about the gender gap. The equation is more complicated among older White women, particularly the large number of them without a college education, says Lake, who conducted the polling for the foundation\u2019s study. They also tend to support abortion rights, she says, but they are less likely than younger and college-educated women to prioritize it above inflation in their vote. \u201cYou are not going to get non-college educated women if you don\u2019t have both an economic conversation with them and a Roe v. Wade conversation, particularly with the older end of them,\u201d Lake said. Lake believes non-college educated White women of every age may be the critical swing voters in this election, a verdict Bolger also leans toward. In the CNN poll, Democrats were winning only about one-third of them for Congress, somewhat less than the party\u2019s showing in 2020 and considerably less than its strength in 2018. Gender and education also intersect meaningfully with race. Latino men, especially those without a college education, have become much more of a swing group open to voting for Republicans; to a lesser extent, so have Black men. Democratic support among all voters of color slipped from slightly more than three-fourths in 2018 to just under three-fourths in 2020. One of the decisive variables this year may be whether Republicans can extend those gains, particularly among male and non-college minority voters. Fabrizio predicts they will, based primarily on frustration over the economy. Hogan, the Democratic pollster, worries that he may be right. \u201cWe are seeing a continuation of\u201d the GOP\u2019s 2020 gains, he said, \u201cboth among Latinos and among Black voters as well\u2026that is primarily driven by concerns about the economy.\u201d With inflation this high that seems entirely possible. But large-sample surveys of Latino voters by The Washington Post/Ipsos and the Pew Research Center have not yet found evidence of big Republican inroads: each survey found Democrats holding more than three-fifths of the two party vote among Latino voters, less than earlier in this century but almost exactly their level in 2020. Nor did the Post/Ipsos poll find evidence of GOP improvement with male or non-college Latinos. Still even small Latino shifts could threaten Democrats in closely contested states. Nevada, where many Latinos have been squeezed first by both the COVID-related shutdowns in the gambling industry and then by inflation, may be the state where economic discontent among those voters most threatens Democratic prospects. This latticework of allegiances has produced a political system in which neither side has lastingly sustained an advantage over the other, arguably since the late 1960s. This year, Democrats will need to defy history and political gravity to avoid significant losses at a moment of such widespread economic discontent. But the persistence and pervasiveness of these demographic divides in races around the country suggests that whichever side ultimately controls the House and Senate, this year\u2019s fiercely fought campaign will not move us very far off of that \u201cknife\u2019s edge.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams sparred over health care, crime and punishment, and voting rights in a Monday debate as they made their closing arguments to voters in a reprise of their fiercely contested 2018 race for the same job. The stakes for this night were arguably higher for Abrams, who has trailed in most recent polling of the race. Kemp, one of the few prominent Republicans to resist former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about a stolen election in 2020, has positioned himself as a more traditional, pro-business conservative \u2013 a tack that his gentle resistance to Trump reinforced with swing voters. Abrams has argued that Kemp shouldn\u2019t get any special credit for doing his job and not breaking the law.   Kemp and Abrams were joined by Libertarian nominee Shane Hazel, who took shots at both his opponents and plainly stated his desire to send the election to a run-off. (If no one receives a clear majority on Election Day, the top two finishers advance to a one-on-one contest.) But it was the two major party candidates, who ran tight campaigns four years ago with Kemp emerging the narrow victor, who dominated the debate stage. Their disagreements were pointed, as they were in 2018, their attacks and rebuttals well-rehearsed and, to a large degree, predictable. Here are the four main takeaways from the Georgia governor\u2019s debate: Like Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker did in his debate with Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock last week, Kemp took every opportunity \u2013 and when they weren\u2019t there, tried anyway \u2013 to connect Abrams to Biden, who, despite winning the state in 2020, is a deeply unpopular figure there now. Early voting begins in Georgia with slate of key races on the ballot \u201cI would remind you that Stacey Abrams campaigned to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate,\u201d Kemp said, referring to the chatter around Abrams potentially being chosen as his running mate two years ago. During an exchange with the moderators about abortion, Kemp pivoted to the economy \u2013 and again, invoked Biden and Democrats on Capitol Hill. \u201cGeorgians should know that my desire is to continue to help them fight through 40-year high inflation and high gas prices and other things that our Georgia families are facing right now, quite honestly, because of bad policies in Washington, DC, from President Biden and the Democrats that have complete control,\u201d he said. Abrams, unlike so many other Democrats running this year, has not sought to distance herself from the President and recently said publicly that she would welcome him in Georgia. First lady Jill Biden visited last week for an Abrams fundraiser, where she criticized Kemp over his position on abortion as well as his refusal to expand Medicaid and voting rights. Early on in the night, Kemp was questioned about remarks he made \u2013 taped without his knowledge \u2013 at a tailgate with University of Georgia College Republicans in which he expressed some openness to a push to ban contraceptive drugs like \u201cPlan B.\u201d   Asked if he would pursue such legislation if reelected, Kemp said, \u201cNo, I would not\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s not my desire to\u201d push further abortion restrictions, before pivoting to an attack on Biden, national Democrats and more talk about his economic record. Pressed on the remarks, Kemp suggested he was just humoring a group of people he didn\u2019t know. On the tape, Kemp, though he didn\u2019t seem enthusiastic, said, \u201cYou could take up pretty much everything, but you\u2019ve got to be in legislative session to do that.\u201d When asked if it was something he could do, Kemp said, \u201cIt just depends on where the legislators are,\u201d and that he\u2019d \u201chave to check and see because there are a lot of legalities.\u201d Georgia in 2019 passed and Kemp signed a so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill, which bans abortions at around six weeks, and went into effect soon after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v. Wade. Before the ruling, abortion was legal in the state until 20 weeks into pregnancy. Abrams has promised to work to \u201creverse\u201d the law, though she would face significant headwinds in the GOP-controlled state legislature, and called the state law \u201ccruel.\u201d One of the first questions posed to Abrams centered on her speech effectively \u2013 but not with the precise language \u2013 conceding the 2018 election to Kemp. In those remarks, Abrams made a symbolic point in arguing that she was not conceding the contest, because Kemp, as the state\u2019s top elections official, and his allies had unfairly worked to suppress the vote. Instead, Abrams said then, she would only \u201cacknowledge\u201d him as the winner. Five takeaways from the second Ohio Senate debate Some Republicans have tried to make hay over the speech, in a measure of whataboutism usually attached to Trump\u2019s refusal to accept the 2020 results. Abrams, apart from a court challenge, never tried to overturn the outcome of her race. Still, she was asked on Monday night whether she would accept the results of the coming election \u2013 and said yes \u2013 before again accusing Kemp of, through the state\u2019s new restrictive voting law, SB 202, seeking to make it more difficult for people to cast ballots. \u201cBrian Kemp was the secretary of state,\u201d Abrams said, recalling her opponent\u2019s old job. \u201cHe has assiduously denied access to the right to vote.\u201d Kemp countered by pointing to high turnout numbers over the past few elections and, as he\u2019s said before, insisted the law made it \u201ceasy to vote and hard to cheat.\u201d When the candidates were given the chance to question one another, Kemp asked Abrams to name all the sheriffs who had endorsed her campaign. The answer, of course, was that most law enforcement groups in the state are behind the Republican \u2013 a point he returned to throughout the debate. \u201cMr. Kemp, what you are trying to do is continue the lie that you\u2019ve told so many times I think you believe it\u2019s true. I support law enforcement and did so for 11 years (in state government),\u201d Abrams said. \u201cI worked closely with the sheriff\u2019s association.\u201d Four takeaways from Utah's only Senate debate Abrams also accused Kemp of cynically trying to weaponize criminal justice and public safety issues by pitting her against police. The reality, she said, was less cut-and-dry. \u201cLike most Georgians, I lead a complicated life where we need access to help but we also need to know we are safe from racial violence,\u201d she said, before turning to Kemp. \u201cWhile you might not have had that experience, too many people I know, have.\u201d Kemp, though, kept the message simple. \u201cI support safety and justice,\u201d he said, often pointing to his anti-gang initiatives \u2013 especially when he was pressed on the effect of his loosening gun laws on crime.",

            "article_content": "In 2020, when Angela Lang and her team at Black Leaders Organizing for Communities encountered Milwaukee residents who were nervous about voting in person during the pandemic, they pointed to a widely available alternative: ballot drop boxes. Two years later, drop boxes are no longer an option for voters in the state \u2013 after the conservative majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court in July barred their use. So, on Wednesday night, Lang\u2019s team blasted out a text message to voters urging them to return their absentee ballots by mail, no later than November 1. \u201cPeople got used to a new way of voting in 2020,\u201d said Lang, whose group focuses on voter turnout in Milwaukee\u2019s predominantly Black North Side, along with parts of Racine and Kenosha. \u201cBut you can\u2019t have a voting routine\u201d because of the changed ground rules. \u201cIt\u2019s very frustrating,\u201d she said.   A slew of new laws and recent court rulings like the one in Wisconsin have altered the voting landscape ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections. And those changes \u2013 along with a slower fundraising pace by some third-party groups \u2013 could make it harder to replicate the record turnout that led to Democrats seizing the White House and the US Senate majority last cycle. \u201cThere was a lot of work done to help people overcome hurdles in 2020, and rather than celebrate the fact that turnout was really high and being happy about that, new hurdles have been placed in their way,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, who oversees the voting rights program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. Since the 2020 election, at least 20 states have passed laws, imposing voting restrictions that are in place as voters cast ballots this fall, according to a recent Brennan Center analysis that covered legislative activity through September 12. Late-breaking court rulings in places such as Montana and Delaware have further scrambled voting procedures in recent weeks. The political stakes are high: The US Senate majority could hinge on close races in states such as Wisconsin and Georgia, where high turnout helped propel Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to victory in Senate runoffs in the 2020 election cycle and flipped control of the chamber to their party. Warnock, who is on the ballot again this fall as he seeks a full six-year term, faces former NFL star and Republican nominee Herschel Walker. Early, in-person voting began Monday in Georgia. In Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson is trying to fend off a challenge from Democrat Mandela Barnes, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor. The state\u2019s closely watched governor\u2019s race pits the Democratic incumbent, Tony Evers, against Republican businessman Tim Michels. Some Democratic groups say donors are investing less money into mobilizing voters this year than they did in 2020 \u2013 even as voters face bigger obstacles and candidates in high-profile races, such as Warnock, pull in record sums for their campaigns. (Warnock, who has consistently led fundraising among all Senate candidates this cycle, recently reported raising more than $26 million in the three-month period from July to September, his biggest haul yet of the cycle.) Democratic Senate nominees hold cash edge in fall home stretch but face GOP advertising onslaught In Georgia, the Republican-controlled General Assembly made extensive changes to the state\u2019s voting laws in 2021 \u2013 following Democrats\u2019 gains there. In 2020, now-President Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee in nearly 30 years to win the state. The legislative changes range from making it a crime to provide food and water to voters waiting in line to limiting the hours and locations of ballot drop boxes. In addition, voters now have to submit identification when requesting absentee ballots. Previously, election officials were only required to match voters\u2019 signatures on absentee ballots with those on file. The law also made clear that any Georgia voter can challenge the eligibility of an unlimited number of their fellow voters \u2013 which has helped unleash tens of thousands of voter challenges by conservative activists in recent months Aklima Khondoker, the chief legal officer at the New Georgia Project voting rights group, said her organization has had to revise the information it provides to voters and hire more staff to communicate the changes. The group is also urging Georgians to check their voter registration status now to ensure they do not become ensnared by frivolous challenges when they show up at the polls. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to scare people,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to prepare people.\u201d But New Georgia Project officials say the funding for voter information campaigns and mobilization hasn\u2019t kept pace with the demands created by the new law. The group currently has a seven-figure budget gap in its voter education arm, according to chief development officer Candice Drummond. During a recent phone banking operation to contact major 2020 donors who had not yet contributed for the 2022 cycle, New Georgia Project officials repeatedly heard from people who said that they had already given money, said spokesman Paul Glaze. But, he said, many were referring to a leadership PAC associated with Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for Georgia governor, not the New Georgia Project. In battleground Georgia, the Kemp-Warnock voter is the target for both parties in 2022 and beyond (Abrams, a powerhouse fundraiser with a national profile, raised more than $36 million for her campaign and PAC in the three months ending September 30, her campaign recently announced. That\u2019s roughly $7.6 million more than the haul of her Republican rival Gov. Brian Kemp, who narrowly defeated her in 2018.) Black Voters Matter Fund \u2013 another group credited with helping drive the record turnout in Georgia in 2020 \u2013 is likely to run half the number of radio ads in the state as it did two years ago because of budget constraints, said Cliff Albright, the group\u2019s co-founder. He attributes some of the funding issues to the normal drop-off in donor interest in a midterm election, along with the lower profile of the racial justice issues that peaked in 2020 with nationwide protests over George Floyd\u2019s killing. But, Albright said, \u201cpart of this is folks not understanding that doing the same amount of work that we did in 2020, which was herculean in and of itself, requires more funding support.\u201d \u201cIn a perfect world, we\u2019d be able to build on what we did in 2020,\u201d Albright said. But now, he added, \u201cwe have so much more to communicate about what\u2019s changed.\u201d Supporters of the Georgia law, known as SB202 or the Election Integrity Act, point to high participation in this year\u2019s primaries in Georgia to rebut Democratic arguments that lawmakers made it harder to vote. Early voting turnout in the May primaries increased by 168% over 2018, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who backed the new law, said in a news release. \u201cThe incredible turnout we have seen demonstrates once and for all that Georgia\u2019s Election Integrity Act struck a good balance between the guardrails of access and security,\u201d he said. Albright said stronger turnout \u201cjust means we had to work harder to overcome your suppression.\u201d He said his team remains committed to turning out the vote in Georgia and other key battlegrounds, despite setbacks. Activists can \u201cbe frustrated, be mad and maybe even punch the pillow,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have to keep it moving.\u201d It\u2019s not just new laws that have scrambled get-out-the-vote plans. In Montana, for instance, a state court ruling late last month overturned three restrictive voting provisions adopted by the state legislature. Those laws had banned paying anyone for ballot collection, eliminated same-day voter registration and made it harder to use a student ID to cast a ballot. Lawmakers had argued the measures were needed to prevent fraud. In his ruling, Judge Michael Moses, an appointee of former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, said voter fraud was \u201cvanishingly rare\u201d in Montana and found that those laws violated the rights of young and Native American voters. Native Americans fear Supreme Court ruling on Arizona voting law will create barriers Keaton Sunchild \u2013 political director of the nonpartisan Western Native Voice, one of the groups that had challenged the laws \u2013 said the third-party ballot collection will help guarantee that Native Americans, some of whom live on sprawling reservations, can participate. On one reservation, he said, some residents live more than 120 miles away from the closest election office. Sunchild said his organization had to develop alternative plans as the legal challenges have played out \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of a checkerboard, patchwork \u2013 \u2018When we can collect, when we can\u2019t.\u2019 Always trying to figure out: \u2018Is it going to change?\u2019\u201d Sunchild said the group will now proceed with its ballot collection work on all seven reservations in the state, following Moses\u2019 ruling. But the legal fights might not be over. An aide to Montana Secretary of State Christi Jacobsen recently told The New York Times that the Republican plans to appeal the ruling. Jacobsen spokesman Richie Melby did not respond to a CNN inquiry.",

            "article_content": "A selfie crowd formed around Pete Buttigieg as he stood in line for coffee at the airport in Washington. One woman said she wasn\u2019t going to stop because she wasn\u2019t sure it was him. \u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d the Transportation secretary replied. An older man explained to his wife, \u201cThat\u2019s Pete BOOT-GUG,\u201d missing the pronunciation and the emphasis. \u201cHe\u2019s the President\u2019s\u2026\u201d the man said, unable to come up with his job title. And yet, it\u2019s Buttigieg \u2013 whose only political experience before his failed presidential bid was serving as mayor of South Bend, Indiana \u2013 who has become the most requested surrogate on the campaign trail for Democratic candidates in the midterms, people familiar with the requests tell CNN. He\u2019s so in demand that he\u2019s getting more requests than Vice President Kamala Harris, those sources tell CNN \u2013 but still fewer than President Joe Biden \u2013 as Democrats look to defend their narrow congressional majorities and win governor\u2019s races in November. Kamala Harris embarks on midterm campaign swing to boost turnout -- and her own brand With invitations flowing into the White House and the Democratic National Committee, a relatively low-ranking Cabinet secretary\u2019s staff has to choose between Democratic candidates trying to chase him down. There\u2019s no precedent for this. But there\u2019s also no precedent for the winner of the Iowa caucuses becoming Transportation secretary and proving more agile on camera than the vice president and Biden. Both Buttigieg and Harris are widely expected to run to succeed Biden \u2013 whether an open race emerges in 2024 or 2028 \u2013 and for Democrats looking ahead, the party\u2019s preference for Buttigieg on the trail may be an early indicator of the future direction of the party overall. Two dozen operatives and candidates tell CNN they think Buttigieg is benefiting from the desire for a fresh face. Despite a steady uptick since the summer, Biden\u2019s approval ratings are low, and Democrats believe that\u2019s hurting Harris too, who has had her own political struggles \u2013 even as much of the administration\u2019s agenda remains broadly popular. \u201cIt\u2019s the association with being a Democrat \u2013 but not with Biden or Harris,\u201d said one operative involved in multiple House races, explaining why campaigns have been gravitating to Buttigieg. \u201cIn the context of what people have to pick from, he\u2019s very popular.\u201d It\u2019s not just about popularity. Some campaign operatives admit, with a note of embarrassment, they have been reluctant to invite Harris out of fear that would bring scrutiny from Republicans who monitor every word she says in ways Buttigieg rarely has to worry about, leaving candidates as collateral damage in an attack (fairly or unfairly) aimed at the first Black woman vice president. And some point to the basics of tight campaign budgets in the final stretch of the midterms: the vice president\u2019s security footprint is large, and when she travels for politics, some of the costs for the Secret Service and local police protection have to be covered by the campaigns that are bringing her in. Even just a few hours on the ground can run tens of thousands of dollars and create traffic and other hold ups. Buttigieg, by contrast, can travel with just a member of the Protective Services Division squished beside him in coach on a commercial flight. Harris only meets people who\u2019ve been wanded by the Secret Service and tested for Covid-19, while Buttigieg can go to political events making his way through the airport in the reverse of his campaign trail style \u2013 suit jacket on now, but no tie. White House political aides \u201crecognize the dexterity and want to dispatch him to places that he uniquely can go and where Democrats don\u2019t traditionally campaign,\u201d said one person familiar with Buttigieg\u2019s plans taking shape. That\u2019s in contrast to the vice president\u2019s team, which has been hoping to rebuild her standing by keeping her away from many tight races and focused largely on Black voters, among whom she remains very popular, and on women as she talks about abortion rights, arguing that she can have a large influence indirectly. Aides to a West Coast House Democrat in a very competitive race were debating who was going to be their one big ask in the final stretch. The President? The vice president? The first lady? \u201cA senior staffer on our campaign says, \u2018Throwing in two cents from our finance director \u2013 our San Francisco people have expressed that they don\u2019t really care about POTUS, VPOTUS or the first lady. \u2026 They just really like Secretary Pete,\u2019\u201d recounted one of the aides. One Biden adviser highlighted an intentional deployment of the Cabinet over the final month in races where they think they\u2019ll matter most, urging them to appear in their personal capacities to avoid violating the Hatch Act provisions on not mixing government work with campaigning. Only a few secretaries beyond Buttigieg, though, have generated much interest: Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge. Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough, rarely much of a political presence, will also hit the trail soon for a few events. But of those, Buttigieg is the only one who shows up in early presidential polls. He\u2019s the one who was invited to address House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s retreat for top donors in Napa Valley in August. He\u2019s the one who\u2019s already headlined an event for Nevada\u2019s Catherine Cortez Masto, seen as perhaps the most endangered Democrat in the Senate, and for Nan Whaley, the Democratic nominee for Ohio governor. Buttigieg, who came in a close second in the 2020 New Hampshire Democratic primary, was state party officials\u2019 top choice to headline their big fall fundraising dinner, according to party officials, even before a poll that came out in late July showing him leading the field for a theoretical New Hampshire primary, essentially tied with Biden but edging out Harris by 11 percentage points. To the surprise of some in New Hampshire, the White House political office greenlit the invitation not long after. Tickets sold out. The morning of the New Hampshire speech, state Rep. Matt Wilhelm proudly tweeted a photo of a \u201cBOOT EDGE EDGE\u201d mug he had left over from when he\u2019d endorsed and volunteered on his presidential campaign two years ago.   \u201cWhen I was asked by the party, \u2018Who do we want as a surrogate?\u2019 not only was I supportive of Pete, because yeah, I want him back here, but I think that he\u2019s the kind of messenger that we want on the ground to get people fired up ahead of the midterms,\u201d Wilhelm said. He remains very popular in the state, added Rep. Annie Kuster, who\u2019d endorsed him in 2020 and had him headline a fundraiser for her campaign this year. The synth-horn notes of \u201cHigh Hopes,\u201d his old campaign anthem, played as Buttigieg took the stage. He hadn\u2019t done a big political speech in two years. And while rattling off Biden administration accomplishments \u2013 like putting Ketanji Brown Jackson on the Supreme Court and signing bipartisan legislation providing health care for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits \u2013 he had some rusty moments working out new lines. \u201cMost Americans don\u2019t need culture wars every time there\u2019s a gay Muppet or Black mermaid on TV \u2013 we need funding for our public schools,\u201d he said in one riff. But it all built to a very Buttigieg centerpiece, intended to generate knowing smirks more than laughs, and metered out to invite the standing ovation he got. \u201cTeddy Roosevelt had the square deal. FDR had the New Deal. So I\u2019m going to say this body of defining achievements, this incredibly productive year, amounts to such a big deal that we ought to just call it The Big Deal,\u201d Buttigieg said, putting that up against Republicans\u2019 \u201cbig lie\u201d that the 2020 election was stolen from former President Donald Trump. \u201cAnd if, in the tradition of our President, you like to insert an extra adjective in there, feel free.\u201d He ended with a passage that could one day drop right into a political convention speech, soaring past Biden or the infrastructure law or any more Trump mentions, to an aspirational line about building a \u201ctruly representative, fully inclusive, multi-racial, democratic republic like the one that has been under constant construction here on US soil for the last 200 years.\u201d \u201cThis is somebody who really believes in the promise of democracy and in delivering results,\u201d Sen. Maggie Hassan said after the final standing ovation for Buttigieg. \u201cAnd we have seen him delivering results. And his pragmatic approach really means a lot to people here.\u201d Hassan, who is facing a competitive reelection after winning her first term by only 1,017 votes, also had Buttigieg headline a fundraiser for her in Washington earlier this summer. Two weeks later, on another Saturday night, Harris was the featured speaker at the Texas Democrats\u2019 big dinner in Austin. Every statewide Democratic candidate skipped, except the nominee for state railroad commissioner. Tickets were not as hard to get, though the state chair said it was their highest grossing event ever, and some took note that several state legislators from other parts of the state specifically flew in to be there. Harris\u2019 stump speeches tend to be more grounded and direct, much like she is herself. She rooted her Austin speech in home turf stories about former Rep. Barbara Jordan and Lyndon Johnson, leading an enthusiastic call and response. She built up to a line she has often used, paraphrasing, she recalled, \u201cthe words of a great American leader, Coretta Scott King, who said: The struggle for justice is a never-ending process. And freedom is never really won; you earn it, and you win it in each and every generation.\u201d Even though the White House political office lets Harris\u2019 team pick her spots and write her speeches, she can\u2019t stray far. When she talks up Biden\u2019s record, she has to be subsumed to the President. She can\u2019t put her own spin on it, aside from occasional moments, such as two days after Biden rolled out his marijuana policy changes without her in the frame, when she said, \u201cNobody should have to go to jail for smoking weed.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a house that Joe Biden built \u2013 it\u2019s got a bunch of rooms, and as vice president you can choose which of the rooms you sit in. But you\u2019ve got to be in Joe Biden\u2019s house,\u201d a Harris adviser said recently, trying to come up with a metaphor to describe the dynamics within the administration. That reality \u2013 in addition to the different political landscapes in the two states \u2013 helps explains the different responses Buttigieg and Harris received in New Hampshire and Texas. \u201cThe administration does not have a good brand in Texas \u2013 and that\u2019s Joe Biden or Kamala Harris,\u201d said one of the attendees at the Austin event who asked not to be named. By contrast, being part of the administration has benefits for Buttigieg \u2013 without some of the burdens Harris faces. Since he\u2019s doling out federal dollars in his official capacity, politicians like to be seen with him. At the dinner in New Hampshire, nearly every speaker made a joke about how they hoped he\u2019d come back with another big check for an infrastructure project. This past Wednesday in South Carolina, House Majority Whip Rep. Jim Clyburn \u2013 a key Biden supporter, and a promoter of Harris \u2013 spent the day with the secretary, going around with him to multiple events. But he said he had been eager to have Harris appear at the South Carolina Democratic Party dinner in June, and noted that she was in the critical early primary state again at his alma mater just a few weeks ago. \u201cWhen you\u2019re bringing her in, there\u2019s a cost factor that goes far beyond what most Democratic Party folks can afford,\u201d Clyburn said, not the expense of Air Force 2. \u201cWhen we were bringing her to South Carolina, it was a real big problem. In fact, yours truly had to step up to help the party be able to afford it.\u201d That speech, to an enthusiastic room in Columbia, was warmly received. Clyburn called the money he\u2019d kicked in from his own campaign account \u201cmoney well spent.\u201d Buttigieg is both self-aware enough to know that any move suggesting presidential thinking would almost certainly leak and self-confident enough to believe he doesn\u2019t need to start laying the groundwork for a campaign now. People in Buttigieg\u2019s orbit and the secretary himself try to downplay any presidential speculation, and any suggestion of tension between the once and possible future rivals. People in Harris\u2019 orbit say that they don\u2019t spend much time thinking about the Transportation secretary, but when they do, they\u2019re often left feeling he gets a pass on moves that for her would be seen as machinations. \u201cThe future is Joe Biden is going to run for reelection in 2024 \u2013 so what\u2019s the point of thinking beyond that?\u201d said one Buttigieg adviser. In the airport coffee line, though, a woman shrugged as her husband tried to explain who Buttigieg was after mispronouncing his name. \u201cI would not have known him if he bought my coffee,\u201d she said. That\u2019s the downside for Buttigieg. Not far away, a stand was selling Harris bobbleheads and a T-shirt with her face on it. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to more accurately reflect the demand for tickets for Harris\u2019 Austin event, which was the highest grossing event ever for the state party, according to its chair.",

            "article_content": "Betsy Johnson casts herself as the candidate for Oregon governor who will speak for voters who are \u201cfed up\u201d with homeless encampments and trash-strewn streets and tired of watching Republicans and Democrats \u201cfight like two cats in a sack.\u201d   The former Democratic state senator, now running as an independent, likes to boast that she is not campaigning as \u201cMiss Congeniality\u201d and promises to govern from the center. Johnson argues that the policies of Democratic gubernatorial nominee Tina Kotek \u2013 the former state House speaker who appeared at a private fundraising reception with President Joe Biden on Saturday \u2013 would leave the state \u201cwoke and broke,\u201d while stating that her Republican opponent, Christine Drazan, a former state House minority leader, would endanger women\u2019s reproductive rights. \u201cI am the champion and the voice right now of people who feel disrespected, disenfranchised, looked down on, and they\u2019re sick of it,\u201d the bespectacled former helicopter pilot said in a telephone interview earlier this week, before Biden\u2019s arrival in the state. \u201cI have always been pro-choice, pro-cop, pro-change, pro-accountability and pro-alternative to the status quo. The status quo was getting us no place, and the only people that were suffering were Oregonians.\u201d The resonance of that message from a moderate former Democrat with deep financial support in Oregon\u2019s business community has upended the state\u2019s race for governor this year \u2013 unnerving Democrats by creating a scenario under which Republicans could capture the office for the first time in 40 years. More women are running against each other for governor this year than ever before Two years after Portland lived through 100 nights of protests against police brutality and racial injustice \u2013 demonstrations that often led to violence \u2013 the state\u2019s largest city is still attempting to repair its image. That recovery process was hindered by the economic fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic that led to shuttered businesses. And the challenge for Democrats has been compounded by the financial stressors that many voters and business owners are now feeling as a result of inflation. Portland also had a record number of homicides in 2021 and is grappling with a wave of gun violence that has raised concerns about crime. The race between Johnson, Kotek and Drazan to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Kate Brown was already unusual as a matchup between three women in what could be a record year for female gubernatorial hopefuls. But Johnson was also able to pull off a rare feat for an independent candidate by keeping pace in fundraising with the major-party nominees by drawing on her relationships with business leaders. Nike co-founder Phil Knight donated $3.75 million to Johnson\u2019s campaign before appearing to shift his allegiances to Drazan with a $1 million contribution earlier this month. Johnson\u2019s presence in the race has been an unexpected boon for Republicans, who only comprise about a quarter of the electorate. Democrats make up about 34% of the state\u2019s voters and nonaffiliated Oregonians account for nearly 35%, according to the most recent figures from the Oregon secretary of state. Jim Moore, a political science professor at Pacific University, said Johnson appears to be siphoning more votes from Democrats, creating what is essentially a tie between Kotek and Drazan in a state that Biden won by 16 points in 2020. \u201cVoters are growing increasingly unhappy with what the Democrats are doing, but they\u2019re not willing to go to the Republicans who\u2019ve gone further to the right,\u201d said Moore. That has led to support for Johnson among disaffected Democrats and the state\u2019s growing ranks of unaffiliated voters. \u201cThere\u2019s just a frustration that life overall appears to be getting harder,\u201d Moore added. \u201cSo many people have come to Oregon \u2013 or grew up here \u2013 and say, \u2018Yes, I get paid less than other places, but the quality of life is amazing.\u2019 And they\u2019re seeing that quality of life drop.\u201d Drazan, a social conservative and an opponent of abortion rights, has also centered her message around the idea that the state needs greater balance in government as it attempts to address the rise in homelessness, the affordability of housing and achievement gaps students are facing as a result of school closures during the pandemic. Drazan has also criticized the relaxation of certain high school graduation requirements as she argues for a parental bill of rights \u2013 echoing the message from Republicans, such as Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who will campaign with her in Oregon next week. \u201cWe have had single-party control for a decade, which means that we have had the legislature really, truly fail to hold the governor to account, and likewise we\u2019ve had the governor fail to hold the legislature to account,\u201d she said during a recent debate hosted by KOBI-TV and Southern Oregon University. \u201cWe need balance. We need commonsense solutions that are durable \u2013 with long term value.\u201d At a Portland fundraiser for Kotek on Saturday, Biden highlighted Drazan\u2019s opposition to abortion rights and also warned against \u201cMAGA Republicans\u201d and \u201celection deniers\u201d running in races across the country. He invoked former President Donald Trump\u2019s name as he lambasted his influence on state legislatures. \u201cAs long as Trump controls the Republican Party, he\u2019s going to have an incredible impact on state legislative bodies\u201d as well as state government, Biden said. \u201cYou\u2019re a progressive state, you\u2019ve always been ahead of the curve. Stay ahead of the curve and elect Tina.\u201d Kotek has said that Drazan demonstrated obstructionist tendencies when she led a legislative walkout in 2020 to protest a climate bill. The Democrat has argued that Drazan\u2019s move effectively killed legislation that would have advanced the state\u2019s efforts to improve homelessness, among other issues. \u201cTina called for a homelessness state of emergency almost three years ago, but Representative Christine Drazan literally walked off the job \u2013 blocking millions of dollars for emergency homeless shelters and affordable housing construction,\u201d Katie Wertheimer, Kotek\u2019s communications director, said in a statement. \u201cOregonians are justifiably frustrated and want real solutions to homelessness, crime, and the cost of living,\u201d Wertheimer added. \u201cTina will do what Kate Brown couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t, and finally declare that state of emergency, and she will hire crews to clean up the trash. She is the only trusted leader in this race bringing forward real plans that will deliver results.\u201d Drazan defended the rationale for the walkout at the time, saying it was not the time for cap-and-trade policies \u201cbecause we cannot prevent these costs from being passed on \u2013 not to big companies, not utilities \u2013 but just straight down the line to Oregonians.\u201d \u201cHomelessness, crime, affordability, and education all dramatically worsened during her time in power,\u201d Drazan campaign spokesperson John Burke said of Kotek. \u201cOregonians have had enough of her excuses and her failed agenda. That\u2019s why they\u2019re going to elect Christine Drazan as their next governor.\u201d CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In granting pardons for federal marijuana possession convictions, President Joe Biden is taking a historic step that is likely to be widely popular and could energize core Democratic constituencies just over a month from the midterm elections. It would change the lives of thousands of Americans convicted of marijuana possession, especially if governors follow the President\u2019s lead. But it also risks playing into searing Republican attacks branding Democrats as soft on crime, which are rocking multiple key contests ahead of elections that could hand control of the Senate and the House of Representatives to the GOP. The President\u2019s move is limited, for now, and does not go as far as legalizing the drug \u2013 an issue that is central to some campaigns this fall \u2013 including that of Pennsylvania\u2019s Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, whose bid for Senate is Democrats\u2019 best chance of flipping a seat and could decide the destiny of the chamber. Biden pardons all federal offenses of simple marijuana possession in first major steps toward decriminalization Specifically, the President will take executive action to pardon all prior federal offenses of simple marijuana possession. He has also directed the Justice Department to review how the drug is categorized in federal law. It is currently scheduled on the same level as more harmful substances like LSD, heroin and fentanyl and methamphetamine. White House officials said there were 6,500 people convicted of simple possession of weed under federal law between 1992 and 2021. Thousands more faced state convictions. \u201cNo one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana,\u201d Biden said in a video. \u201cIt\u2019s legal in many states, and criminal records for marijuana possession have led to needless barriers to employment, housing, and educational opportunities. And that\u2019s before you address the racial disparities around who suffers the consequences.\u201d Officials in any administration often balk at the suggestion their moves are purely motivated by politics. But Biden\u2019s decision on this issue represents a campaign promise fulfilled, and it\u2019s being rolled out just weeks before a midterm election, so it\u2019s hard not to see this as a highly political move. Biden\u2019s action will, for instance, please civil rights and criminal justice reform advocates since Black Americans \u2013 a key Democratic Party demographic \u2013 are more than three times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. And as with his plan to cancel up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt, Thursday\u2019s decision looks like an attempt to enthuse younger voters, who are increasingly open to recreational marijuana use and who are notoriously hard to drive to the polls, especially in midterm elections. Democratic hopes of fending off a Republican red wave in November have been boosted by increased base enthusiasm following the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion decision \u2013 a trend that Biden\u2019s marijuana pardons could extend. Still, two new CNN polls in Arizona and Nevada \u2013 two crucial Senate battlegrounds \u2013 show that the economy and inflation remain the most important issues to voters and pose a strong threat to Democratic candidates given their monopoly on political power in Washington. One Democrat made an immediate attempt to exploit Biden\u2019s move for his campaign. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who is mounting a long-shot bid to unseat Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, issued a statement pledging, \u201cWhen I am governor, we will finally legalize marijuana in Texas and expunge the records of those arrested for marijuana possession.\u201d In some ways, the debate over the legal status of marijuana parallels the changing social attitudes that drove the fight to legalize same sex marriage, in that the public appeared to be well ahead of political leaders on the issue. Weed is becoming more socially acceptable and popular, a factor that is being recognized below the federal level with multiple state ballot initiatives and laws legalizing it. Just a few months ago, Gallup\u2019s polling found for the first time that more Americans (16%) said they smoke weed than had smoked a tobacco cigarette in the preceding week (11%). And in research that may underscore Biden\u2019s political goals, the National Institutes of Health reported in August that marijuana use among young adults had reached all-time highs. Some 43% of that cohort reported using weed over the past year in 2021 \u2013 up from 34% in 2016 and from 29% in 2011. Last year, Gallup found that 68% of Americans favored legalizing marijuana for recreational use. That figure suggests significant bipartisan support for the President\u2019s historic first foray into the marijuana debate. This is also a takeaway from ballot initiatives and legislative moves to decriminalize or legalize marijuana from Democratic-run Oregon to Republican-dominated South Dakota. A total of 19 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for recreational use for adults over 21, according to the Marijuana Policy Project, an organization dedicated to legalizing cannabis. Yet despite these societal changes, some politicians have still been reticent to move aggressively on the issue. Biden himself has undergone a prolonged evolution but his moves on Thursday still stop short of full decriminalization of the drug. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak reported that there was wrangling inside the White House ahead of Thursday\u2019s announcement complicated by Biden\u2019s personal skepticism about decriminalization. There still appears to be concern among some politicians about being branded as soft on drugs as well as disquiet over the possibility that fully decriminalizing pot could lead to greater drug use among young people. Earlier this year, for example, Delaware\u2019s Democratic Gov. John Carney vetoed a bill that would have legalized recreational use of marijuana, citing uncertainty about long-term health, its impact on young people and law enforcement concerns. The decision by the President could play into midterm election campaigns even at this late stage. Republicans have been rooting their efforts to win the House and Senate partly on ads and rhetorical attacks that portray Democrats as anti-police and soft on crime. They conjure a picture of a nation cowering from violent crime that can all be laid at Biden\u2019s door. Abbott was quick to rebuff the President\u2019s call for governors to emulate his executive orders, and laid out how some Republican candidates might respond. \u201cTexas is not in the habit of taking criminal justice advice from the leader of the defund police party and someone who has overseen a criminal justice system run amuck with cashless bail and a revolving door for violent criminals,\u201d Abbott campaign spokesperson Renae Eze said. (Biden and many of this year\u2019s Democratic nominees in top races have said they do not support defunding the police.) But Americans for Prosperity, the libertarian advocacy group that has often been a force in GOP politics, praised the President\u2019s decision, underscoring how the marijuana issue doesn\u2019t always follow straight party lines. \u201cWe should prioritize criminal justice system resources on protecting life, liberty, and property, not incarcerating people who are not a threat to public safety,\u201d said AFP Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Brent Gardner. \u201cCongress must act to end prohibition,\u201d he continued. The Democratic-controlled House passed a bill that would decriminalize marijuana in April, with a narrow bipartisan majority. But action has stalled in the evenly divided Senate, one reason why Biden is using his executive power to act. Opponents of legalization often argue that as well as having potentially negative health effects, marijuana can be a \u201cgateway\u201d drug that can lead to other substance abuse and potentially criminal behavior. In a major report released last week, the Republican Study Committee \u2013 a leading House GOP caucus \u2013 released policy recommendations for conservatives and highlighted opposition to any moves to make marijuana more accepted. \u201cMarijuana remains a federally scheduled controlled substance, but that has not stopped more and more states and localities from legalizing it under their own laws. This has led to an explosion of marijuana use among children, which is having a hugely negative impact on their health,\u201d the report said. \u201cCongress should not legalize marijuana, while also taking steps to constrain this new industry\u2019s ability to harm children.\u201d While marijuana is regarded by many users as less harmful than alcohol or tobacco, Biden\u2019s own government warns that in the short term, it can cause perception changes and disorientation. In the longer term, according, to the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Department of Justice, the drug can lead to \u201cphysical dependence and withdrawal following discontinuation, as well as psychological addiction or dependence.\u201d Biden\u2019s move was, however, immediately welcomed by criminal justice reformers, given the wide racial disparities in marijuana-related arrests. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s executive order is transformative for the lives of thousands of people and families harmed by our broken cannabis laws,\u201d New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker said in a statement. \u201cThis is a huge step forward toward a more just criminal justice system and more rational drug policy.\u201d And Maya Wiley, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said Biden had righted a historic wrong and warned that the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d had harmed communities of color. \u201cDespite the legalization of marijuana in many states, the federal ban has resulted in too many arrests and prosecutions of Black and Brown people, fueling mass incarceration and the devastation of our communities,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cEveryone in America \u2013 regardless of race or background \u2013 has the right to live safely, provide for their families, and build the future they want. We urge Congress to pass comprehensive drug reform legislation and send it to the president\u2019s desk.\u201d",

            "article_content": "To Letetia Jackson, voting is as important as drinking water or breathing. She has her mother to thank for nourishing that conviction. When Jackson was a mere girl in Alabama in the late 1960s, she\u2019d always accompany her mother to the polls. During these trips, her mother would make clear the sanctity of the franchise. And why wouldn\u2019t she? It was only a few years earlier that President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the Voting Rights Act of 1965, created to prohibit racial discrimination in voting \u2013 to secure a greater degree of equality for Black Americans such as Jackson and her family. \u201cShe would talk with me about how we have a responsibility to exercise our right to vote because people died for us to have that right,\u201d Jackson told CNN. \u201cEven in her 90s, my mother would want me to go get her and take her to the polls. She was determined to cast a ballot.\u201d Jackson, a public policy advocate, reflected on these formative experiences at an uncertain moment for voting rights. On Tuesday, the US Supreme Court heard Merrill v. Milligan, an Alabama redistricting case focusing on Section 2 of the VRA that bars any rule that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of the right\u201d to \u201cvote on account of race.\u201d Jackson is a plaintiff in Merrill, one of the most significant election cases in recent years. Depending on how the court decides, Merrill could allow states more latitude to constrain the political power of Black and brown Americans \u2013 and shrink their access to public resources on the local level. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of surreal. It feels like we\u2019re starting the fight for the right to vote all over again,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if we\u2019ve turned back the hands of time.\u201d Khadidah Stone, a chief field and campaign strategist at Alabama Forward and another plaintiff, echoed some of these sentiments. \u201cThis is a pivotal moment in history, and everyone should be paying attention,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cBut also: Why are we even here? Why do we still have to fight for the right to vote?\u201d Here\u2019s a closer look at how Merrill could affect communities of color: In Merrill, the bench is reviewing a lower court opinion from January that blocked Alabama\u2019s newly drawn congressional map for likely violating Section 2 of the VRA. That map includes just one district where Black voters can put their preferred candidate in office, though Black Americans make up 27% of the state\u2019s voting age population. Because the lower court judges determined that Black voters have \u201cless opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress,\u201d lawmakers were told to form a second majority-Black district or something quite close to it. \u201cThis decision is a win for Alabama\u2019s Black voters, who have been denied equal representation for far too long,\u201d former US Attorney General Eric Holder said in a January statement released by the National Redistricting Foundation. \u201cThe court\u2019s decision reminds us that the moral arc of the universe does indeed bend toward justice \u2013 but only when enough people join together and pull it toward justice.\u201d However, Alabama then asked the Supreme Court to put that ruling on hold. A 5-4 majority granted the state\u2019s request. One argument Alabama makes is that the harm of the VRA is that it essentializes race \u2013 that is, it awards districts to voters based on race and deepens divisions. But that claim gets the VRA completely wrong, per Yurij Rudensky, a senior counsel in the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, which filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs. \u201cThe trial court (a three-judge panel with two Donald Trump nominees) found that, at most, an average of about 15% of White voters in the relevant region of Alabama (the Black Belt region) were willing to support candidates who were also drawing support from Black voters,\u201d Rudensky told CNN. This kind of polarized voting can warp how political leaders approach different groups and leads to unequal political opportunities and can perpetuate other disparities. \u201cThe VRA targets actual discrimination,\u201d Rudensky said. \u201cWhen you have those types of dynamics \u2013 where White voters are splitting 85-15 away from the interests of Black voters \u2013 then there are tremendous incentives for politicians to harness that racial polarization, to make race a more prominent feature of politics, to use race to drive turnout and drive a wedge between communities that may have otherwise shared economic interests or other interests.\u201d It\u2019s not the VRA, in other words, that boosts race\u2019s salience in public life but rather the failure to identify and deal with areas that have persistent racial disparities. \u201cI think that many of the arguments in favor of keeping this congressional map in place and from some of the conservative corners of the court get it exactly backward, in terms of what actually makes race determinative and what\u2019s actually about helping to bridge some of the divides that have plagued communities for decades,\u201d Rudensky said. It\u2019s hard to overstate the stakes in Merrill. \u201cThis is a very momentous time,\u201d Shalela Dowdy, a student at the Southern University Law Center and another plaintiff, told CNN. \u201cThe decision in this case could help shape Black political power across the South.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that Alabama isn\u2019t really arguing that the lower court misunderstood the VRA. Instead, the state is asking that the Supreme Court reimagine the rules governing Section 2 claims. Radically rewriting Section 2, Rudensky said, would \u201cmake it much more difficult, if not impossible, for voters of color, as well as civil rights groups and community groups that work with constituencies facing discrimination in redistricting, to find relief.\u201d In recent years, voting rights advocates have depended more heavily on Section 2 protections, as the VRA continues to suffer death by a thousand cuts. Most infamously, via 2013\u2019s Shelby County v. Holder, the high court gutted Section 5 of the VRA by freeing jurisdictions with histories of racial discrimination in voting from having to gain federal approval, or \u201cpreclearance,\u201d before changing their election laws. \u201cThrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet,\u201d the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in her renowned dissent. The surge in restrictive voting laws following Shelby proved her point. Crucially, in Merrill, it\u2019s not only the abstract concept of fair representation that hangs in the balance. \u201cThe VRA\u2019s underlying logic is that with political equality comes a more natural resolution to systemic inequities in areas such as education, housing, health care and employment,\u201d Rudensky said. \u201cAnd the reality is that it bears out. When you look at places where voters of color had been systemically excluded \u2013 places that had unbroken legacies of discrimination \u2013 and where you saw successful VRA claims, the economic outcomes for Black communities in particular improved significantly.\u201d Put another way, the VRA has created pathways to the middle class and to economic self-sufficiency for racial groups that have long been marginalized in the US. Dowdy expressed similar sentiments. More specifically, she stressed that redistricting has a direct impact on the allocation of both power and public resources. \u201cWhen the members of a community can elect a candidate who shares their concerns and understands their needs, that\u2019s how real change and empowerment can happen. A lot of times when you go through predominantly Black neighborhoods, our neighborhoods don\u2019t look the greatest. It\u2019s because we don\u2019t always have the right people fighting for us to get the right resources,\u201d Dowdy said. She added, \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d In the months ahead, seasoned court watchers will have plenty to parse. They\u2019ll scrutinize oral arguments and attempt to suss out where different justices stand on the issue. On Tuesday, members of the court\u2019s conservative majority appeared to reject Alabama\u2019s more extreme arguments while trying to find a way to preserve the state\u2019s congressional map. Rudensky said that if past years are any guide, we\u2019re likely to see an opinion released toward the end of the term, because Merrill is such an important case and will probably produce sharp divisions on the court. Tish Gotell Faulks, the legal director of the ACLU of Alabama, which has been involved in the redistricting litigation, underlined that what\u2019s at stake is the opportunity for voters of color to have their voices heard. \u201cWe\u2019re still fighting old battles,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be an open question whether or not Black voters have an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.\u201d In some ways, Jackson views this moment as a reminder of how valuable the franchise is. \u201cIt feels a lot like we (Black Americans) have never truly been accepted as full citizens of this country,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this case is a reminder to our young people, who\u2019ve always enjoyed the right to vote, that our votes do matter. Because if our votes didn\u2019t matter, they (lawmakers) wouldn\u2019t be trying so hard to strip this right away.\u201d Or as Dowdy put it, \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder that we should never get too comfortable.\u201d",

Led by Chief Justice John Roberts, justices on the right have rejected policies that consider race, including in redistricting intended to boost the chances of racial minorities to elect their candidates of choice. \u201cIt is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race,\u201d Roberts wrote in a 2006 case.

Tuesday\u2019s case centered on a part of the landmark VRA, known as Section 2, that forbids electoral practices that deny a person the right to vote on account of race, as well as the US congressional map that Alabama drew after the 2020 census. Alabama\u2019s Black population is about 27%, but only one of its seven congressional districts has a Black majority. A three-judge US district court, hearing a challenge brought by Black voters and civil rights advocates, found that the map diluted Black votes in violation of Section 2. The court said it was possible to create a second majority-Black district based on traditional redistricting criteria tied to the size of the population and its geographical compactness. But the Supreme Court blocked the lower-court decision earlier this year, and on Tuesday heard the state\u2019s case. Justice Elena Kagan leapt in first to criticize the Alabama effort to scale back Section 2\u2019s protections, calling the Voting Rights Act \u201cone of the great achievements of American democracy, to achieve equal political opportunities regardless of race, to ensure that African Americans could have as much political power as White Americans could. That\u2019s a pretty big deal.\u201d Takeaways from the Supreme Court's hearing on what the Voting Rights Act means for redistricting Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court\u2019s newest member and its first Black woman, argued against Alabama officials\u2019 emphasis on \u201cracial neutrality\u201d in redistricting, saying the Constitution\u2019s framers adopted the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s equal-protection guarantee \u201cin a race conscious way.\u201d \u201cThey were, in fact, trying to ensure that people who had been discriminated against, the freedmen during the Reconstruction period, were actually brought equal to everyone else in society. \u2026 That\u2019s not a race-neutral or race-blind idea, in terms of the remedy,\u201d she said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court\u2019s first Hispanic justice, stressed that Section 2 was intended to ensure that \u201ca particular racial minority \u2026 can equally participate.\u201d As a group, the high court\u2019s conservatives largely held their fire. Justice Neil Gorsuch asked not a single question. Justice Clarence Thomas posed two relatively modest queries to Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour and no questions to the lawyers challenging the Alabama plan, Deuel Ross and Abha Khanna, or to US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, also asking the justices to affirm the lower court. Thomas, who is Black, has argued that racial remedies violate the Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of equal protection and, in practice, stigmatize the groups they are intended to benefit. He has joined with Roberts in decisions narrowing the reach of the Voting Rights Act, most significantly in 2013 as the court dismantled so-called Section 5, which had required states with a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing election practices. In that opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, Roberts wrote, \u201cOur country has changed, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d Analysis: What is even left of the Voting Rights Act? Roberts\u2019 broader view, as stated in a 2007 case rejecting school integration plans: \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d During Tuesday\u2019s case, Roberts declined to tip his hand on the particulars of the Alabama map, although his record would suggest some sympathy to the state\u2019s position that simply because a majority-minority district could be drawn does not mean that it must be drawn. State officials contend that a second majority-Black district would require racial considerations in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment and Voting Right Act itself. Jackson countered that notion. \u201cI don\u2019t see that Congress is requiring race neutrality,\u201d she said, observing that the law was intended to ensure that no \u201cparticular class of citizens\u201d has \u201cless opportunity\u201d than another. \u201cSo it seems as though Congress is authorizing the consideration of race,\u201d she said. Kagan recalled that in the Shelby County v. Holder decision eviscerating the Section 5 \u201cpreclearance\u201d rule for states with a history of racial bias, the court majority said Section 2 would still be available to remedy any continuing discrimination. But, Kagan noted, a 2021 decision in an Arizona case took a step toward narrowing Section 2 coverage for potentially discriminatory ballot practices. \u201cAnd now here we are,\u201d she said, observing that the Alabama controversy over voter dilution claims in redistricting was setting up the court to take another strike at the Voting Rights Act, \u201cto cut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent to make this, too, extremely difficult to prevail on.\u201d She asked, \u201cSo what\u2019s left?\u201d",

If you read Tuesday that the Supreme Court was hearing a challenge to a key part of the Voting Rights Act and thought to yourself, \u201cDidn\u2019t they already gut the Voting Rights Act?\u201d you were right. They did. A few times already. But the landmark 1965 law looms large in American elections even though conservative justices on the Supreme Court seem to be over it. Recent efforts to update it have failed. Recent Supreme Court decisions have neutered it. The question now is what\u2019s left? The law is broken into five sections and did several important things when it was first passed. Section 1, which is still operable, outlaws barriers to voting like literacy tests, requires the same standards be applied to all voters and bans voter intimidation by state officials. The first gutting of the Voting Rights Act came in 2013, when the court invalidated the system of preclearance, which forced states and jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination and extremely low voter turnout to clear new voting restrictions with either the federal government or a federal court in Washington, DC. But in the case Shelby County v. Holder, Chief Justice John Roberts noted that the formula for determining which states and locations must preclear voting law changes was based on data from 1964, 1968 and 1972. \u201cOur country has changed,\u201d he wrote, arguing that Congress should come up with a new formula. It never did and efforts to update the law with a new Voting Rights Act named for the late Rep. John Lewis are unable to break a GOP filibuster. The second gutting of the Voting Rights Act came in 2021. In the case Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the Supreme Court upheld provisions of an Arizona law that would throw out ballots cast at the wrong precinct and limited who could collect absentee ballots. The decision opened the floodgates to new restrictions in GOP-controlled states and called into question protections in Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act against vote denial, or making it hard for people to vote. Now the court is looking at upending the Section 2 protection against vote dilution, or making votes meaningless, with a case out of Alabama concerning the state\u2019s congressional map. More than a quarter of Alabamians are Black, but the map created only a single majority-Black congressional district out of the state\u2019s seven districts. A federal court ruled the map harmed minority voters, but in a 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court allowed the map to remain in place while it considers the case. Alabama\u2019s Republican secretary of state has argued that considering race to draw maps that give power to Black voters is itself discriminatory. A result favorable to Alabama could let the state draw congressional lines in such a way that no minority voters would ever have a reasonable chance of achieving proportionate influence. Note re: another great CNN newsletter: Fredreka Schouten writes in the Citizen newsletter  this week that the Alabama case is one of two the court is hearing that could change future elections. Read more. Schouten also has a strong report on the scramble to make sure Floridians affected by Hurricane Ian can vote. Read it. After it was passed in 1965, the Voting Rights Act had an immediate effect and updates to the law were passed periodically, under both Democratic and Republican presidents, until 2006. They added protections for non-English speakers, among other things. The Voting Rights Act was passed at a time when fewer than half of eligible Black voters were registered to vote in some Southern states. Black Americans overall are still generally less likely than White Americans to vote in both congressional and presidential elections, according to Census data, but the gap shrank during the Barack Obama era. Younger Black Americans were more likely than younger White Americans to vote in 2008, according to the Census data, and in 2012, Black Americans turned out at a higher rate than White Americans overall. In elections since then, and since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 preclearance decision, a gap has reemerged between White voter turnout and Black voter turnout, according to a Brennan Center for Justice analysis of Census data. It happened in conjunction with a raft of strict voter ID laws passed over last decade that were made possible in part by a 2008 Supreme Court decision. There is research that suggests these laws can reduce turnout in more racially diverse areas and that they also do not affect enough people to alter the outcome of elections. I talked to Zoltan Hajnal, a University of California at San Diego professor who has studied the effect of voter ID laws. He argued voter turnout alone does not tell the story of access to voting. \u201cOne can look at the relatively high turnout and say \u2018hooray,\u2019 or one can look at that turnout and say, well, actually, with a more open, more democratic process, we would have had much higher turnout. And with a more open, more equitable democratic process, we would have had more even turnout,\u201d Hajnal said. The US Commission on Civil Rights, a bipartisan organization, issued a unanimous report in 2018 that found voter restrictions were affecting minority voters. \u201cWe got here from 1965 because of those tools because of the protection, it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand to think that we don\u2019t still need them and the last 10 years or so \u2026 are a clear indication that that\u2019s the case,\u201d Danielle Lang, who leads the voting rights team at the Campaign Legal Center, told me. She said that things like long lines at polling places, absentee ballots that are thrown out on technicalities and other obstacles seem to disproportionally affect minority communities. In the future, Lang predicted these will seem obviously discriminatory. \u201cWith the benefit of hindsight, things like poll taxes and grandfather clauses all look so obvious,\u201d she said. \u201cSome of the forms of voter suppression that we see today don\u2019t seem so obvious to us today. I think they might look really obvious to us in hindsight.\u201d There\u2019s also a strong argument that when people are given more ample opportunity to vote, they do. The 2020 presidential election, during which states extended and expanded voting options due to the Covid-19 pandemic, saw the highest turnout of the 21st century. Multiple states moved since 2020 to limit early voting and voting by mail. Those efforts were led by Republicans, who theoretically stand to gain if fewer people, and fewer minorities, vote. Since 2021, 18 states have passed 34 laws that somehow restrict access to voting, according to an ongoing review by the Brennan Center. Other states have passed laws that make it easier to vote. The restrictive laws will affect voters of color more than the general population, according to the Brennan Center. Some of the restrictions seem pretty clearly aimed at Black voters, such as restrictions on Sunday voting. Barriers to voting like the literacy tests that existed before the Voting Rights Act will not reemerge, Yurij Rudensky from the Brennan Center\u2019s Democracy Program told me. But he said efforts to limit the influence of communities of color will continue in redistricting and through the creation of barriers like making it more difficult to register to vote or underfunding certain polling places. \u201cIt really is a whole ecosystem of laws, regulations and decisions that contribute to how fair and free an election is,\u201d Rudensky said. The current state of the ecosystem is that the federal laws meant to protect minority votes are being challenged and state laws that have the effect of putting up barriers are being passed.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday heard a challenge to a key section of the Voting Rights Act, presenting the conservative majority with another opportunity to whittle down the seminal 1965 law that aims to address racial discrimination in voting. The case concerns the US congressional map Alabama drew after the 2020 census, but the questions the justices are now considering could redefine how the Voting Rights Act can be used to challenge redistricting plans in court. Much of the two hours of oral arguments featured conservatives testing how broadly or narrowly they would need to rule to uphold Alabama\u2019s map, which had been deemed by lower courts as likely discriminatory to Black voters. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court had previously halted lower court orders requiring the map to be redrawn for the 2022 election. The lawyers for the Black voters who challenged Alabama\u2019s map, as well as US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, cautioned the court that even seemingly minor changes to how courts handle VRA cases would drastically complicate the path minority voters have for challenging discriminatory maps in court. That in turn could undermine the political power of voters of color, while shrinking minority representation in Congress and state legislatures. Here are takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments in the case, titled Merrill v. Milligan: After its lawyer had a rocky start Tuesday, Alabama got some signs from the court that it could win the dispute, at least narrowly. And even a purportedly modest ruling in Alabama\u2019s favor would have major impacts on how the Voting Rights Act can be used to challenge redistricting plans. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett had questions for Alabama\u2019s opponents that suggested they were not yet persuaded that the state\u2019s requests in the case should be fully rejected. The Supreme Court is being asked to reassess a test \u2013 known as the Gingles test, named after a 1986 precedent \u2013 that courts use to decide whether a legislative map violates the Voting Rights Act. The first part of that test requires a map\u2019s legal challengers to show a court that enough minority voters live in a place that a majority-minority district could be drawn, and in doing so, that district would be \u201creasonably configured.\u201d Alabama wants the Supreme Court to demand that challengers not use race when they draw the maps that prove that they can overcome that first hurdle of a VRA redistricting challenge. Several conservative justices painted this particular request in the case as narrow, and characterized it as short of rewriting of court precedents around the VRA. But voting rights advocates say that even this more modest retooling of how VRA redistricting cases work would thoroughly diminish the ability of minority voters to bring those cases. One friend-of-the-court brief said that adopting Alabama\u2019s proposal would allow multiple states to wipe out several minority-opportunity districts in their statehouses. Abha Khanna, the lawyer for one set of challengers to Alabama\u2019s maps, highlighted the logistical issues that would arise if challengers were forced to use complicated computer simulations, as Alabama was suggesting, to show they can meet the first prong of the Gingles test in a race neutral way. Still, key swing votes on the court expressed sympathy to the idea. If the court rules in Alabama\u2019s favor, it would mark the third time the Roberts Court punched holes in the landmark civil rights law. Justice Elena Kagan remarked on the pattern in one of the hearing\u2019s more pointed moments. \u201cIn recent years, the statute has fared not well in this court,\u201d she said. Kagan rattled through the two other cases in question, 2013\u2019s Shelby County v. Holder and 2021\u2019s case Brnovich v. DNC. The former case dismantled Section 5 of the VRA, which required certain states and localities to get federal approval for voting policy changes, including the redrawing of maps. In it, the conservatives stressed they were leaving in place Section 2, the part of the law that allows discriminatory voting laws to be challenged in court. But Brnovich whittled away the use of Section 2 in so-called vote denial cases \u2013 or those concerning rules for casting ballots \u2013 as the conservative majority emphasized Section 2\u2019s use for redistricting cases, which are known as vote dilution claims. \u201cNow here we are \u2026 you know, the classic Section 2 dilution claim,\u201d Kagan said to Alabama Solicitor General Edmund LaCour. \u201cAnd you\u2019re asking us, essentially, to cut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent and to make this too extremely difficult to prevail on. So what\u2019s left?\u201d Alabama\u2019s solicitor general had a rough go of it in the early rounds of Tuesday\u2019s arguments, as the court\u2019s liberal wing picked his apart. Justice Samuel Alito eventually threw him a lifeline by turning the focus of the oral arguments to Alabama\u2019s claims about the first prong of the Gingles test. \u201cLet me make sure I understand your \u2013 your basic argument, your least far-reaching argument,\u201d Alito said, as he teed up Alabama\u2019s desire that VRA challengers be required to show, as part of that prong, that a majority-minority district could be drawn without looking at race. Even after Alito told LaCour to pivot to the narrower version of his argument, other conservatives on the court made clear that they had no appetite for the others that would more drastically rework how the Voting Rights Act is understood. \u201cYou\u2019ve been talking a lot about the farther-reaching arguments,\u201d Barrett told LaCour, as she indicated she still need more clarity on the \u201ccentral argument\u201d that Alabama is putting forward. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court\u2019s newest addition and its only Black female member, showed Tuesday that she\u2019ll be a cutting a unique path. This was particularly highlighted by a question she had for LaCour that used originalist arguments to bolster the Voting Rights Act. Key to Alabama\u2019s claims is that lower courts are interpreting the VRA in a way that is putting the law at odds with the Constitution\u2019s prohibitions on racial discrimination. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can assume that just because race is taken into account that that necessarily creates an equal protection problem,\u201d Jackson said, pushing back on LaCour, \u201cbecause I understood that we looked at the history and traditions of the Constitution at what the framers and the founders thought about and when I drilled down to that level of analysis, it became clear to me that the framers themselves adopted the equal protection clause, the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifteenth Amendment, in a race conscious way. \u201d",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court justices wrestled with a key provision of the Voting Rights Act for almost two hours on Tuesday in a case that could make it more difficult for minority voters to challenge alleged gerrymandering and continue the deconstruction of the historic law. Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act bars voting rules that result in a denial or abridgment of the right to vote on account of racial discrimination. The case marks one of the most important disputes the court will hear this term as the justices \u2013 including Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court\u2019s first Black female justice \u2013 consider several cases with implications concerning race. On Tuesday, several conservatives repeatedly questioned the existing framework to evaluate claims of vote dilution in map drawing, while the liberals on the bench expressed support for a lower court opinion that invalidated Alabama\u2019s congressional map, stressing the fact that the state, with a 27% population of Black voters only had one majority Black district. Curtain lifts on another historic Supreme Court term in the new normal A federal court had ordered another majority Black district to be drawn, a ruling Alabama appealed to the Supreme Court. Supporters of voting rights are on edge, cognizant of the fact that in 2013 Chief Justice John Roberts wrote an opinion that effectively invalidated a separate section of the law that required states that had a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing election laws. In the years since, challengers have more heavily relied upon Section 2 of the law, which may now also be in jeopardy. They say that Section 2 has been instrumental in paving the way for minority voters to more fully participate in the political process and that it represents a safeguard against maps that appear to be neutral but actually entrench racial polarization. In court on Tuesday, justices on both sides of the ideological spectrum rejected Alabama\u2019s more sweeping claim that the only way to prove a violation of the law is to show that Alabama intended to discriminate when drawing the maps. That is a much higher bar than whether the maps actually resulted in discrimination. Justice Samuel Alito referred to the state\u2019s broad argument as \u201cfar reaching.\u201d But Alito, along with Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Amy Coney Barrett at times seemed sympathetic to secondary arguments that race cannot be considered too early in the map drawing process \u2013 a sentiment that would likely allow Alabama to prevail and tinker with court precedent. Justice Brett Kavanaugh was harder to read, and Justice Neil Gorsuch remained silent through out arguments. The liberals on the bench strongly supported a lower court opinion that invalidated Alabama\u2019s maps and said court precedent should not be changed. \u201cThis is one of the great achievements of American democracy,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said of the Voting Rights Act, adding that in recent years the law has \u201cnot fared well\u201d at the Supreme Court. Of the lower court opinion Kagan said, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a slam dunk.\u201d And she said that if Alabama were to prevail, it would \u201ccut back substantially on our 40 years of precedent.\u201d \u201cSo what\u2019s left?\u201d Kagan asked. Jackson was a vocal participant, jumping in on several occasions expressing strong support for the existing framework and rejecting the state\u2019s argument that it could not take race into consideration when starting the process to draw lines for fear of violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. Jackson pointed to what she called the \u201chistorical record\u201d to argue that the founders had recognized \u201cunequal treatment\u201d and said that the mere consideration of race does not on its own create an equal protection problem under the Constitution. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can assume that just because race is taken into account, that that necessarily creates and equal protection problem,\u201d Jackson said, and then walked the lawyer through a long colloquy about the founding era, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and the 14th Amendment. Justice Sonia Sotomayor noted the state\u2019s history of discrimination and said that the black community \u2013 through the decades \u2013 has been divided among several districts when other so called \u201ccommunities of interest\u201d had not. Voters and voting rights group challenged the maps in court and won when a panel of judges \u2013 including two Trump nominees \u2013 held that the current map likely violates Section 2 because Black voters have \u201cless opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress.\u201d The court ordered a new map to be drawn with an additional majority Black district, which would have likely led to Democrats gaining another seat in the US House in the fall. In an ominous sign for supporters of voting rights, however, a 5-4 Supreme Court majority blocked that decision, allowing the current map to remain on the books, before agreeing to hear the case this term. Now supporters of voting rights are fearful that the justices are poised to make it much more difficult for plaintiffs to challenge maps under Section 2. \u201cSection 2 remains an irreplaceable tool for ensuring that mapmakers\u2019 discretionary choices do not shut minority voters out of a seat at the table,\u201d David A. O\u2019Neil, a lawyer representing the Brennan Center for Justice, wrote in court briefs in support of the challengers. \u201cSection 2 surgically targets a set of carefully defined circumstances in which mapmakers, as in Alabama, ignored clear and reasonable alternatives that give minority voters the ability to engage in the pull, haul and trade at the heart of the democratic process and instead, design racially polarized districts where minority voters are submerged and effectively shut out of the democratic process,\u201d O\u2019Neil said. As a part of their analysis, the justices reviewed a 1986 case, Thornburg v. Gingles, that established standards for assessing whether a map violates Section 2. The first step is to show that a minority group is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a district that is reasonably configured. Once that threshold is considered, the court moves on to consider other elements. The final step, once preconditions are met, is for the court to look at the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d to determine whether members of a racial group have less opportunity than other members of the electorate. Edmund LaCour Jr., Alabama\u2019s solicitor general, told the court in briefs that for \u201cdecades\u201d the state has only had one majority Black district, and that in 2021, when the state enacted new maps, it \u201clargely followed existing district lines\u201d making \u201crace-neutral adjustments for small shifts in population over the last decade.\u201d But LaCour said the plan was deemed unlawful because the federal court interpreted Section 2 to require the state to \u201ctrade its neutrally drawn districts\u201d in order to draw a second majority Black district. Such a requirement, LaCour argued, puts the state at \u201cloggerheads\u201d with the equal protection clause of the Constitution because the state would have to \u201cprioritize race always in redistricting.\u201d For the challengers to succeed in adding another district, he said, the state would have to \u201cintentionally sort Alabamians by skin color.\u201d The Voting Rights Act, LaCour said, \u201cdoes not require States to create majority-minority districts wherever possible\u201d because \u201ccompelling States to maximize the voting power of one racial group over others obviously raises serious constitutional concerns.\u201d He said that in order to establish irregularities, a plaintiff should be required to prove a challenged practice can be explained only by racial discrimination. Challengers to the current map \u2013 including registered voters and the NAACP \u2013 urged the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court opinion and say that the \u201cmere consideration of race\u201d to remedy a Section 2 violation does not inevitably lead to equal protection concerns under the Constitution. They asked the justices to reject Alabama\u2019s attempt to have the court rewrite Section 2 by placing the burden on the plaintiffs to prove that a challenged plan can be explained \u201conly by racial discrimination.\u201d \u201cAs uncomfortable as the political reality in Alabama might be \u2013 and as strong the temptation to shut our eyes to the tenacity of racial discrimination in voting \u2013 the courts must not blink,\u201d attorney Abha Khanna argued in court papers representing Black voters. Khanna said that plans drawn up by experts for her side show that a second district could be drawn up that complies with traditional redistricting principles that take into consideration compactness, population equality, contiguity, and respect for communities of interest where race was not the predominant factor. \u201cBlack residents in Mobile, Montgomery and the greater Black Belt share deep historical, cultural and political connections,\u201d Khanna wrote. \u201cThey could easily elect their preferred candidates in a compact congressional district drawn consistent with traditional redistricting criteria,\u201d  Khanna said. Instead, she wrote, the state plan \u201cdivides the Black voters within this well-established community of interest across several districts, and as a result, Black Alabamians have no chance to elect their preferred candidates outside of\u201d the one Black majority district. \u201cAdopting a purportedly \u2018race-neutral\u2019 redistricting baseline would serve only to submerge long-oppressed minority groups into districts where they are consistently outvoted by the very majorities that have discriminated against them for centuries,\u201d Khanna said. All Section 2 requires, she said, is that districts be drawn that \u201cgive compact, politically cohesive minority groups a reasonable opportunity to elect their preferred representatives. The challengers are supported by the Biden administration, which noted in briefs that the current framework governing Section 2 vote dilutions has stood for more than 35 years. \u201cDecades of experience have shown that Section 2, as implemented by the Gingles framework, works as Congress designed by screening out meritless claims and providing relief only for the \u2018special wrong\u2019 that occurs when a districting plan combines with racially polarized bloc voting to deny a cohesive minority group an otherwise available opportunity to elect its candidates of choice,\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued. Roberts had voted with the minority to keep the lower court ruling in place while the appeals process plays out. But, critically, he made clear that while the lower court had, he believed, properly followed the Gingles framework, that framework might need revisiting.

            "article_content": "This Sunday, Oct. 2, at 8 p.m. ET and PT, CNN will air Fareed Zakaria\u2019s latest special report, \u201cSupreme Power: Inside the Highest Court in the Land.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts is looking forward to the start of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term on Monday, especially now that the public will be able to attend oral arguments in person and the metal barricades erected to ward off protestors on the plaza have been removed. \u201cI think the more normal the better,\u201d the chief told an audience in Colorado last month. 'We see you, and we are with you': Justice Jackson says she is humbled by reactions since her appointment to Supreme Court Others are wondering what exactly \u201cnormal\u201d means anymore, after last term when the court\u2019s reversal of near 50-year-old precedent changed the landscape of women\u2019s reproductive health, it cut back on the power of federal agencies, it cleared the way for new Second Amendment challenges and it inserted itself into the upcoming midterm elections. Critics say the court is unrecognizable because an aggressive conservative majority is moving the country backwards and, in some instances, erasing long-held rights. \u201cI understand the chief justice\u2019s desire to get back to \u2018normal,\u2019\u201d former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served during the Obama administration, said in an interview with CNN. \u201cBut what the court has done in the last term and what \u2013 I fear \u2013 in the term to come, is anything other than that which is normal.\u201d Pointing to the abortion case \u2013 Dobbs v. Jackson \u2013 Holder said it was an example of the court \u201cnot acting in a normal, appropriate way,\u201d which he said would have entailed following precedent and taking into consideration that people had ordered their lives around Roe v. Wade for a half century. \u201cIt was the court acting in an ideological way to get a result that these justices wanted to get\u201d Holder said. Alito on SCOTUS critics: 'Questioning our integrity crosses an important line' Conservatives, on the other hand, are celebrating the manifestation of former President Donald Trump\u2019s promise to reshape the judiciary. They believe the right side of the bench is correcting errors of the past, lawfully returning the court\u2019s focus to the text and history of the founding era and interpreting the Constitution in accordance with its original public meaning. They look forward to making new headway as part of a new normal where conservatives expand the free exercise clause, work toward a so-called color blind society, and diminish the administrative state. The left \u201chad its way for a very, very long time,\u201d John Malcolm of the conservative Heritage Foundation said on Wednesday \u2013 dating back to the Warren Court era known for its progressive rulings. He says liberals are reacting to the conservative majority now by questioning the legitimacy of the court itself. \u201cIf they don\u2019t get their way, they have to tear the court down,\u201d Malcolm said. It\u2019s unknown whether the public dynamic of recent months \u2013 plummeting approval ratings and nationwide protests \u2013 will impact the decision-making process of the court. All eyes are on three justices in particular: Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Although each is a solid conservative, they\u2019ve emerged as median justices in certain areas of the law. Whether those justices tap the brakes in the coming months will be the story of the new term. Last month, Roberts referred to the court\u2019s current docket as a \u201cnice batch\u201d of cases but went into little detail. A closer look reveals that a common thread runs through some of the most highly anticipated disputes: race. Two cases, for instance, concern the role of race in college admissions programs. Another challenge takes aim at a key section of the Voting Rights Act that was put in place to combat racial discrimination. Breyer warns justices that some opinions could 'bite you in the back' in exclusive interview with CNN's Chris Wallace All eyes will be on Roberts when the voting rights case is argued because back in 2013, he wrote an opinion that essentially invalidated a separate section of the law that required states with a history of discrimination to get any changes to voting rights pre-cleared in advance. As a part of the opinion Roberts wrote, \u201cOur country has changed.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at some of the historic cases coming up: On Tuesday, the court will hear the challenge to Section 2 of the historic Voting Rights Act that bars voting rules that discriminate on the basis of race. The court will review a lower court opinion that invalidated Alabama\u2019s congressional map as a likely violation of the law. The state has seven congressional districts, and despite the fact that Black voters account for 27% of the state\u2019s voting age population, there is only one majority Black district. The lower court ordered another majority Black district to be drawn that would have led to Democrats gaining another seat in the House in the fall. That court said that the map likely violates Section 2 because Black voters have \u201cless opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress.\u201d The Supreme Court can't escape the 2020 presidential race and is already involved in 2024 politics Alabama went to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to put that ruling on hold. The court agreed. Supporters of voting rights are on edge \u2013 cognizant of the fact that since Roberts\u2019 2013 decision challengers have relied more heavily relied upon Section 2, which may now be in jeopardy. When the Supreme Court in February froze the lower court ruling and said that the map in question could be used while the legal proceedings play out, Roberts was in dissent. He said that the lower court had \u201cproperly applied existing law\u201d and there were no errors for immediate correction. But critically, he agreed that the Supreme Court should take up the case due to \u201cconsiderable disagreement and uncertainty\u201d regarding the challengers\u2019 vote dilution claim. Steve Marshall, Alabama\u2019s attorney general, told the court in briefs that for \u201cdecades\u201d the state has only had one minority black district, and that in 2021, when the state enacted new maps, it \u201clargely followed existing district lines\u201d making \u201crace-neutral adjustments for small shifts in population over the last decade.\u201d Marshall argued that the lower court deemed the plan unlawful because it interpreted Section 2 to require the state to \u201ctrade its neutrally drawn districts\u201d in order to draw a second majority black district. Such a requirement, Marshall argued, puts the state at \u201cloggerheads\u201d with the Constitution because the state would have to \u201cprioritize race always in redistricting.\u201d For the challengers to succeed in adding another district, he said, the state would have to \u201cintentionally sort Alabamians by skin color.\u201d Challengers to the current map \u2013 including registered voters, voting rights groups \u2013 urged the Supreme Court to uphold the lower court opinion and say that the \u201cmere consideration of race\u201d to remedy a Section 2 violation does not inevitably lead to equal protection concerns under the Constitution. \u201cAs uncomfortable as the political reality in Alabama might be \u2013 and as strong the temptation to shut our eyes to the tenacity of racial discrimination in voting \u2013 the courts must not blink,\u201d attorney Abha Khanna, representing Black voters argued in court papers. Khanna said that plans drawn up by experts for her side show that a second district could be drawn up that complies with traditional redistricting principles that take into consideration compactness, population equality, contiguity, and respect for communities of interest where race was not the predominant factor. \u201cBlack residents in Mobile, Montgomery and the greater Black Belt share deep historical, cultural and political connections,\u201d Khanna wrote. \u201cThey could easily elect their preferred candidates in a compact congressional district drawn consistent with traditional redistricting criteria,\u201d Khanna said. Instead, the state plan \u201cdivides the Black voters within this well-established community of interest across several districts, and as a result, Black Alabamians have no chance to elect their preferred candidates outside of \u201cthe one black majority district. Race will also be a central theme when the court considers whether institutions of higher education can take race into consideration as a factor when considering admissions. \u201cIgnoring race as one of many factors to be considered in admissions policies perpetuates racial inequalities and the unfair advantages that have always fallen along racial lines \u2013 in and out of education,\u201d Janai Nelson of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund told CNN. \u201cIt also denies all Americans the ability to leverage our greatest strength as a country \u2013 our diversity.\u201d The court will hear separate disputes over admissions programs at the University of North Carolina and Harvard. Students for Fair Admissions \u2013 a group that says it is dedicated to the right of racial equality in college admissions \u2013 is behind both challenges. William Consovoy, a lawyer for the group says that the schools\u2019 policies violate the 14th Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. They want the Supreme Court to overturn a 2003 case called Grutter v. Bollinger. In that case, the court held that schools could consider race as a factor in admissions to pursue student body diversity. \u201cGrutter was wrong the day it was decided\u201d Consovoy argued, because it \u201cdeparts from the Constitution\u2019s original meaning, contradicts other precedents, has eroded over time and has no true defenders.\u201d \u201cBoth universities award mammoth racial preferences to African Americans and Hispanics,\u201d he said and added that Harvard \u201cuses race against Asian Americans.\u201d In the North Carolina case a lower court upheld UNC\u2019s use of race calling it \u201cnarrowly tailored,\u201d while emphasizing that race is considered simply as a \u201cplus\u201d factor. The lower court also said that UNC did not have a viable race-neutral alternative that would allow it to achieve the educational benefits of diversity. Another case with voting rights implications is Moore v. Harper, which has yet to be scheduled for argument. On the surface, the case presents a redistricting dispute out of North Carolina involving a lower court decision that invalidated the state\u2019s congressional map. That court struck the map \u2013 calling it an illegal partisan gerrymander \u2013 and replaced it with a court-drawn map that was more favorable to Democrats. Republican legislators from North Carolina are asking the justices to reverse the lower court and adopt a legal theory called the independent state legislature doctrine. They point to the Elections Clause of the Constitution which provides that rules governing the \u201cmanner of elections\u201d must be prescribed in each state legislature. That provision means, they argue, that state legislatures should be able to set rules in federal elections without being held in check by state constitutions either through interpretation by state courts or by the functioning of commissions created under state constitutional reforms. Traditionally, legislatures have set ground rules for conducting an election, but have not acted alone or had the final word. Processes set in place have been subject to intervention by election administrators and state courts. The majority of the North Carolina state Supreme Court, in ruling against the lawmakers, said that legislators do not have unlimited power to draw electoral maps. The state court acknowledged that redistricting is primarily delegated to the legislature but said it must be performed in \u201cconformity with the State Constitution.\u201d The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court, arguing in court papers that the \u201ctext of the Constitution directly answers the question presented in this case.\u201d The Elections Clause provides \u201cunambiguous language\u201d concerning the manner of federal elections and makes clear that the rules will be drawn by state legislatures. Voters in the state and voting rights groups urged the justices to stay out of the dispute and let the lower court ruling stand. \u201cThe text, history and structure of the federal Constitution reject the notion that state legislatures are unbound by their state constitutions as interpreted by state supreme courts when redistricting under the Elections Clause,\u201d Allison Riggs, co-executive director and chief counsel for Voting Rights at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, wrote in legal briefs. At an earlier stage of the case, three conservative justices, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas, expressed some sympathy for the theory and said the case presented an \u201cexceptionally important and recurring question of constitutional law.\u201d Another case on the court\u2019s docket is a follow-up to a case the court decided back in 2018. That case was brought by a baker who declined to make cakes to celebrate same sex marriages. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the baker, but the ruling was tied specifically to the facts of that particular case and the justices left a decision concerning whether business in general could decline services to same sex couples nationwide for another day. Now a graphic designer in Colorado named Lorie Smith, who runs a company called 303 Creative, seeks to expand her business to create websites designs for weddings. Critically, however, she does not want to work with same-sex couples because she has religious objections to same-sex marriage. She has written a webpage explaining why she won\u2019t create such websites, but under a Colorado public accommodations law, Smith says she cannot post the statement because the state considers it illegal. The justices agreed to consider whether the state law violates he Free Speech clause of the First Amendment. \u201cThis case asks whether governments may use public-accommodation laws to compel artists to speak or stay silent when they enter the marketplace,\u201d Kristen Waggoner of the Alliance Defending Freedom, a group representing Smith, said in court papers. Waggoner argued that artists like painters, photographers, writers, musicians cannot be forced to \u201cspeak messages\u201d that violate their deeply held religious beliefs. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser defends the state\u2019s Anti-Discrimination Act in court papers arguing that it protects Coloradans who buy goods from businesses that are open to the public. \u201cThese customers do not look, love or worship the same way,\u201d Weiser said \u201cbut they all expect to participate in the public marketplace as equals.\u201d He said that the law does not target Smith\u2019s message and does not aim to suppress any message that a company might express. \u201cBusinesses are free to decide what services to offer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Act requires only that the Company sell whatever product or service it offers to all regardless of its customers protected characteristics.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Then-President Donald Trump nearly fired his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner from the White House via tweet, according to a new book from New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman. Trump raised the prospect of firing Ivanka Trump and Kushner, who were both senior White House aides, during meetings with then-chief of staff John Kelly and then-White House counsel Don McGahn, Haberman writes. At one point, he was about to tweet that his daughter and son-in-law were leaving the White House \u2013 but he was stopped by Kelly, who told Trump he had to speak with them directly first. Trump never had such a conversation \u2013 one of numerous instances where he avoided interpersonal conflict \u2013 and Ivanka Trump and Kushner remained at the White House throughout Trump\u2019s presidency. Still, Trump often diminished Kushner, mocking him as effete, Haberman writes. \u201cHe sounds like a child,\u201d Trump said after Kushner spoke publicly in 2017 following his congressional testimony, according to the book. In \u201cConfidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America,\u201d Haberman chronicles the chaos of the Trump White House, with new details about how Trump resisted denouncing White supremacists and made light of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s declining health before her death in 2020 gave him a third justice on the Supreme Court. But Haberman\u2019s book, which was obtained by CNN ahead of its release on Tuesday, goes beyond the trials and tribulations of the Trump administration to document how Trump\u2019s initial rise in the New York real estate and political world of the 1970s and \u201980s permanently shaped his worldview \u2013 and by extension, his presidency. \u201cTo fully reckon with Donald Trump, his presidency and political future, people need to know where he comes from,\u201d writes Haberman, a CNN political analyst. The book is littered with examples dating back decades that document Trump\u2019s obsession with looks, his fixation on racial issues, his gravitation toward strongmen and his willingness to shift his beliefs to fit the moment. Trump tried to recreate the country to mimic New York\u2019s five boroughs, Haberman writes, imagining a presidency that functioned like he was one of the city\u2019s powerful Democratic Party bosses in control of everything. The aides and advisers who spoke to Haberman for the book \u2013 she writes that she interviewed more than 250 people \u2013 offer a damning portrait of a commander in chief who was uninterested in learning the details of the job, who expected complete loyalty from those around him and who was most concerned with dominance, power and himself. Haberman reports campaign aides once called Trump a \u201csophisticated parrot.\u201d Trump lashed out at his top generals during an infamous meeting in the \u201ctank,\u201d the Pentagon\u2019s secure conference room, because he was being told something he didn\u2019t comprehend. \u201cInstead of acknowledging that, he shouted down the teachers,\u201d Haberman writes. Kelly, his former chief of staff, is said to have described Trump as a \u201cfascist\u201d \u2013 uniquely unfit for the job of leading a constitutional democracy, according to Haberman, citing several who spoke to the retired Marine general. Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said of the book: \u201cWhile coastal elites obsess over boring books chock-full of anonymously-sourced mistruths, America is a nation in decline. President Trump is focused on saving America, and there\u2019s nothing the fake news can do about it.\u201d Earlier this year, Haberman\u2019s reporting for her book revealed that Trump\u2019s staff found documents flushed down the toilet, on top of numerous reports that Trump had a habit of ripping up presidential papers in violation of the Presidential Records Act. The former President\u2019s handling of documents has taken on new significance following the FBI\u2019s search of his Florida residence and the revelation he took highly classified documents there upon leaving the White House. Haberman interviewed Trump three times after he left the White House for the book in 2021, including in one instance in which he lied about sending his correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to the National Archives, saying he had taken \u201cnothing of great urgency\u201d from the White House. (The Kim letters were among the items the Archives realized were missing in 2021.) Trump\u2019s cavalier handling of classified material led to distrust between the then-President and the intelligence community, Haberman writes, such as when Trump tweeted out a sensitive picture of damage at an Iranian facility in 2019. He protested after officials tried to make changes to the image. \u201cIf you take out the classification that\u2019s the sexy part,\u201d Trump said, according to Haberman, who wrote that some saw nefarious ends in Trump\u2019s behavior, while others \u201cbelieved he was operating with the emotional development of a 12-year-old, using the intelligence data to get attention for himself.\u201d Haberman depicts all the organizations Trump has run \u2013 his businesses, his campaign and the White House \u2013 as dysfunctional and staffed by people who often disdained one another. His company executives referred to Trump\u2019s company as the \u201cTrump Disorganization,\u201d according to the book, which includes examples of several unusual and eyebrow-raising business practices. That dysfunction spilled into Trump\u2019s campaign and ultimately the White House, where Trump churned through aides and Cabinet secretaries alike, dismissing the advice offered by his own staff. When then-candidate Trump was under pressure in 2016 to denounce White supremacists like David Duke who were supporting his campaign, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was dispatched to urge Trump to be more forceful distancing himself. Trump was heard responding to Christie on the phone that he would get to it \u2013 but it didn\u2019t have to happen too quickly, Haberman writes. \u201cA lot of these people vote,\u201d Trump told Christie, before ending the call. Following the 2017 White supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, when Trump claimed there were good people on \u201cboth sides,\u201d Trump\u2019s then-chief economic adviser Gary Cohn prepared a letter of resignation. Trump appealed for Cohn to stay. \u201cIf you leave, you\u2019re committing treason,\u201d Trump said, according to Haberman. Cohn agreed to stay through the administration\u2019s efforts to pass its signature tax overhaul later that year. As Cohn left the Oval Office, Kelly whispered to him: \u201cIf I were you I\u2019d have shoved that paper up his f**king ass,\u201d Haberman writes. According to the book, several Cabinet officials believed Trump had issues with female leaders. He disliked former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and described her in a meeting as \u201cthat bitch,\u201d Haberman writes. Trump\u2019s former Defense Secretary Mark Esper believed Trump\u2019s push to withdraw US troops from Germany was purely out of personal spite, according to the author. The book shows Trump\u2019s failure to grasp basic policy concepts, such as Trump suggesting in an interview with Haberman that the Senate\u2019s minority party could block legislation by skipping votes. \u201cThe vice president\u2019s vote doesn\u2019t count. It doesn\u2019t count. You might want to check this,\u201d Trump said. When the House introduced articles of impeachment against Trump for the first time in 2019, Trump reacted with a familiar refrain, according to the book: \u201cI\u2019ll just sue Congress. They can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d In the final year of his presidency, Trump tried to wish away the topic of coronavirus, Haberman writes, minimizing it publicly out of an apparent belief that things only existed if they were discussed openly. Before Ginsburg\u2019s death in 2020 created a last-minute Supreme Court vacancy that Trump filled just ahead of the presidential election, Haberman writes that Trump would make light of the justice\u2019s deteriorating health. Trump would clasp his hands and look skyward, Haberman writes. \u201cPlease God. Please watch over her. Every life is precious,\u201d Trump said, before almost winking and looking at his aides. \u201cHow\u2019s she doing?\u201d When another visitor came to the Oval Office, Trump asked, \u201cShe gonna make it? How much longer you think she has?\u201d \u201cConfidence Man\u201d chronicles how Trump\u2019s fixation on race, gender and religion dates back decades, shaped by a tumultuous period in New York City\u2019s history. \u201cRacial is more severe in New York than it is anywhere else that I can think of,\u201d Trump said in a post-presidency interview with Haberman, who writes that Trump \u201coften seemed frozen in time\u201d in 1980s New York and viewed tribal conflict as inevitable. During the AIDS crisis of the 1980s, Trump\u2019s fear of germs and illness led him to announce publicly he would require dates to take an AIDS test, and Haberman writes he called reporters to inquire if people he had met with might be gay \u2013 concerned because they had exchanged a handshake. In the late 1990s, after Trump divorced Marla Maples, he had a relationship with a model, Kara Young, who was the daughter of a Black mother and White father. Haberman writes that after meeting Young\u2019s parents, Trump told her she had gotten her beauty from her mother and intelligence \u201cfrom her dad, the white side.\u201d Trump laughed as he said it, Haberman writes. Young told him it wasn\u2019t something to joke about. Reflecting his view of life as a show he was casting, Trump focused on \u201cthe look\u201d \u2013 telling others that his wife Melania Trump, former Vice President Mike Pence and his first Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch were all out of \u201ccentral casting,\u201d Haberman writes. The former President remained focus on how those who represented him looked. He complained about the way former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, his ambassador to the United Nations, looked on television. \u201cCan\u2019t we do better lighting or give her better makeup?\u201d he asked, according to the book. Trump said his acting Homeland Security chief Elaine Duke looked \u201clike a housewife,\u201d Haberman writes. The director of the Secret Service resembled \u201cDumbo.\u201d The book includes several examples of Trump\u2019s lurid comments, including one episode in 2016 while he was prepping for a town-hall style debate against Hillary Clinton. Then-Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, playing the character of a young leader of a transgender student association, asked Trump his position on whether someone like her could use the girls\u2019 bathroom. \u201cI have a question,\u201d Trump said to a room full of his advisers, Haberman writes. \u201cCocked or decocked?\u201d The group gave Trump blank stares, Haberman writes, and he made a chopping gesture with his hand. \u201cWith cock or without cock?\u201d he asked. Many of the characters who played a part in Trump\u2019s New York life made recurring appearances throughout his political career and his time in the White House, from longtime confidant Roger Stone making preparations in 1988 for Trump to run for president to rivalries with Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York and GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona over a federal loan program spilling into his presidency. Haberman notes how several people who feuded with Trump ultimately worked for his company, including a city housing commissioner who opposed giving Trump a tax break and a Wall Street analyst Trump sued for $250 million after the analyst said Trump\u2019s finances were overextended. It was not unlike how Trump\u2019s 2016 GOP rivals \u2013 from Christie to Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2013 ultimately became some of his most loyal allies in Washington. Trump even adopted his rivals\u2019 insults and tactics. In the 1980s, Trump got into a long-running battle with then-New York City Mayor Ed Koch over a real estate deal. Koch, a Democrat, called Trump a \u201clightweight\u201d \u2013 a dig that Trump himself later adopted, in addition to much of Koch\u2019s style, Haberman writes. After Trump lost the 2020 election, he tried to use some of the same tactics that had kept him afloat in business for so many years. Trump vowed to aides that he simply wouldn\u2019t leave the White House, Haberman reported. Some of Trump\u2019s inner circle, like Kushner, avoided confronting Trump. But Trump wouldn\u2019t listen to those who said he lost anyway. White House aide Hope Hicks told Trump she had seen no proof of widespread fraud. \u201cYou\u2019re wrong,\u201d Trump replied, according to Haberman, hoping to scare others out of agreeing with her. As Trump turned toward January 6, 2021, and the false belief that then-Vice President Mike Pence could block the certification of the 2020 election, Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, warned the Secret Service that Trump was going to turn on the vice president and there could be a security risk as a result, Haberman reports. In the aftermath of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, it briefly appeared as though Republicans were prepared to move on from Trump. But he maintained his grip on the party and has focused much of the last two years on defeating the Republicans who crossed him. Haberman writes that Trump has told others that he needed to get aggressively involved in 2022 primaries to make sure he\u2019d have allies in place if the 2024 election were contested or if he were to be impeached following another White House win. Trump told Haberman that former President Richard Nixon was ousted from office in part because he had \u201ctreated the Senate and he treated the House unbelievable badly, and he got away with it, and then all of the sudden he had Watergate.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is crisscrossing the country this fall to stump for the whole gamut of Republican gubernatorial hopefuls \u2013 from ardent pro-Trumpers like Kari Lake of Arizona and Tudor Dixon of Michigan to establishmentarians like Jim Pillen of Nebraska. And on Tuesday, Youngkin joined the GOP governor Donald Trump hates the most, Georgia\u2019s Brian Kemp. In a GOP often plagued by factionalism, Youngkin is \u201chugging everyone,\u201d said a person close to the governor. \u201cNo one else in the party is doing that.\u201d As a result, the governor who flipped a Biden state last year has become a sought-after surrogate for Republicans. By November, Youngkin will have campaigned for at least 10 gubernatorial candidates, including in many of what the Republican Governors Association considers top target races. Having kept the former President at a distance during his own campaign, Youngkin is now stumping for nominees who have been boosted by Trump and those, like Kemp and Pillen, who have defied Trump-backed primary challengers. Republicans currently control a majority of governorships, with 36 total seats up this year and more than a dozen competitive. In Georgia \u2013 home to a competitive rematch for the state\u2019s top job between Kemp and Democrat Stacey Abrams \u2013 Youngkin rallied with Kemp while wearing his signature red vest, handing his fellow governor a matching zip-up on stage. (Each candidate he appears with gets a personalized Youngkin-like red vest.) How Trump and DeSantis are already splitting the conservative movement \u201cThis is about coming together,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure you make a very large Georgia statement that we are going to make sure Brian Kemp has four more years.\u201d Youngkin\u2019s campaign efforts this year come as the Republican Party seeks a path for the future \u2013 and the Virginia Republican is putting himself out there as a potential champion. The party\u2019s base remains enamored with Trump, who is moving closer to a potential third White House run, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis appears to be waiting in the wings should the former President decline to run or stumble along the way. But where both Trump and DeSantis employ a combative approach to winning the hearts of GOP voters, Youngkin tries to strike an ecumenical tone in order to appeal to all stripes of Republican. That\u2019s how he characterizes his 2-point win last year in Virginia, a state that voted for Joe Biden over Trump by 10 points in 2020. \u201cWe brought people together that had never been in the same room together: forever Trumpers, Never Trumpers, Tea Party, libertarians, independent moderate voters, and a lot of Democrats,\u201d Youngkin told  journalist David Drucker onstage last week in Austin at the Texas Tribune Festival \u2013 another out-of-state appearance that suggests the relatively new governor may already have national ambitions. \u201cOne person I don\u2019t think gets enough credit if Trump doesn\u2019t run is Glenn Youngkin in Virginia,\u201d said Terry Schilling, the president of the American Principles Project, a social conservative group. \u201cHe\u2019s a red governor in a purple state, who won a tough election against [Terry] McAuliffe, and is doing a lot under the radar on these issues that families and conservatives and Americans care so much about.\u201d In a sign he is testing the waters for a future in national GOP politics, Youngkin is holding a donor retreat Thursday and Friday at Keswick Hall, a resort near Charlottesville, Virginia, CNN confirmed. The event, dubbed the \u201cRed Vest Retreat,\u201d will include donors from all over the country, according to a person familiar with it. The Washington Post first reported on the retreat. On the trail this year, Youngkin\u2019s pitch for a winning Republican message is that voters reward the party for responding to \u201ckitchen-table\u201d issues \u2013 not just economic concerns over inflation and taxes but also cultural issues around public schools. Drawing on his winning message last year, he hits the theme consistently as he stumps for Republican candidates \u2013 some of whom are better known for pandering to those who deny Biden won the 2020 election or outright repeat election lies themselves. Dixon won her primary in Michigan after expressing her \u201cconcerns\u201d about the conduct of the 2020 election and earning an endorsement from Trump. And while Youngkin has not waded knee deep into related conspiracies, he did characterize \u201celection integrity\u201d as a top issue when campaigning last year and also called for an audit of voting machines in Virginia, mirroring a broader Republican push to interrogate the 2020 election results. But when Youngkin spoke on Dixon\u2019s behalf last month at the state GOP convention in Lansing, he avoided touching the false claims and instead focused on his familiar themes about the economy and education. \u201cWe are on the side of strong families, low taxes, safe communities,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cWe are on the side of small government, low inflation, American-made products. We are on the side of patriotism, God-given liberties and the limitless opportunities that can lift up all Americans. We are on the side of teaching our children how to think, not what to think. We are on the side of parents \u2013 because guess what? Parents matter.\u201d The refrain has become familiar for Youngkin\u2019s political speeches, and it\u2019s one Republicans say speaks to the concerns of their voters. \u201cHe\u2019s more conservative than you think, being governor of Virginia,\u201d said one GOP operative who requested anonymity to speak freely. \u201cHe can talk really well about parental rights in education, culture creep. Voters want to hear about it. That\u2019s the bread and butter right now.\u201d Virginia\u2019s unique law that bars governors from serving consecutive terms has tended to limit the state\u2019s chief executives\u2019 national ambitions. But Youngkin has turned that disadvantage on its head, embracing a more conservative agenda than might be expected in a Democratic-leaning state to remain in the national conversation. In particular, Youngkin has become a conservative-movement hero in the fights over the teaching of racial and gender identity concepts in Virginia\u2019s public schools. During his campaign for governor, the Republican successfully rode a broad range of frustration on education from some voters \u2013 from Covid-related school closures to curriculum that addressed the legacy of racism in America. And Youngkin\u2019s most recent policy to thrill the right are new draft guidelines from Virginia\u2019s education department requiring parental approval and documentation for schools to recognize a child\u2019s preferred name or pronoun and requiring transgender students to use school facilities that match the sex listed on their birth certificates. The guidelines, which still have to be adopted by individual districts, have prompted backlash from transgender-rights advocates and Virginia students, thousands of whom organized student walkouts this week in protest. Between the national attention to these issues and his appearances in other states, Youngkin has Democrats calling foul. \u201cHe is not focused on his day job that he was elected to last November. He was governor for about three seconds before he decided to travel the country to support other right wing cultural warriors,\u201d said Susan Swecker, chairperson of the Democratic Party of Virginia, who blasted Youngkin as having \u201ca mean spirited edge to everything that he does.\u201d All of this activity has helped Youngkin remain a frequent presence on Fox News, where he is often portrayed as a leader for the Republican Party. In one appearance on the network this week, Youngkin was asked about the GOP\u2019s campaign to win majorities in Congress. The chyron at the bottom of the screen read, \u201cGOP EYES YOUNGKIN\u2019S PLAYBOOK TO TAKE CONGRESS,\u201d as Youngkin hit his talking points. \u201cVoters are really focusing on those issues that they care most about,\u201d he said, listing off inflation, crime and education as top priorities. His ability to command attention has put Youngkin on the radar of those Republicans looking for presidential options outside the Trump-DeSantis dynamic. \u201cRight now, it is Trump vs. DeSantis and, just maybe, Youngkin is the dark horse who could possibly come out of the blue,\u201d said one senior official at a prominent conservative organization in Washington. Kristin Davison, a top political aide to Youngkin, swatted away suggestions this current tour of the country in support of Republican governors and candidates is an early campaign for 2024, arguing Youngkin\u2019s name is \u201cin the mix\u201d because of \u201cthe movement\u201d he started in Virginia and the swift way he\u2019s delivered on campaign promises after becoming governor in January. Youngkin himself has also dismissed questions about his presidential ambitions, including when he was asked last week in Austin. \u201cWhen I see folks step back and ask this humbling question about 2024, it\u2019s just very easy to really, very candidly say, we\u2019re not thinking about 2024,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on 2022.\u201d Gabby Orr contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Over the past two years, Republicans have used their dominant hold on most state legislatures to advance a polarizing agenda moving social policy sharply to the right on issues from abortion and voting to book bans and classroom teaching of race and gender. Now, a new analysis has found that over the next decade, Democrats will face an uphill challenge to dislodge the GOP state house advantage that has allowed conservatives to advance this agenda so broadly and so quickly. In the battle for control of state legislatures, \u201cDemocrats face a defensive outlook over the decade ahead,\u201d the Democratic group Forward Majority concludes in a report released Monday. \u201cGood years for Democrats are ones in which power will come down to razor-thin margins; in contrast, good years for Republicans will be total routs.\u201d The study is based on an exhaustive effort by the group to model how the electoral competition between the two parties will evolve through 2030. At the national level, the study forecasts another grueling decade of trench warfare in presidential elections between two closely matched coalitions, with Democrats positioned to improve across Sunbelt states adding more racial minorities and white-collar workers, and Republicans likely to gain ground across preponderantly White and heavily blue-collar states in the upper Midwest and potentially parts of the Northeast. At the state level, the study says Democrats face a very narrow path toward breaking the GOP\u2019s current dominance. The study concludes that Democrats have a realistic chance of flipping Republican-held legislative chambers in just six states \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona in the near term, and North Carolina, Georgia and, most strikingly, Texas, later in the decade. The battle for legislative power in those states, the report concluded, will pivot on just 85 mostly-suburban and well-educated state legislative districts \u2013 or less than 1% of all the state legislative seats across the nation. \u201cThe opportunity space\u201d for Democratic gains \u201cis limited, but very clear,\u201d says Vicky Hausman, Forward Majority\u2019s co-founder and co-chief executive officer. Forward Majority, a group founded in 2017 to challenge the Republican control of most state legislatures, launched this study in spring 2021. Led by Ethan Roeder, the group\u2019s chief innovation officer and formerly the data director for Barack Obama\u2019s two presidential campaigns, the study analyzed demographic patterns, the trends in electoral behavior among different voter groups (such as Whites with and without four-year college degrees), patterns of in- and out-migration, and other factors to forecast the political lean of the 50 states over the next decade. It ran 90 different computer scenarios that tweaked the expectations for these factors up or down, and then produced its consensus estimate from all of those simulations. Democrats begin this competition for state power in a steep hole. Today Republicans control 61 state legislative chambers and Democrats just 37. (The final state, Nebraska, has a unicameral nonpartisan legislature effectively controlled by Republicans). Republicans hold both legislative chambers in 30 states and Democrats in just 17. (In two other states, Minnesota and Virginia, control of the two legislative chambers is split between the parties.) Adding in governors, Republicans hold unified control in 23 state governments and Democrats just 14. Republicans are using this state-level power to aggressively roll back civil rights and civil liberties and to advance an array of other social conservative priorities. Almost all of the Republican-controlled states are taking steps to ban or restrict abortion; add new hurdles to voting; impose limits on how public school teachers can talk about race, gender and sexual orientation; ban books; increase penalties for public protest; and to eliminate licensing and training requirements for carrying concealed weapons. Taken together, this offensive, supported by the GOP majority on the Supreme Court and Republican senators wielding the filibuster, amounts to a multi-front effort to unravel the rights revolution that began in the 1960s in which the Supreme Court and Congress had steadily nationalized more rights and reduced states\u2019 ability to constrain them. Simultaneously, hundreds of GOP state legislators have launched partisan investigations of the 2020 election results, or otherwise amplified former President Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of widespread fraud. In many ways, Hausman acknowledges, the study underscores how difficult it will be for Democrats to topple the citadel of state legislative power Republicans are using to move this agenda. \u201cOne could read this report and say we are f**ked,\u201d she told me. \u201cThese chambers are hard to win, even at the end of the decade. There is nothing here about them becoming naturally Democratic and ours.\u201d The Forward Majority study sees a realistic chance for Democrats to oust the existing Republican state legislative majorities only in the six states noted above. The group expects Michigan and Pennsylvania, where the lines have been drawn by independent commissions, to remain \u201ca dogfight\u201d throughout the decade, in Roeder\u2019s phrase. It sees immediate opportunity also in Arizona, another state with commission-drawn lines, where Republicans hold narrow majorities in both chambers. Longer-term, it expects openings in North Carolina, Georgia and Texas, states where Republicans have entrenched their majorities with aggressive gerrymandering. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any other states on the map that we see as being big opportunities for Democrats to meaningfully take power from Republicans this decade,\u201d Roeder acknowledges. Across both the near- and long-term battlefield, the group\u2019s modeling shows that the tipping point districts likely to determine control of these state legislative chambers are predominantly suburban seats that are better-educated and more White (although generally still with considerable diversity) than their states overall. The improving Democratic performance in such white-collar areas is why the group believes Democrats can eventually overcome the GOP gerrymanders, but even by the end of the decade, those tipping point seats will still lean slightly Republican in their basic political allegiance. That means, the study concluded, in a hypothetical 2030 election year in which the national popular vote splits exactly evenly between the two parties, Democrats would not be favored to win any of the state legislative chambers across these six states. But, the simulations concluded, the party would be in position to win most of these chambers with a very narrow national popular vote advantage, except in Texas and Georgia, where they would likely need a bigger edge to likely prevail. To increase the party\u2019s odds of winning these battlegrounds, Forward Majority argues that Democrats must increase their organizational investments today in suburban and exurban areas where the party has not typically focused. \u201cThe key for Democrats is to exploit opportunities at the district level that have not been systematically pursued, which can build advantage and shape the electorate of these districts over time,\u201d the report concludes. Most important, the group notes there are \u201c2.2 million unregistered likely Democratic voters in these districts.\u201d But, Hausman says, the party typically has not devoted significant funds to voter registration drives in such areas, focusing instead on urban areas where Democratic support is most concentrated. That can help statewide candidates, she notes, but doesn\u2019t benefit the struggle to win state legislatures since Democrats already control most of the seats in such urban areas. Conversely, while many Democrats have argued for increasing the party\u2019s outreach in rural areas in the hope of boosting their statewide candidates by reducing GOP margins, Hausman and Roeder say such efforts are highly unlikely to sway enough voters to tip many GOP-held rural state legislative seats. The one movable area where Democrats actually can gain seats, Hausman says, \u201cis in \u2026 the suburban districts that lie between the urban districts we already control and the rural districts that are all Republican. \u2026 The entire ballgame is thinking about suburban battlegrounds in a different way.\u201d The study is relatively more optimistic about Democratic prospects in the battle for the White House. Since 2020, an array of Democratic commentators and strategists, such as demographic analyst Ruy Teixeira and data scientist David Shor, have raised alarms that Democrats in the years ahead could be locked out of the White House by increasing educational polarization \u2013 the tendency of more well-educated voters to back Democrats and more voters without college education (including potentially more Latinos) to vote Republican. That could benefit Republicans both because most voters do not hold four-year college degrees and also because those who do tend to be concentrated in relatively fewer states that already lean blue. But Forward Majority\u2019s extensive modeling show the two parties remaining highly competitive for the White House and Democrats even enjoying a slight advantage in conditions that replicate the most common outcomes of the past three decades. The pattern of educational polarization, if it persists, will slightly improve the Republican position through 2030 across the key Midwest battlegrounds (including not only Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, but also Minnesota and some Northeastern states), the simulations project. But, the analysis forecasts, educational polarization, along with growing racial diversity and more in-migration of white-collar workers from other states, will simultaneously improve the Democratic position across four giant Sunbelt battlegrounds: North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Texas. An electorate in which Democrats gain among well-educated voters and Republicans grow stronger among those without college degrees, \u201cis not the fight I would necessarily choose. This is the fight that Republicans have chosen for us,\u201d says Roeder. \u201cBut those are trade-offs we can absorb in a state like Texas or a state like Pennsylvania.\u201d Overall, Forward Majority\u2019s modeling projects that in a completely neutral environment \u2013 an election in which the two parties divide the presidential popular vote exactly in half \u2013 the Electoral College balance between them will remain achingly close. On such a theoretical landscape, the modeling forecasts that Democrats by the end of this decade would be favored to win a comfortable 52% of the vote or more in 17 states (plus Washington, DC) representing 212 Electoral College votes; Republicans in turn would be favored to win at least 52% in 24 states with 204 Electoral College votes. Another nine states would function as the tipping point. Five states with 47 Electoral College votes, notably including Arizona, Georgia and Nevada, would lean very slightly Democratic (between 50 and 52% of the vote); four states with the final 75 Electoral College votes, North Carolina, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Texas, would lean equally Republican. Wisconsin and Florida, two top battleground states in recent years, each move into a slightly more secure position for Republicans, and Iowa and Ohio, competitive as recently as the Obama years, remain decisively red, according to Forward Majority\u2019s modeling. All that means, in the scenario of an absolute tie in the national popular vote, Forward Majority projects Republicans would be favored in states holding a winning 279 Electoral College votes and Democrats in states holding 259. But a national presidential popular vote that is tied or leaning Republican is very much the exception over the past three decades. Republicans have sometimes won the national popular vote, as measured by the total votes cast for each party\u2019s congressional candidates nation-wide, during recent mid-term elections including 1994, 2002, 2010 and 2014. But in the larger turnout presidential contests, it\u2019s been a very different story: Democrats have won the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections \u2013 a record unmatched by any party since the formation of the modern party system in 1828. Of those seven Democratic popular vote winners since 1992, all won by at least 3.9 percentage points except Al Gore in 2000 (.5 points) and Hillary Clinton in 2016 (2 points). (Both of them lost the Electoral College while winning the popular vote.) Under Forward Majority\u2019s simulations, a Democratic nominee at the end of this decade would reach 326 Electoral College votes with even a two percentage point popular vote win \u2013 not only holding Michigan and Pennsylvania but tipping North Carolina and even Texas. In fact, the group\u2019s modeling projects that by 2030 North Carolina and Texas will lean slightly more toward Democrats than Michigan or Pennsylvania do, an outcome that may seem difficult to imagine today, especially in Texas. \u201cPeople can be forgiven for writing off the idea that Texas is ever going to be Democratic because they have probably heard that before,\u201d says Roeder. \u201cBut we have seen Texas creep toward better Democratic performance for a long time. And if just that state alone \u2026 gets into a place where it is legitimately competitive, it has huge consequences for the electoral map.\u201d Turning Texas blue remains very much a long-term project. In the meantime, Hausman has her eye on a more immediate challenge. The Supreme Court earlier this year announced that in its upcoming session it will hear a case about the so-called independent state legislature doctrine. That legal theory contends state legislatures have untrammeled power over the rules for federal elections, unconstrained by governors or even state courts and state constitutions. Democrats fear that if the GOP-appointed Supreme Court majority upholds that argument, it would clear the way for Republican-controlled state legislatures in 2024 to claim fraud, toss out the popular vote results in the presidential election and substitute their own electors pledged to the GOP nominee. That possibility raises the stakes in state legislative contests for this fall. Democrats have a realistic opportunity to win at least one chamber and break the complete Republican control of the state legislatures in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Arizona, all states whose district lines were drawn by an independent commission. If Democrats can flip at least a single chamber in all three states, Hausman notes, it would ensure that there are states representing at least 270 Electoral College votes where Republicans do not fully control the legislature.  Not long ago, Democrats might never have imagined they would need such an insurance policy to ensure a fair outcome of a presidential election, but that may be the new reality they now confront.",

            "article_content": "Maxwell Frost, a 25-year-old community organizer, will win the Democratic nomination in Florida\u2019s 10th Congressional District, CNN projects, and could become the first member of Generation Z elected to Congress. He bested a crowded field of candidates looking to replace Democratic Rep. Val Demings in an Orlando-based district, including state Sen. Randolph Bracy, former US Rep. Corrine Brown \u2013 who recently settled a federal corruption case after winning a new trial and serving more than two years in prison \u2013 and former US Rep. Alan Grayson. Demings is vacating the seat for a Senate run, and she clinched the Democratic nomination Tuesday to face GOP Sen. Marco Rubio in November. Frost\u2019s victory Tuesday makes him the favorite in November for the deep-blue seat that Joe Biden would have carried by 32 points in 2020. \u201cI didn\u2019t run to be the first Gen Z member of Congress, I so happen to be 25 years old,\u201d Frost told CNN\u2019s Laura Coates on \u201cCNN Tonight\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cMy age gives me a different perspective, but we need different perspectives in Congress so that it can really work for everybody.\u201d Ahead of the primary, Frost \u2013 a gun violence prevention activist who this summer disrupted conservative talk show host Dave Rubin\u2019s public interview with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis with calls to end gun violence \u2013 generated considerable buzz. He told Coates that he intends to be a \u201cvocal champion on ending gun violence in Congress,\u201d adding that the country \u201cneeds folks who are going to be bold leaders on it and I intend to join the group of great advocates in Congress to work to build a world that we deserve to live in and that\u2019s one that we\u2019re safe in.\u201d Democrats turn to Charlie Crist to try to slow Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis ahead of 2024 Frost was endorsed by notable progressives such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, as well as the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC, and he had raised $1.5 million through August 3, more than any other candidate in the field, according to Federal Election Commission filings. For the first time, in 2022, members of Generation Z \u2013 those born after 1996 \u2013 are eligible to be elected to the US House of Representatives. (Under the Constitution, House members have to be at least 25 years old, a US citizen for at least seven years and live in the state they represent, though not necessarily the district.) Frost is not the only Gen Z candidate running for Congress this cycle. In New Hampshire, former Trump aide Karoline Leavitt and state Rep. Tim Baxter, who are seeking the GOP nomination in the state\u2019s 1st District, are both Gen Zers. Earlier this summer, two Gen Z candidates lost their primaries: Democrat Ray Reed in Missouri\u2019s 2nd District and Republican Matt Foldi in Maryland\u2019s 6th. For her part, Leavitt  \u2013 who will also turn 25 ahead of the midterms \u2013 told CNN last year that she was running for Congress to bring young voters into the Republican Party. 'My youth is a strength': Members of Gen Z launch campaigns for Congress \u201cWe have people in Washington, DC, that have been clinging to power twice as long as I have been alive,\u201d she said. \u201cMy youth is a strength and that is showing on the campaign trail already.\u201d Leavitt worked as an assistant press secretary in the Trump White House under press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and following the 2020 election, she served as communications director for New York Rep. Elise Stefanik. She faces a crowded GOP field on September 13 in her bid to challenge Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas. Frost on the campaign trail has leaned into his youth and has said that if elected to Congress, he would bring the fervor of Gen Z with him. \u201cOur generation has been through some of the modern challenges our country is going through, yet we don\u2019t have representation in Congress, and we deserve to be at the table,\u201d he told CNN on Tuesday before the election, adding that the possibility of being the first Gen Z member of Congress would be \u201cthe honor of a lifetime.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s something I don\u2019t take lightly,\u201d Frost said about the historic nature of his candidacy. \u201cI\u2019m not here saying I represent the values and thoughts of every single member of Gen Z. We\u2019re like any other generation \u2026 many different ideologies and everything like that. But I think I do holistically represent our lived experience as young people.\u201d In addition to fighting for gun safety, Frost has advocated abortion rights and voting rights with the ACLU of Florida. Since launching his campaign, he has focused his energy on what he calls the need for \u201cbold change.\u201d His platform includes proposals such as \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and a plan for \u201cending gun violence,\u201d as well as the \u201cclimate crisis,\u201d which includes support for the progressive Green New Deal resolution. Frost on Tuesday described growing up as part of the \u201cmass shooting generation\u201d and said, \u201cWe\u2019re a generation that goes through more school shooting drills than fire drills.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen these things and been wondering our whole lives as young people, in high school, middle school and elementary school, why? Why is this happening? Why have we not fixed this? And now we\u2019re at a place where we can vote and we can run, and we\u2019re going to do it,\u201d he said. Frost, who spent the summer of 2020 protesting for racial justice following the death of George Floyd, told CNN last year that he was \u201crunning for what our generation really wants and is asking for.\u201d \u201cWe often talk about what we need to survive. I want to have a conversation about what we need to thrive,\u201d he said at the time. This story has been updated with additional details.

            "article_content": "White House officials have been weighing \u2013 and leaning toward \u2013 the cancellation of up to $10,000 in student loan debt per borrower tied to an income threshold, with an official announcement set for Wednesday, CNN has learned. According to multiple sources familiar with the discussions, the plan is designed to offer the forgiveness to individuals who earn less than $125,000 per year. It is not clear that a final decision on the details of the announcement has been made, and there could always be 11th-hour changes. A source familiar with the plans confirmed to CNN that the announcement will be made on Wednesday. In addition to that baseline of student loan debt forgiveness for individuals who fall under a certain income level, administration officials have also recently discussed the possibility of additional forgiveness for specific subsets of the population, according to sources familiar with internal discussions in the administration. White House officials have also been leaning toward a final short-term extension of the freeze on federal loan repayments that has been in place since 2020. The freeze is scheduled to expire on August 31, and the administration has for months signaled it is preparing for the pandemic-era action to end. Payments have not been required on most federal student loans since March 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic hit the US, greatly affecting the economy. Biden has extended the pause four times, most recently in April, arguing that it was necessary to allow federal student loan borrowers to get back on their feet. A final short-term extension, should Biden select that path, would likely push the restart of payments until after the election. Detailing its expiration in concrete terms, however, would also provide Biden with something to point to that would ostensibly counter at least some of the increased economic demand created by any corresponding debt forgiveness. In recent days, White House officials have been in communication with lawmakers to discuss their thinking on student loan debt forgiveness, ahead of the current pause on payments expiring. And Biden on Tuesday spoke on the phone with three Democratic lawmakers who have been pushing him to cancel as much as $50,000 in debt per borrower \u2013 including Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, sources told CNN \u2013 to discuss the outstanding details in advance of his expected announcement. The President also spoke with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, with the New York Democrat using the conversation to make a final push to cancel as much student loan debt as possible, according to a Democrat familiar with the call. Schumer has pressed for two years for large scale loan forgiveness and has spoken repeatedly with White House officials in an effort to advance the idea in an administration that has been split about its merits, both politically and economically. The White House has suggested in the past that Biden was considering canceling $10,000 per borrower but excluding those who earn more than $125,000 a year. Administration officials in recent days have also discussed the possibility of offering additional forgiveness to certain people. One of the ideas discussed, per sources familiar with deliberations within the administration, has been supplemental debt forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients. However, the fact that the idea has been discussed does not mean that the White House will ultimately decide to go this route, and it is not clear that a final decision on the details of the administration\u2019s forthcoming announcement has been made. Additional debt forgiveness on top of the $10,000 amount could potentially be significant, depending on the maximum size of the supplemental cancellation. Pell Grants are offered to students that demonstrate \u201cexceptional financial need,\u201d according to the Department of Education. Extending extra forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients would mark an attempt to identify a subset of the population who might most benefit from student loan debt cancellation. \u201cThe President will have more to say on this before August 31. As a reminder, no one with a federally held loan has had to pay a single dime in student loans since President Biden took office, and this Administration has already cancelled about $32 billion in debt for more than 1.6 million Americans \u2013 more than any Administration in history,\u201d a White House official said when asked for comment. Setting an income cap, which has been the subject of intense debate both inside and outside the administration, was also crafted as a buffer against criticism that the forgiveness would benefit those with the means to manage their debt payments. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Sunday that Americans can expect a decision from the administration on student loans in the \u201cnext week or so.\u201d With less than two weeks to go, Americans have been left guessing for weeks whether Biden will extend the current moratorium or, perhaps, forgive some of their debt. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking daily about this, and I can tell you the American people will hear within the next week or so from the President and the Department of Education on what we\u2019re going to be doing around that,\u201d Cardona told NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d He did not elaborate on the details, saying he would not get ahead of the announcement. Some Democratic lawmakers and advocates have been urging Biden to broadly cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt per borrower, but the President has consistently pushed back on canceling that much. Biden has canceled more student loan debt than any other president, with his administration authorizing the cancellation of nearly $32 billion in loans largely for borrowers who were defrauded by their for-profit colleges and for permanently disabled borrowers. Marc Goldwein, the senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget \u2013 a nonpartisan group that tracks federal spending \u2013 argued against the plan in an interview with CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow on \u201cNewsroom\u201d Tuesday morning. He believes that canceling $10,000 of debt for each borrower will likely increase inflation, undermine the stated goal of Democrats\u2019 Inflation Reduction Act and will not significantly decrease the racial wealth gap. \u201cThe Inflation Reduction Act saves maybe $300 billion dollars in the first 10 years. If we cancel $10,000 of debt and just extend the pause a few months, we\u2019re going to be at about that much in terms of new cost,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the deficit reduction will be wiped out. At the same time, we\u2019re probably going to do more to increase inflation from debt cancellation than any inflation reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting.

            "article_content": "Tim Miller and Lis Smith built formidable reputations by speaking for important politicians. Now, speaking for themselves, they\u2019ve illuminated the imbalance destabilizing American democracy. Contemporaries, competitors and friends, they\u2019ve each written a memoir exploring some of the events that have left the electorate so disillusioned. Miller, driven from the GOP by Donald Trump\u2019s depredations, catalogues a \u201cRepublican road to hell\u201d he fears \u201cmight just go on forever;\u201d Smith, a Democrat, tells a \u201cpolitical love story\u201d that has tested her idealism but nonetheless left it intact. Stylish and acerbic, Smith has endured plenty of dispiriting experiences as a campaign operative. But they\u2019ve been specific rather than systemic, involving the foibles of individual politicians she has served. She begins and ends \u201cAny Given Tuesday\u201d with her unsuccessful attempts to help then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York when he faced allegations of sexual harassment. Smith says she remained on his team out of loyalty and respect for his gubernatorial accomplishments before finally accepting that \u201che looked in our faces and lied\u201d about his misconduct. Her \u201cfirst crush\u201d in politics foundered similarly. As a Dartmouth College student, she joined the presidential campaign of smooth-talking Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina, whose White House hopes later imploded in the wake of a sex scandal. \u201cIf they seem to be too good to be true, they usually are,\u201d Smith writes. \u201cPublic adulation is intoxicating; it\u2019s easy to get sucked in by the trappings of power.\u201d Miller instead trains a guilty eye on himself and fellow staff members who have propelled so many Republican office-holders in \u201cWhy We Did It.\u201d He faults them for corrupting the party from top to bottom, with damaging effects on the nation as a whole. \u201cAmerica never would have gotten into this mess if not for me and my friends,\u201d Miller writes. \u201cSo many of my friends allowed something that was so central to our identity to become so unambiguously monstrous.\u201d Miller begins and ends with his friend Caroline Wren, a prominent GOP fundraiser. Young colleagues on John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, they would later diverge so profoundly on Trump as to shake his faith in their friendship and much more. His crisis of Republican faith long preceded Trump. He watched McCain, renowned as a straight-talking maverick in an earlier White House bid, lean on the \u201ccomfortable lies\u201d an angry Republican base craved and make Sarah Palin his vice-presidential running mate. Once drawn to a more genteel version of low-tax GOP conservatism, he issues a brutal indictment of the party\u2019s descent since then. What began with the Tea Party rebellion against Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first Black president, turned into the Trump MAGA movement that has made honesty about his 2020 election defeat a disqualification for leadership. \u201cWe advanced arguments none of us believed,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWe made people feel aggrieved about issues we had no intent or ability to solve. \u2026 We spurred racial resentments and bigotry among voters while prickling at anyone who might accuse us of racism.\u201d Miller takes pains to parse the reasons he and his peers remained so long in the service of Trump, who he variously calls \u201cdetestable,\u201d \u201ccomically unfit\u201d and \u201ctruly evil.\u201d In his telling, they range from simple careerism to shared enemies to the belief that in a disfigured party they could help the country more than anyone who might replace them. As a gay man, Miller struggled privately with the party\u2019s resistance to marriage equality (which, coincidentally, is one of the accomplishments Smith hails in Cuomo\u2019s New York record). Yet even after the 2016 election shook him, he accepted a gig assisting a Trump Cabinet pick before breaking decisively with his party in favor of Never Trump combat. Their stories reflect today\u2019s juxtaposition of the two parties. Most Republicans remain aligned with Trump in a single-minded drive to regain power as he disdains democracy\u2019s verdict and the rule of law itself. President Joe Biden and fellow Democrats, meanwhile, fight to leverage their slender, hard-won congressional majorities toward progress against national problems including climate change, high health care costs and tax evasion. The hero of Smith\u2019s tale is Biden Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, an anti-Cuomo of sorts in his honesty and sincerity. Her savvy media advice in his longshot 2020 presidential campaign helped lift him to national prominence. \u201cFor every politician who lets you down \u2026 there\u2019s a new fresh face who can redeem your belief in the process,\u201d she observes. \u201cI still believe in the power of politics to improve people\u2019s lives.\u201d Beyond the likes of Liz Cheney, who last week sacrificed her House seat to defend democracy against Trump, Republican heroism has grown hard to find. Miller closes with his face-to-face attempt to reach common understandings with his one-time confidante Wren, who to his horror had been a \u201cVIP Advisor\u201d to Trump\u2019s January 6, 2021, rally. Despite hours of alcohol-fueled conversation, it didn\u2019t work. Wren too strongly savors Trump\u2019s desire to smite the \u201ccultural elite\u201d and her own role in the political \u201cgame,\u201d according to Miller; should Trump seek the presidency again, she tells Miller, she\u2019ll back his candidacy again even after the violent insurrection. \u201cCaroline has been sucked in by the cult,\u201d he concludes grimly. \u201cLike many of our parents, grandparents and friends, she\u2019s become unreachable.\u201d",

            "article_content": "2022 marks a record high for women running in gubernatorial and Senate races, but the total number of women running for the House of Representatives fell slightly from previous cycles, according to an analysis by the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. While Republican female candidates broke records in all three kinds of contests, the number of Democratic women running for office did not exceed prior years\u2019 totals. Chelsea Hill, data services manager at CAWP, said Tuesday this disparity more likely reflects \u201cpartisan trends,\u201d with fewer Democratic candidates and more Republicans running overall, instead of a cause relating specifically to women. Women of traditionally underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds also broke records in candidate numbers this year, according to CAWP\u2019s analysis. Black women have set record numbers for candidates in gubernatorial, senate and House races in this cycle. There are also a record number of Latina/Hispanic gubernatorial and US House candidates, and a record number of Asian/Pacific Islander women are running for governor. This year CAWP began aggregating data by candidates\u2019 self-identified background groups instead of a singular statistic for \u201cwomen of color,\u201d emphasizing their \u201cdesire to move away from treatment of women as monolithic and challenge the centering of whiteness as a default racial/ethnic category.\u201d As women running for office in the 2022 election cycle have set several records, themes of gender have become more pronounced in the national discourse. With the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision which overturned Roe v. Wade eliminating a federal right to abortion, reproductive rights have drawn renewed attention from both candidates and voters. Kelly Dittmar, director of research for CAWP, told reporters Tuesday that both pro-abortion and anti-abortion female candidates are claiming their personal experiences give them a better understanding of the debate. Beyond reproductive rights issues, other gender themes have also been key in campaign strategy and messaging. Motherhood as a credential has been a common trope in 2022 advertisements, according to Dittmar, with candidates like \u201cMom on a Mission\u201d Heidi Ganahl, the Republican nominee for Colorado governor, and Arkansas Governor GOP nominee Sarah Huckabee Sanders citing their experiences raising their children as an asset. A return to stereotypically male themes has also been apparent in races with male candidates, according to Dittmar who pointed to gun-toting ads by Republicans like Missouri Senate candidate Eric Greitens and Ohio House candidate J.R. Majewski looking to fulfill \u201cmasculine demand.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re seeing gendered and racialized images and messages from both men and women candidates,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cSome of the things we\u2019re watching in this regard are efforts to align with masculine preferences of a Trump base of Republicans.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in the CITIZEN BY CNN newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. In a rare instance of bipartisan accord, a group of 16 Democratic and Republican senators recently reached a deal on legislation that aims to make it harder to overturn a presidential election. It represents the most consequential move in Congress to address former President Donald Trump\u2019s repeated attempts to overturn his 2020 election defeat \u2013 although its passage is far from guaranteed in a Senate that is split 50-50, along party lines. The agreement seeks to overhaul the archaic 1887 law known as the Electoral Count Act that Trump tried to exploit last year by demanding that then-Vice President Mike Pence reject the electoral votes in several states that Trump had lost to Joe Biden. The proposal, spearheaded by Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, would make clear that a vice president\u2019s role in counting those votes is merely ceremonial. And it would make it harder for members of Congress to object to a state\u2019s presidential results by requiring that one-fifth of the House and Senate mount objections \u2013 rather than just one House member and one senator. The bill, backed by nine Republicans and seven Democrats, also identifies state governors, unless otherwise specified in the state law or constitution in effect on Election Day, as the officials responsible for certifying presidential electors. That\u2019s an effort to thwart moves by partisan actors to put forward alternate slates of electors if they don\u2019t like the election results, and it eliminates the opening for Congress to choose among competing slates. (As you\u2019ll recall, Trump\u2019s allies convened false electors in several key states as part of an effort to subvert the Electoral College.) A separate Senate bill, backed by five Republicans and seven Democrats, tries to combat ongoing threats to election administration by increasing federal penalties for anyone who threatens or intimidates election officials or tampers with voting systems. A group of five election law professors recently hailed the proposed Electoral Count Act rewrite as a \u201cmajor improvement\u201d on the antiquated law. But a coalition of leading civil rights groups issued a statement over the weekend, arguing the proposal \u201cis not enough to protect our democracy in this fragile moment.\u201d They want Congress to confront what they call \u201cincreasing racial discrimination in voting,\u201d following court rulings that have eroded the power of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. (Repeated efforts by Senate Democrats to go bigger on voting, however, have failed in the face of Republican opposition and the reluctance of moderate Democrats to change Senate filibuster rules.) Additionally, the Senate version is unlikely to be the final word. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican who serves as vice chairwoman of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol, and California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat on the panel, say the committee will have its own recommendations on shoring up the Electoral Count Act. Next week kicks off a new round of primary elections across the country, and upcoming editions of the CITIZEN newsletter will offer guides by CNN\u2019s campaign team of the key races to watch each week. Perhaps the biggest test of whether election denial has firmly taken root among the Republican faithful will come in Arizona\u2019s August 2 primary. Trump has endorsed several candidates in the Grand Canyon State who have embraced his baseless claims that widespread election fraud led to his 2020 defeat, including Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, secretary of state contender Mark Finchem and venture capitalist Blake Masters, who is vying to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly in the general election. (As CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers recently reported, Masters has even begun to question whether the 2022 election will be legitimate as he works to shore up his bona fides among Trump supporters.) And Karrin Taylor Robson, the Arizona Republican gubernatorial candidate endorsed by Pence, told CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar this week that she does not believe the 2020 election was fair to Trump and would not she say that she accepts the 2020 results. At the local level in Arizona, meanwhile, a four-way race for a seat on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors includes candidates who have advanced election conspiracy theories. One, Republican Thayer Verschoor, a former state senator who served in Trump\u2019s administration, says on his campaign website that the 2020 election \u201cwas corrupt and a win was stolen\u201d from the former President. The Arizona Republic\u2019s Sasha Hupka recently noted that the outcome of this contest in Arizona\u2019s most populous county \u2013 home to Phoenix \u2013 could change the united front that the board in Maricopa has steadfastly presented in defending the integrity of President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. (Election conspiracies about the 2020 election sparked Republicans in the state Senate to order a sprawling probe of Maricopa\u2019s ballots. It became the butt of national jokes last year as the reviewers pursued wild conspiracy theories, such as hunting for signs of bamboo, based on a claim that 40,000 ballots had arrived from Asia. In the end, the recount concluded that Biden had actually won the county by a bigger margin than the official tally.) Biden captured Arizona by nearly 10,500 votes of out of more than 3 million cast statewide. Whoever wins the Maricopa seat will serve until January 2025 and help oversee the 2024 presidential election in the county.",

            "article_content": "We\u2019re in the doldrums of the 2022 election season. Outside of the rescheduled Maryland primary, there are no federal primaries this month. That means political media denizens are looking for almost anything that they can focus on. They got it last week in the form of a New York Times/Siena College poll, which had all sorts of good data in it from a potential 2024 Joe Biden-Donald Trump rematch to the 2022 race for congressional control. But there were two nuggets in the poll that got me thinking the most. One was about voters of color, and the other was on the coronavirus. The first is where we\u2019ll begin our look at the political week that was. All you have to do is turn on the political news to see that we are a country where political tribalism is high. Political science tells us that congressional polarization, for instance, is at its highest level since the 19th century. But while Democrats and Republicans may be further apart on policy than any of us can remember, that breakdown is not occurring along racial and gender lines as much as you might think. Democrats are losing ground with the fastest-growing political bloc: Asian Americans The Times poll showed that Democrats were ahead by around 25 points among voters of color on the generic congressional ballot, which usually asks respondents some form of the following question: \u201cIf the elections for Congress were held today, would you vote for the Democratic or Republican party?\u201d Democrats trailed among White voters on this same question by 10 points. A 35-point racial gap is minuscule by historical standards. I decided to investigate further by averaging polling data from CNN/SSRS, Fox, Marist College, Monmouth University and The New York Times. The average showed Democrats up by 30 points among voters of color and losing White voters by 14 points \u2013 a somewhat larger 44-point racial gap but still historically small. In fact, it\u2019s the smallest divide this century. For perspective, consider recent elections. The racial gap between White voters and voters of color in 2020 races for the US House was about 63 points, according to an average of CNN exit poll and Catalist data. It was about 64 points in the 2018 midterms. Now look at exit poll data going back this century. I couldn\u2019t find a single year with a smaller difference between how White voters and voters of colors filled in their congressional ballots than what the polls are suggesting right now. The lowest was 55 points in 2004 and 2006. The big reason for this shrinking gap is that voters of color are supporting Republicans at very high levels. The previous low watermark for the Democratic edge among voters of color in House elections this century was 40 points in 2004. Republicans are currently doing 10 points better than their best year of 2004. Part of why that is occurring is the changing demographic makeup of voters of color. They\u2019re a lot more Hispanic than they used to be. At the same time, they\u2019re a lot less Black. Hispanic voters don\u2019t support Democrats as much as Black voters. But that\u2019s not all that\u2019s going on. Democratic support from Asian American, Black and Hispanic voters is much lower than it has usually been. (See my previous analyses on these different parts of the electorate.) The electorate is also less divided than it has been in recent years when you break down voting patterns by gender. I pointed out earlier this year that we were seeing a much smaller gender gap than we did four years ago at an equivalent point in the election cycle. When we examine more recent 2022 polling, we see that men are backing generic Republican House candidates by an average of 9 points. Women are supporting generic Democratic House candidates by an average of 7 points. That makes for a 16-point gender gap. In 2018 and 2020, the divide between men and women was about 21 points, according to Catalist and exit poll data. The shift here, while relatively small, is notable for two connected reasons. End of Roe v. Wade may not hurt Republicans in Congress, but it could sting them in the states The first is that it does not seem like the US Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade has divided men and women more than they previously had been in terms of voting patterns. The second is that women, even after the high court\u2019s decision, seem to be supporting Republican candidates more than they have in recent years. You\u2019d have to go back to the 2014 cycle \u2013 a good one for the GOP \u2013 to see women backing Republican candidates at higher levels than they are now. The bottom line here is that although we\u2019re becoming more divided in some ways, we\u2019re less divided along two notable demographic lines. You may have heard that we\u2019re dealing with the most contagious variant of the coronavirus yet. Cases and hospitalizations are rising. Voters do not seem to care, however. Going back to the Times poll, voters were asked what the most important problem facing the country today was. Economic and inflation concerns dominated. Less than 1% picked the coronavirus. The percentage was so low it rounded down to 0%. The Times poll is not the only one to show this. In a Monmouth survey released earlier this month, 1% of Americans said the coronavirus was the biggest concern facing their family at this time. That is an amazingly low percentage given how Americans have generally viewed the virus threat. In Monmouth data, it had been the biggest family concern dating back to March 2020. The previous lowest percentage of Americans who said it was their biggest concern was 17% in July 2021. Americans are less willing to take precautions as the coronavirus wears on This shift among voters could have major political consequences. For one thing, polling last month indicated that there just isn\u2019t the support for the types of mandates (e.g., masks) that places have instituted in the past to halt the spread of the virus. Most Americans opposed a mask mandate in an Axios/Ipsos poll last month. This shouldn\u2019t be too surprising since a record low percentage of Americans have been wearing masks. Another notable consequence is that Biden is probably hurt politically by voters deprioritizing the coronavirus. The pandemic is the only major issue for which his approval rating is higher than his overall disapproval numbers. Unfortunately for Biden, his approval ratings on the issues Americans most care about at this point (the economy and inflation) are far lower. Still, we\u2019ll have to see if any of these numbers change should cases continue to rise. The American public has been responsive to changing coronavirus conditions in the past. This time, though, they may have really moved on, for the most part. You can\u2019t turn on the news these days without seeing how many airplane flights are getting canceled or delayed. It\u2019s one of the reasons I hate to travel by plane. Seriously, who needs the headache? Well, it turns out that most Americans don\u2019t. Going back some 20 years, Gallup has been asking people whether they have flown in the past 12 months. The percentage of Americans who had not taken an air trip was higher than usual last year (62%), which makes sense given the coronavirus. But that percentage had previously never dropped below 52% this century. Confidence in schools: Just 28% of Americans say they have a great deal or quite a lot of confidence in US public schools \u2013 a near all-time low. A mere 14% of Republicans told Gallup they had a great deal or quite a lot of confidence, the lowest since at least 1973. Fair journalism: A new Pew Research Center study showed that 44% of American journalists said members of their profession should strive to give every side equal coverage. Among the US public at large, 76% said journalists should strive to give every side equal coverage. The glass is half full: The aforementioned New York Times poll found that an astounding 77% of voters said the country was heading in the wrong direction. That said, 60% of these same voters were at least somewhat optimistic we could get back on the right track over the next decade.",

            "article_content": "Tuesday\u2019s public hearing investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection examined efforts to gather a mob on the mall prior to the deadly siege of the US Capitol \u2013 efforts that included a massive disinformation campaign that told Donald Trump\u2019s followers that the 2020 presidential election had been stolen from them. Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who helped lead the seventh hearing, snapped into focus the dangers of the January 6 attack by referencing the violence of the 19th century. \u201cIn 1837, a racist mob in Alton, Illinois, broke into the offices of an abolitionist newspaper and killed its editor, Elijah Lovejoy,\u201d Raskin said. He then described Abraham Lincoln\u2019s reaction to the murder. Lincoln was a member of the Illinois state legislature at the time. \u201cIf racist mobs are encouraged by politicians to rampage and terrorize, Lincoln said, they\u2019ll violate the rights of other citizens and quickly destroy the bonds of social trust necessary for democracy to work,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cMobs and demagogues will put us on a path to political tyranny.\u201d The January 6 insurrection: Minute-by-minute Even one-and-half years after the breach, some GOP leaders continue to spread the lie that the 2020 contest was stolen. Consider Michigan Republican gubernatorial hopeful Ryan Kelley, who just days before the seventh hearing mischaracterized the riot, which he was involved in, as a \u201cFirst Amendment activity.\u201d \u201cWe were there protesting the government because we don\u2019t like the results of the 2020 election,\u201d Kelley said during a Republican candidates debate last Wednesday. \u201cThe 2020 election in the state of Michigan was fraudulent, and it was stolen from President Trump.\u201d The testimony of a former Oath Keeper also was illuminating. Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesperson for the Oath Keepers, told the committee on Tuesday that the group is a dangerous militia fueled by violence. \u201cI spent a few years with the Oath Keepers, and I can tell you that they may not like to call themselves a militia, but they are,\u201d he said. Leaders of the Oath Keepers have been charged with seditious conspiracy for their alleged actions on January 6. \u201cI think we saw a glimpse of what the vision of the Oath Keepers is on January 6,\u201d Van Tatenhove said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t necessarily include the rule of law. It includes violence. It includes trying to get their way through lies, through deceit, through intimidation and through the perpetration of violence.\u201d When asked why he broke away from the group, Van Tatenhove said that at one point, Oath Keepers started claiming that the Holocaust never happened. \u201cThat was it for me. I just could not abide,\u201d he said. The ongoing attempt to distort the assault on multiracial democracy \u2013 to smooth the jagged edges so that all that\u2019s left is an alluring tale about patriots \u2013 has reminded some scholars of the leviathan disinformation campaign that began during the Reconstruction era. Southern apologists sought to spin the Confederacy\u2019s war to preserve human bondage as a principled defense of states\u2019 rights. To better understand the echoes between this history and our present day, I spoke with Sarah Churchwell, the Chair of Public Understanding of the Humanities at the School of Advanced Study, University of London. She\u2019s also the author of the new book, \u201cThe Wrath to Come: \u2018Gone with the Wind\u2019 and the Lies America Tells,\u201d a creative and powerful blend of cultural analysis and history. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. In your new book, you look at how the US\u2019 histories of mythmaking can help explain contemporary politics, including some Republican leaders\u2019 responses to the January 6 hearings. In particular, you examine Margaret Mitchell\u2019s 1936 novel, \u201cGone with the Wind.\u201d How can this decades-old story help us understand what\u2019s going on today? \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d offers us a relatively compact and contained history of the Civil War and Reconstruction \u2013 except backwards and wrong. If you unpack it, it gives us a way into the real history and also gives us the story of the mythologies that built up around that history. Most important to me, what it adds to our understanding are the emotions that drove that mythmaking and the collective psychology of US society that made \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d this incredibly popular version of it. So, it gives us the investment in the rewriting of history and an understanding for why that happened, how it happened and what kinds of emotions it reveals about White America and its myths about itself. What I argue in the book is that \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d captures the invention of the myth of White victimhood in the US. It imprints it. I trace the emergence of that story about White victimhood and that reversal that said that the real victims of the Civil War and Reconstruction were not Black Americans but in fact White Americans. I trace that story and the reestablishment of White innocence, because that\u2019s the driving emotion behind the Lost Cause, behind the writing and the rewriting of slavery and Reconstruction and Jim Crow that everything the US does is innocent and righteous, and therefore nobody was wrong in this version of the Civil War, and certainly no White people were. That emotion also is clearly driving some responses to January 6, for example. We\u2019re getting denialism, a refusal to admit that you could be in the wrong and a willingness to rewrite history to make sure that you don\u2019t ever have to confront the possibility that you could be in the wrong. What does \u201cGone with the Wind\u201d tell us about the connection between mythmaking and misdirection? Mythmaking is a kind of misdirection. Mythmaking is misinformation. And it\u2019s disinformation, because it\u2019s deliberately deceitful, which is to point at something else and to say, \u201cNo, that\u2019s the reality.\u201d It serves the double purpose of convincing you of a lie but also distracting your attention from the truth. In terms of how we see some of the same mechanisms play out during the hearings, it\u2019s partly this desire for unity at all costs, without thinking about the victims as individuals or groups. There\u2019s also the fact that this desire for unity at all costs does seem in the US always to be racially inflected. There\u2019s no way to get around that. We keep fracturing over questions of racial justice and equality and White supremacism and then pretending that that\u2019s not what we\u2019re fracturing over. So, the reconciliation is always superficial and fake because we won\u2019t admit what the real problem is, or at least only some of us will say, \u201cWe think that this is the problem.\u201d Scholars increasingly warn about the potential for fresh political violence in the US. What would civil war here look like today? I think that there\u2019s a strong case to be made that civil war in the US looks like what we\u2019re looking at. It\u2019s an undeclared war. We had an insurrection at the Capitol, and we\u2019ve also learned that the (then-)President wanted to lead an armed militia. He wanted to ride at the front of his army to overtake the Capitol. We\u2019ve also got armed militias roaming the streets. We have skirmishes that are White supremacist. When there were skirmishes in Bloody Kansas (in the 1850s), those were the early battles that became the Civil War, the battles that lit the spark. And of course, Fort Sumter said officially that it was war. But we don\u2019t really declare wars anymore. It\u2019s actually very, very rare. We just go to war. And this is being fought in the way that a 21st century war is fought \u2013 with disinformation in a disorganized rather than an organized manner, because we don\u2019t have armies mustering on battlefields. We live in a world where wars are not admitted to be wars. But we\u2019re looking at armed militias. We saw it in what I think of as the summer of Trumpism, in uprisings after George Floyd\u2019s murder. We saw it in Trump\u2019s response. We saw it in the militarized police in the streets of Portland. We saw it in all the militarized police violence against Black Americans, and that\u2019s obviously ongoing. We\u2019re regularly seeing carnage and saying that we\u2019re not in a state of war. Maybe we\u2019re not. Maybe it\u2019s the preamble to war, and it\u2019s Bloody Kansas. But we\u2019re certainly seeing battles, and militarized ones. It\u2019s worth pointing out that at the end of \u201cGone with the Wind,\u201d Scarlett O\u2019Hara is still living in a world of, as you put it, \u201cresistance and delusion, not reunion and forgiveness.\u201d There are those famous closing lines: \u201cTomorrow, I\u2019ll think of some way to get him (Rhett Butler) back. After all, tomorrow is another day.\u201d What lesson does this insistence on fantasy have for our times? Well, there is a fantasy, but there\u2019s also a reality that we can recognize in her ending. It\u2019s the most famously sad ending in a romance that I can think of, except maybe apart from \u201cRomeo Juliet.\u201d It\u2019s an iconically sad ending. And yet, you could also argue that there\u2019s a happy ending there, because Scarlett gets what she wants most, which is Tara (the O\u2019Haras\u2019 cotton plantation). She gets to reclaim Tara. And that\u2019s why \u201cI\u2019ll go home to Tara\u201d is such an important line. That\u2019s the real last line. The loss of Rhett, that symbolic division, is less important to the story and to the protagonist than her retention of power. That\u2019s the happy ending. That\u2019s the saving grace, as far as she\u2019s concerned. What is the lesson? It tells us that the emotional resonance of this story is that retaining power through property is more important than trying to reunify over division, that we\u2019ll take the division if we can reclaim the power and the property.",

            "article_content": "Hours after the assassination of former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday, top US and British security officials decried threats facing public figures around the globe in an exclusive interview with CNN, saying that there is a \u201cright way\u201d to protest political grievances. \u201cThere are way, way too many people in today\u2019s world who are taking their very passionately held views and manifesting them through violence,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray told CNN. \u201cAnd our system, as you know, under the First Amendment, doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re upset about, who you\u2019re upset with, or what side of an issue you\u2019re on. There\u2019s a right way under our Bill of Rights to express yourself, and violence, threats of violence, destruction of property \u2013 those kinds of things are not it.\u201d FBI Director Wray, MI5 chief raise alarm over China spying The FBI director traveled to London this week to meet with Ken McCallum, director general of MI5, to highlight the two agencies\u2019 close coordination on everything from counterterrorism to cyber attacks, and Russian and Chinese espionage. The two leaders sat for a wide-ranging interview in which they discussed Abe\u2019s assassination and the rising threat of extremist violence. \u201cWe have to guard against the potential risks of terrorist groups targeting prominent individuals, and we also have to defend against non-ideological threats where people are fixated or there are other forms of mental health issues,\u201d McCallum said in a rare interview, adding that it is the job of security officials to \u201cget after them all to the maximum extent that we can, and that is not easy, especially in cases where there are very few dots to join.\u201d Wray\u2019s comments come after Abe\u2019s assassination and the thwarted plot to kill Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh last month. He also expressed concerns about the exponential rise in home-grown extremism in the US and emphasized the need for local law enforcement to patrol their own communities for potential lone actors who have access to guns. The Highland Park, Illinois, July 4 parade shooting suspect obtained guns after passing federal background checks. The FBI director also addressed the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, saying it reflects a \u201cbroader phenomenon\u201d of people becoming violent over ideological, social or political grievances. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re upset about an election, upset about a trial upset about the criminal justice system, upset about any issue, there\u2019s a right way to express yourself under the First Amendment, and violence or destruction of federal property or in the case of January 6, those things, plus interference with a sacred part of our constitutional process, Then we\u2019re going to have to act,\u201d Wray said. \u201cThat\u2019s the rule of law. That\u2019s what the rule of law is all about.\u201d When asked about where that could lead in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigation, Wray said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to follow the facts wherever they lead, no matter who likes it.\u201d Supreme Court marshal asked Maryland and Virginia governors to protect justices. Here's what they said. Wray compared the current rising threat from domestic extremists, motivated by racial or anti-government views, to earlier threats from people radicalized by foreign terrorist groups. \u201cThe most lethal terrorist attacks in the homeland over the last several years have largely been from domestic terrorists and that covers a wide range of threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to tackle the threat through similar vehicles that we\u2019ve attacked, homegrown jihadist-inspired extremism, our joint terrorism task forces that are all over in the United States, working with state local charges when those are available and trying to make sure that we\u2019re reaching out to the community for tips and leads,\u201d Wray said. \u201cBecause in this space \u2013 the domestic violent extremism space \u2013 much like the jihadist-inspired extremism, you\u2019re talking about largely lone actors who are coming up with attack plans that are fairly crude and simple, but don\u2019t leave a lot of footprints or dots to connect.\u201d The FBI has dedicated resources from offices around the country to the largest investigation in Justice Department history, helping to bring charges against more than 800 people involved in the US Capitol riot. And CNN has reported that the probe has recently expanded to include people who didn\u2019t show up at the Capitol to riot but help propel the violence by pushing lies about vote fraud and seeking to overturn the election.

            "article_content": "Rarely have Americans been so divided on what their country stands for as on the 246th anniversary of independence. As red, white and blue fireworks burst in air on Monday night, politics may not be at the forefront of most people\u2019s minds. Yet a fractious partisan age is undeniably penetrating everyone\u2019s lives. If, as Abraham Lincoln said, a house divided against itself cannot stand, the years to come beckon even more national discombobulation. The unity for which President Joe Biden pleaded in his inaugural address seems more elusive than ever. US democracy is still fighting for its survival, as the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol reveals ever more frightening details of Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to steal the 2020 election. The ex-President is, meanwhile, impatient to launch a 2024 campaign rooted in his election fraud lies that would highlight his increasingly autocratic tendencies. Supreme Court makes it clear there's a red America and a blue America In another example of startling political disruption, an activist Supreme Court, protected behind high metal fences in its marbled Washington chambers, just stripped away the constitutional right of millions of women to have an abortion. The decision validates a half-century campaign by conservative activists, many of whom have sincere moral objections against abortion, which they equate with the murder of an unborn child. But the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and the emerging patchwork system of abortion restrictions across the US have been met with outrage in other parts of America. On Sunday, South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem, a potential Republican presidential candidate, defended her state\u2019s abortion ban on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d when asked whether a 10-year-old girl who was raped should be forced to give birth, or to explain how her state will care for women deprived of the right to end a pregnancy. Her evasions encapsulated how many supporters of abortion rights see hypocrisy and inhumanity among some of those who profess to care for life \u2013 and the irreconcilable divide on this issue in the country. Given the political discord boiling way beneath the surface of Monday\u2019s national celebrations, it\u2019s hardly surprising that a staggering 85% of US adults in an Associated Press-NORC poll released last week said things in the country are headed in the wrong direction. The survey formalized what is obvious: for all its advantages, abundant resources, comparative prosperity and history of working to perfect its democracy, the United States is not a country at ease with itself right now. The clich\u00e9 that America\u2019s best days are ahead is becoming harder to believe. Social tensions are being exacerbated by economic pressure. The war in Ukraine is making food bills more expensive and spiked gasoline to record prices. Biden\u2019s struggling presidency appears out of ideas as to how to help after potentially worsening the situation by pumping hundreds of millions of dollars of spending into the economy. Gun crime in cities is recalling a more violent past and every Monday brings a grim accounting of the weekend\u2019s mass shootings. In the latest tragic outburst of violence, at least six people were killed and two dozen were injured at a shooting at a Fourth of July parade in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park on Monday. The exact circumstances of the incident were not immediately clear Monday afternoon as authorities launched a search for the perpetrator. The sense of a country politically on edge is being exacerbated by the shadow of Trump\u2019s violent coup attempt. The Supreme Court's conservative majority is a threat to the world A flurry of restrictions on voting in many conservative-led states and the GOP\u2019s refusal to renew voting rights legislation harken back to a poisoned era of racial repression. Liberals who once dreamed of a new Franklin Roosevelt are dissatisfied with the results of their narrow monopoly on political power in Biden\u2019s Washington. But their radicalism also risks alienating the crucial middle ground of voters who ought to be up for grabs as the GOP dives right. Incredibly, the country is struggling to make enough infant formula to feed its babies \u2013 and is having to fly in emergency supplies from abroad \u2013 a metaphor if there ever was one for a time when things just don\u2019t seem to be going very well. And in some regions, the spectacles that bring Americans of all persuasions side by side \u2013 the July Fourth fireworks shows \u2013 are being dampened by bans imposed because the land is tinderbox dry because of global warming, another threat that defies a political consensus for action. Almost every day, there\u2019s a controversy or political fight that underscores the antagonism between more moderate, diverse and socially tolerant American cities and suburbs and the conservatism of rural America. Many leaders on both sides of the aisle accentuate differences for political gain, only adding to the sense of anger coursing through the country. Elected leaders who seek to bring those with divergent views together are an endangered species. Increasingly, for those who think about politics, each side of the divide sees the other as an existentialist threat to their idea of America \u2013 a schism of perception especially demonstrated in recent weeks by the fight between supporters and opponents of abortion rights. Trump weighs early 2024 launch as January 6 committee looms over his future On the right, disillusionment with government itself \u2013 which fueled Trump\u2019s rise and is being exacerbated by his election fraud lies \u2013 is a driving force in a Republican Party that is giving up on democracy. On the left, more and more people see a Supreme Court that is openly flouting majority opinion as illegitimate. The high court was once seen as above the partisan flames. But even its justices have been caught up in a tide of fury, with sniping more characteristic of social media than Supreme Court opinions. During oral arguments before last month\u2019s landmark overturning of Roe v. Wade, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor wondered whether the court could \u201csurvive the stench\u201d of stripping away abortion rights. In his majority opinion that did just that, Justice Samuel Alito relished dismissing the reasoning behind Roe as \u201cegregiously wrong.\u201d The Supreme Court was once seen as a moderating force for stability. But in its new zeal for ripping up precedents, the conservative majority has turned it into yet another destabilizing force in society. So what grounds are there for hope this Independence Day? Biden is insisting that things are not as bad as they seem, seeking to fulfill that part of a president\u2019s duties that involve bucking the country up. \u201cYou haven\u2019t found one person, one world leader to say America is going backwards,\u201d the President insisted as he wrapped up a visit to Europe last week. \u201cAmerica is better positioned to lead the world than we ever have been. We have the strongest economy in the world. Our inflation rates are lower than other nations in the world,\u201d he said, while being somewhat economical with the truth when it comes to the spike in inflation that he once dismissed. Biden, of course, has an interest in painting things in a better light than they are, especially with midterm elections approaching in which Democrats are likely to suffer from his sub-40% approval rating. But it\u2019s not all darkness. Biden has piloted the United States out of the depths of the pandemic recession. Prices might be high and consuming wage gains, but unemployment is around 50-year lows. This could cushion the impact of a recession many experts fear is on the way. Hindsight showed that Biden\u2019s declaration of partial independence from Covid-19 last July Fourth was premature \u2013 and politically unwise. But life is far closer to normal than it was a year ago and the United States is better prepared to handle any resurgence of Covid-19 in the fall. There are plenty of vaccinations to go around, though again, politics appears to be threatening the common good with refusal to take such precautions a badge of honor among some grassroots conservatives. Washington may not be as irredeemably broken as it seems. Since last year, Republicans and Democrats have combined to pass a huge new law fixing the country\u2019s aging infrastructure \u2013 a task that evaded recent presidents before Biden. And after a deal between Republicans and Democrats, the Senate passed one of the most sweeping firearms safety laws in a generation. The measure might have fallen far short of the pleas of grief-stricken family members of the mass shooting victims in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas. But it was a sign that even in this vicious political climate, incremental change fashioned through political institutions is not impossible. For the first time in two decades, Americans are not fighting major wars abroad. And Biden\u2019s leadership of the West in standing up to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine may represent the most significant show of American global leadership since the Cold War. The bravery of those who stood up to Trump\u2019s attempt to steal power in 2020 is also an inspiration this July Fourth. Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House January 6 committee, may alienate liberals with her political views, but she\u2019s written herself a place in history by standing up for democracy, unlike many of her genuflecting GOP rivals who run perpetually scared from Trump. Cassidy Hutchinson, a former Trump White House aide, put far more senior colleagues to shame by showing how one person can take a stand for truth with her televised testimony before the House committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. And if the majority of the country that didn\u2019t want to see Roe reversed wants an example of turning demoralizing defeat into eventual victory, they can look to the years of activism by the anti-abortion movement to see how political change can be forged by generations of campaigners who stay committed to the goal. Because this July Fourth, America still does have a democratic political system that can be shaped by the people. At least, it does for now.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: A previous version of this story appeared on March 26, 2012. With recent decisions on abortion, gun control, religious freedom and the environment, the US Supreme Court once again reasserted its central role in America. The nine justices are unelected, serve for life and until recently were all White men. But their actions have helped define the American way of life for more than two centuries. Here are several common questions about the court, its makeup and its power: In essence, the court decides if laws and government actions are constitutional and outlines the breadth and limits of government. When a case reaches the Supreme Court, typically through a process of several years, it\u2019s important because the precedent the majority opinion sets is then the standard by which future laws are measured. That\u2019s due to the principle of \u201cstare decisis,\u201d Latin for \u201cto stand by a decision,\u201d where a current court should be bound by previous rulings. Yes, in the sense that they can\u2019t be overturned by another body. But no, in the sense that the court can overturn or change its own precedent over time, as it did with odious decisions allowing racial segregation or with last month\u2019s reversal of the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which had guarantee the constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Not directly, but Congress can pass laws that respond to rulings. For instance, the court ruled in 2007 that Lilly Ledbetter had not filed an equal pay discrimination complaint within the allowed time period (because she had not discovered the discrepancy until years later). President Barack Obama signed a law in 2009 that eliminated those previous restrictions. The Supreme Court interprets the Constitution, so amending the document changes how the court is able to rule. But amending the Constitution is a herculean political task requiring, in theory, mass public support, which doesn\u2019t exist for either party at the moment. No. They\u2019re appointed by the president, and then sent to the Senate to be confirmed. Nine. Each has an equal vote. Chief Justice John Roberts (George W. Bush, 2005). Justice Clarence Thomas (George H.W. Bush, 1991). Justice Samuel Alito (GWB, 2006). Justice Sonia Sotomayor (Barack Obama, 2009). Justice Elena Kagan (Obama, 2010). Justice Neil Gorsuch (Donald Trump, 2017). Justice Brett Kavanaugh (Trump, 2018). Justice Amy Coney Barrett (Trump, 2020). Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson (Joe Biden, 2022). Luck and politics. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama each served for eight years and got two justices confirmed each. Trump served one term and appointed three: one because Obama\u2019s final nominee in 2016 was blocked by Republicans, one due to a retirement and one, just before the 2020 presidential election, due to the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. No. It\u2019s most common for nominees to now have strong legal pedigrees (Ivy League law school, experience clerking for previous justices or experience on federal appeals courts) but none of that is required. Kagan was a Harvard Law professor and solicitor general (a top Justice Department attorney) but was never a judge. The late Chief Justice Earl Warren had been the governor of California. Yes, as are the judges for other federal courts, and they can serve until death or retirement. It means they\u2019re in theory insulated from the whims of the political branches. But it doesn\u2019t make the justices popular: Current polls show that fewer than one-third of Americans have confidence in the court. Yes, via impeachment \u2013 the same process used to remove a US president. The House would vote to impeach, and the Senate would have a trial and vote on whether to remove the justice. It\u2019s never happened for a Supreme Court justice, however. The Constitution doesn\u2019t say how many justices the court must have, but the number has been set at nine since the mid-19th century and codified into law since. In theory, the president can nominate and the Senate can confirm more justices to swing the court in a desired direction. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt suggested this in the 1930s after the court had struck down many of his \u201cNew Deal\u201d policies. Recently faced with a court that has six conservatives and three liberals, Democratic politicians have suggested adding several more justices to tilt the balance of power. The Supreme Court first met in 1790, as the highest court in the judicial branch of government. The justices are led by the chief justice of the United States (that\u2019s the official title). The court has occupied its current building in Washington only since 1935. Previously, it borrowed space in Senate chambers in the US Capitol. Traditionally, each term begins the first Monday in October, and final opinions are usually issued by late June. Justices divide their time between \u201csittings,\u201d where they hear cases and issue decisions, and \u201crecesses,\u201d where they meet in private to write their decisions and consider other business before the court. Behind the scenes at the secretive Supreme Court In the courtroom, justices are seated by seniority, with the chief justice in the middle and the junior-most justices on the outside. Before public arguments and private conferences, where decisions are discussed, the nine members all shake hands as a show of harmony of purpose. As the gavel sounds and the justices are seated, the marshal shouts the traditional welcome, which reads: \u201cOyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to draw near and give their attention, for the court is now sitting. God save the United States and this honorable court.\u201d Since most cases involve appellate review of decisions by other courts, there are no juries or witnesses, just lawyers from both sides addressing the bench. The arguments usually last about an hour, and lawyers from both sides very often have their prepared oral briefs interrupted by pointed questions from justices. In recent years, the court has given each justice five minutes to ask questions, going in order from the chief justice to the most junior. This give-and-take, question-and-answer repartee requires lawyers to think concisely and logically on their feet. And the tone of the questioning often gives insight into a justice\u2019s thinking, a barometer of his/her decision-making. After the arguments, conferences are scheduled, where justices discuss and vote on the cases. In these closed-door sessions, the nine members are alone. No clerks or staff are allowed. No transcripts are kept. Conservative justices seized the moment and delivered the opinion they'd long promised Justices spend much of their time reviewing the cases and writing opinions. And they must decide which cases they will hear in open court. When asked just before her 2006 retirement what the jurists do most of the time, Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor said bluntly, \u201cWe read. We read on average 1,500 pages a day. We read. Sometimes we write.\u201d Added Justice Antonin Scalia: \u201cWe try to squeeze in a little time for thinking.\u201d Cameras are not allowed, and until the Covid-19 pandemic, live audio for oral arguments wasn\u2019t available either, meaning that the actions of nine men and women that can impact every aspect of American life happen in the shadows.

            "article_content": "Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s majority opinion ending a federal right to abortion is the culmination of a legal career in which he has cast doubt on the grounds on which Roe v. Wade was decided. In his opinion \u2013 which mirrored the leaked draft published by Politico in May \u2013 Alito writes that Roe \u201cmust be overruled\u201d and was \u201cegregiously wrong from the start.\u201d Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade Born in Trenton, New Jersey, Alito was nominated by former President George W. Bush to succeed Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor and ascended to the high court in 2006. He clerked for Leonard I. Garth, judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit from 1976-1977 before becoming assistant US attorney for the District of New Jersey. In 1981, he became assistant to the solicitor general for the Department of Justice. During his time at the Justice Department, he outlined in a 1985 memo how the Reagan administration could approach its stance on limiting abortion, writing, \u201cwe should make clear that we disagree with Roe v. Wade and would welcome the opportunity to brief the issue of-whether, and if so to what extent, that decision should be overruled.\u201d During his Senate confirmation hearings in 2006, Alito was asked about Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a 1991 case during his time as a judge of the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Newark, New Jersey. The case struck down a Pennsylvania law that required women seeking abortions to notify their husband and in which he was the only dissenter. The ruling was later upheld by the Supreme Court. He was also asked about a letter in his 1985 application to be deputy assistant to the US attorney general. \u201cI am particularly proud of my contributions in recent cases in which the government has argued in the Supreme Court that racial and ethnic quotas should not be allowed and that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion,\u201d Alito wrote at the time. Samuel Alito lashes out at liberals in guns case as tensions boil over at SCOTUS Alito defended his comments in the application, saying during the 2006 hearing, \u201cthat was a statement that I made at a prior period of time when I was performing a different role\u201d and that he would keep an open mind if the issue came before him on the Supreme Court. \u201cAnd as I said yesterday, when someone becomes a judge, you really have to put aside the things that you did as a lawyer at prior points in your legal career and think about legal issues the way a judge thinks about legal issues,\u201d he said. One year after his appointment, the court reversed course on an abortion controversy, upholding by a 5-4 vote a federal ban on a late-term procedure that critics called \u201cpartial birth.\u201d In an earlier case, while O\u2019Connor was still on the bench, the justices had struck down a similar state ban as interfering with a woman\u2019s right to end a pregnancy. (Some medical experts have said the procedure, known medically as intact dilation and extraction, was the safest for women in certain circumstances.) During his tenure on the court, Alito has drafted some of the court\u2019s most controversial opinions, including the 2007 Lilly Ledbetter pay-discrimination case, and sided with the majority on landmark decisions. He also sided with the 5-4 majority in a ruling on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which removed long-established legal limits on campaign spending by corporations and unions. The decision prompted sharp criticism from then-President Barack Obama during the State of the Union address in which Alito mouthed the words \u201cnot true,\u201d a rare show of emotion from a Supreme Court justice who generally remains stoic during the addresses. And in 2014, Alito crafted the court\u2019s 5-4 opinion to allow a Hobby Lobby craft chain and other Christian-run for-profit corporations to escape an Obama administration rule that their insurance cover contraceptives. The regulation arose from the 2010 Affordable Care Act. Key lines from Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade Alito wrote that the court\u2019s conservative majority rejected the argument by the Department of Health and Human Services that \u201cthe owners of the companies forfeited all (Religious Freedom Restoration Act) protection when they decided to organize their businesses as corporations rather than sole proprietorships or general partnerships.\u201d \u201cThe plain terms of RFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to run their businesses as for-profit corporations in the manner required by their religious beliefs,\u201d Alito wrote. This story has been updated following the publication of the opinion striking down Roe v. Wade.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Party leaders are meeting this week to hear pitches from 16 states and Puerto Rico, which want to hold the first presidential nominating contests in 2024, as the party moves forward with reevaluating its primary schedule. The focus will especially be on Iowa, which is proposing dramatic changes to its complicated system as it aims to maintain its \u201cfirst in the nation\u201d status in the face of criticism of the caucus process and of the state\u2019s lack of diversity and competitiveness at the presidential level. Democratic Party officials earlier this year approved a plan that requires any state that wants to hold a nominating contest before the first Tuesday in March \u2013 including the traditional early four of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2013 to apply for permission. In the coming weeks, the Rules and Bylaws Committee will select up to five states using criteria that prioritize diverse battlegrounds that choose to hold primaries, not caucuses. That decision will then need to be approved by the full Democratic National Committee. Because the party is aiming to have every region of the country represented among the early group of states, and the positions of New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina are generally considered to be secure, it\u2019s expected there will be fierce competition among other Midwestern states to be the alternative to Iowa. Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois are jockeying for that spot, but all three bids have potential problems of their own. Iowa\u2019s proposal to the Rules and Bylaws Committee, the body tasked with setting the party\u2019s nominating rules, calls for several simplifications to the caucus process. \u201cWe recognize that caucuses, as they have been conducted since the 1970s, are no longer aligned with a vibrant and just twenty-first century democracy. In order to continue growing our party, we need to make changes,\u201d the party\u2019s application reads. No longer would Iowa Democrats have to gather on a weekday evening and separate into groups to indicate which candidates they support. Instead, caucusgoers would receive presidential preference cards in the weeks leading up to caucus night, which they would fill out and return. On caucus night itself, those results would be reported and the caucuses themselves would be more focused on party business. The change would also eliminate the process of \u201crealignment,\u201d where if candidates didn\u2019t hit a threshold of support, their backers would be able to select second choices. Under the proposed plan, Iowa Democrats would get only a single choice. The Iowa Democratic Party proposed contracting with an outside company or with election officials to run the process, a response to the organizational and communications problems that plagued its 2020 caucuses. The new plan would also eliminate much of the complicated math that volunteer caucus leaders have had to do, another element that caused issues in 2020. Iowa\u2019s application also tries to answer other criticisms from party leaders \u2013 especially that the state is too White to be reflective of a diversifying national party and that the state, which former President Donald Trump won by 8 percentage points in 2020, is no longer politically competitive. While the application acknowledges that Iowa\u2019s racial breakdown doesn\u2019t mirror the nation\u2019s, it points to the state\u2019s rural Latino communities and more diverse urban school districts as evidence that there \u201care diverse communities living, thriving, and dealing with complex political issues\u201d in Iowa. The application argues that Iowa presents a vital opportunity for Democrats to connect with rural voters who have shifted away from the party in the recent years and that without its early status, the state would continue to move toward Republicans. State parties had until June 3 to submit their applications. Earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee invited 16 states and Puerto Rico to move forward with the application process. New York, Nebraska and the group Democrats Abroad were the only applicants who didn\u2019t make the cut. This week, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Texas and Washington will make presentations to the Rules and Bylaws Committee. As Democratic parties in the states gear up for this week\u2019s meeting, the Michigan Democratic Party released a trailer-like video narrated by former Detroit Pistons star Isiah Thomas. The video pitched Michigan as the \u201cbest place to pick a president\u201d and highlighted the Wolverine State\u2019s diversity as well as its agriculture and automobile industries. Likewise, Minnesota released a promotional video narrated by St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter that emphasizes the state\u2019s diversity, touts that it was the first Midwestern state to legalize same-sex marriage via legislation and calls itself \u201cdemocracy\u2019s North Star.\u201d But while Minnesota and Michigan are competitive and diverse, Democrats would need cooperation from Republicans \u2013 the state GOP in Minnesota or the Republican-controlled legislature in Michigan, to change the primary date. That process could be complicated because national Republicans don\u2019t plan on disturbing Iowa\u2019s place at the head of their calendar. On the other hand, Illinois is a large, heavily Democratic state that\u2019s anchored by a single major metropolitan area \u2013 all factors that could weigh against its bid.",

            "article_content": "A lot of attention has been paid to the problems President Joe Biden and other Democrats have with core party constituencies, including young and Hispanic voters. And there\u2019s been plenty of polling to back that up. Far less attention, though, has been paid to potential declines in Democrats\u2019 standing among groups for which polling is more limited. Getting data on these groups usually requires aggregating polls and looking at trends in real-world elections. I\u2019ve noted, for instance, Biden\u2019s declining approval rating with Black adults. But what about Asian American voters, who made up only 4% of the electorate in 2020? Asian Americans are the fastest-growing racial or ethnic portion of the electorate, which makes them electorally important. And that\u2019s where we begin our statistical journey today. My interest in examining Asian American voters within the context of the larger electorate came about because of what has arguably been the political earthquake of the year thus far \u2013 the June 7 recall of progressive District Attorney Chesa Boudin in deep-blue San Francisco. One big reason Boudin went down to defeat: Asian American voters. That election result and other data reveal that Asians are still likely to vote Democratic on the whole, but the party has seen a disproportionate decline in support among this group. Let\u2019s start with the national polling. As I mentioned at the top, it\u2019s hard to get national polling that tracks Asian voters specifically. I would therefore take these trends as preliminary. Pew Research Center polling, however, does show that Biden\u2019s standing with Asians has dropped precipitously. He\u2019s averaged a 53% approval rating and a 47% disapproval rating (or a +7 net approval rating, without rounding) in 2022 data. Biden won Asian voters by 44 points in 2020, according to Pew data. In other words, his net approval margin with Asian adults now is 37 points lower than his margin over Republican Donald Trump among Asian voters in 2020. That\u2019s far greater than the drop he\u2019s had with the electorate overall. Biden\u2019s net approval rating has averaged about -14 points this year in Pew polling. He won the 2020 election by a little less than 5 points, according to Pew data. That puts his net approval rating about 19 points lower than his margin over Trump in 2020. A peek at the generic congressional ballot shows that these trends are not happening in a vacuum. Pew\u2019s March poll gave Democrats a 28-point advantage among Asians on the ballot test, which asks voters which party they would support for Congress in their districts. That\u2019s 16 points lower than the margin Biden won them by in 2020. The same generic ballot had Democrats and Republicans tied among all voters, which is only about a 5-point drop for Democrats overall compared with Biden\u2019s 2020 margin. So the dip in Democratic support among Asian voters looks to be about 3 times as large as it is overall. The Cooperative Election Study, a large academic data set, showed something quite similar in its late 2021 survey. Biden\u2019s net approval rating was +15 points among Asians who said they had voted in the 2020 election. The same group said they had voted for Biden by +38 points. That\u2019s a 23-point dip. Biden\u2019s overall net approval rating was -7 points among those who said they had voted in the 2020 election. He beat Trump by about 3.5 points among this group. This makes for about a 10-point drop. This means Biden was down more than twice as much among Asians than among voters overall. And like with the Pew data, the generic ballot, according to the Cooperative Election Study, reflects what Biden\u2019s approval rating would suggest: a disproportionate Democratic drop with Asian voters. Democrats led the 2022 generic ballot by 29 points among Asians who said they had voted in the 2020 election. That\u2019s a 9-point drop from Biden\u2019s 2020 margin. Among all voters who said they had cast ballots in 2020, Democrats led by 3.4 points. Ergo, the margin was the same for the 2022 congressional ballot test as it was for the 2020 ballot test. This isn\u2019t just a polling phenomenon. Let\u2019s go back to San Francisco, which ranks in the top 10 US counties with the highest percentages of Asian residents. Specifically, we\u2019ll concentrate on precincts where Asians make up at least 75% of the population. Support for the recall reached at least 60% in all these precincts and north of 70% in a number of them, as you can see from data collected by Chris Arvin. There was a clear positive correlation between how many Asians resided in a precinct and how many votes there were to recall Boudin. That was not the case for any other racial or ethnic group. Those same precincts still gave Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom more than 60% of the vote in this year\u2019s top-two gubernatorial primary. It\u2019s not like they are full-blown Republican or anything like that. Queens County, New York, which is another top 10 Asian county, is showing similar signs. Check out what happened in the New York City mayoral election last year. Democrat Eric Adams easily defeated Republican Curtis Sliwa. His victory margin of 39 points was the same as Democrat Bill de Blasio\u2019s over Republican Nicole Malliotakis in 2017. The heavily Asian precincts (or election districts) in Queens, the most Asian borough in New York, tell a different story. Adams won Queens precincts that are at least 75% Asian by 16 points. De Blasio won those same precincts by 34 points, according to data collected by Matthew Thomas. That is, the Democratic margin dropped by half from 2017 to 2021. Again, I would view this data as preliminary, though it\u2019s pretty consistent. And while Asian Americans are a small slice of the electorate, the fact that their numbers are growing and Democrats need all the help they can get right now makes this another worrisome data point for them ahead of the 2022 and 2024 elections. Speaking of Democrats being in trouble, it\u2019s not good news for them anytime a Democrat can reasonably be compared to former President Jimmy Carter during his time in office. But it\u2019s tough to not see some of the similarities between the Carter presidency and the Biden one. At the most basic level, Biden was elected to restore dignity to the White House after the Trump years. Carter was elected to restore dignity and trust after Watergate and Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. Biden\u2019s presidency has hit a major roadblock in large part because of inflation. Inflation is worse right now than in any election year at this point since 1980 (when Carter would go on to lose to Ronald Reagan). Biden\u2019s approval rating on inflation stood at 23% in a Fox poll out last week. Carter\u2019s was 22% in a Gallup poll the July before the 1978 midterms. (Biden\u2019s disapproval rating of 71% is actually higher than Carter\u2019s 66%.) Gas accessibility was a major problem for both men. Right now, gas prices are up more than 60% from where they were a year ago, and Biden\u2019s approval rating on the issue is in the 20s. Carter saw his poll numbers decline because of a gas shortage. The problems with inflation and gasoline have spurred a lack of consumer confidence. The preliminary June consumer sentiment index from the University of Michigan was lower than it has been since the survey started in 1952. The previous lows were in 1980, just before Carter was defeated for reelection. Carter\u2019s issues back then spurred talk of a primary challenge, as they have for Biden. Of course, Biden\u2019s and Carter\u2019s trajectories do have their differences. Some of them are good for Biden, and others aren\u2019t nearly as good. Carter\u2019s plight within his own party was considerably worse than Biden\u2019s current status. Carter was already trailing in polls for the nomination against Ted Kennedy at this point in 1978. Biden is still ahead of the Democratic field, even if he is polling below 50%. Perhaps most relevant for this year, Carter\u2019s net approval rating overall was positive (if barely) at this point in his tenure. Biden\u2019s is -15 points. It wasn\u2019t until later in his presidency that Carter\u2019s popularity bottomed out. This allowed for his Democratic Party to limit its losses in the 1978 midterms and maintain its majorities in the House and Senate. Biden\u2019s unpopularity, along with significantly smaller Democratic majorities in the House and Senate than Carter had in 1978, will likely sink his party in these midterms. Put another way, Biden is likely to have a far worse midterm election this year than Carter did in 1978. Biden, though, is only in the second year of his presidency, so he has time to turn things around. The worst of the economic crisis occurred in Carter\u2019s reelection year, while the current difficulties of the economy may be improving by the time Biden\u2019s name is potentially on the ballot again, in 2024. To all the fathers out there, hopefully your children treat you right. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t think your day is as important as the day for their mother. A 2012 CBS News survey found that 72% of Americans said Mother\u2019s Day was more important to them when asked to choose between that and Father\u2019s Day. Only 13% picked Father\u2019s Day. Ten percent opted for the middle ground (thinking both days were equally important). Juneteenth knowledge grows: Sunday also marks Juneteenth. This year, 59% told Gallup they have a lot or some knowledge of the holiday. Last year, only 37% did. Moreover, 63% believe Juneteenth should be taught in public schools \u2013 up from 49% last year. Belief in God hits record low: A different Gallup poll found that 81% of Americans now believe in God. That\u2019s down from 92% in 2011 and 98% in 1967. Only 68% of Americans under the age of 30 and 62% of liberals believe in God. Twitter is for politics: A new Pew report shows that 33% of tweets from American adults are political in nature. This includes 44% of retweets.",

            "article_content": "With political power on the line, state redistricting commissions have been held up by voter advocates as a way to get congressional districts that are more reflective of the communities that live in them. But as states redrew the political maps that will shape elections for the next decade, those that set up commissions didn\u2019t necessarily produce fairer redistricting plans. The latest round of legislative map-drawing, produced from 2020 census data, featured the input of commissions in more than a dozen states, with the use of commissions expanding since the previous decennial cycle. A 2019 Supreme Court decision that said federal courts could not police extreme gerrymanders made such commissions a critical tool for voter advocates. Gerrymandering: How it's being exposed and how it affects your state The issue: Not all redistricting commissions are created equally. Only some of the commissions set up for the 2020 cycle were truly independent, and how they were designed affected how functional \u2013 or dysfunctional \u2013 they were. \u201cWhen the commission is not fully independent and not fully made up of just citizens, then it\u2019s less likely to function properly,\u201d said Mark Gaber, the senior redistricting director for the Campaign Legal Center. Michigan\u2019s commission \u2013 a citizen-driven entity that was set up by a 2018 ballot initative \u2013 was seen as a notable success story in how it produced redistricting plans that will be competitive for Democrats in a purple state that previously saw extreme GOP-favored gerrymandering. On the flip side was Ohio, where the redistricting system was also overhauled by a voter-approved 2018 constitutional amendment. That commission \u2013 which was made up entirely of elected politicians, a majority of whom are Republican \u2013 has seen its maps repeatedly rejected by the state Supreme Court for its failure to meet the requirements of the reform initiative. \u201cOhio is sort of like the poster child for like the worst of all worlds,\u201d said Michael Li, a senior counsel for the democracy program at the Brennan Center, a voting rights and criminal justice reform think tank at New York University School of Law. Here are key lessons from the performance of various redistricting commissions across the country and where they worked best. Whether a supposedly independent redistricting commission was truly independent depended on who got the final say about the maps it put forward. In four states, advisory commissions draw draft congressional maps, but it\u2019s ultimately up to the state legislature whether the proposed maps will be adopted. Only Maine\u2019s legislature did so. \u201cSadly, most of those state legislatures essentially disregarded the good work of the advisory commissions,\u201d said Kathay Feng, the national redistricting director at the voting rights organization Common Cause. Republicans in New Mexico accused the Democratic-controlled legislature of largely ignoring the work of its advisory citizen commission, though a GOP lawsuit was unsuccessful in blocking the congressional plan the legislature adopted. And in Utah, where the advisory commission\u2019s congressional and state district plans were eschewed by the state lawmakers, similar litigation is underway. \u201cThe sort of advisory commissions clearly don\u2019t work,\u201d Gaber told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s not enough \u2026 without good actors on the other side, who are going to pay heed to it.\u201d It was also tough for a commission to be truly independent if its membership included politicians, voter advocates say, holding up Ohio\u2019s commission as the chief example. The commission \u2013 formed after the legislature hashed out a compromise measure to counter a citizen-driven initiative \u2013 is made up of majority and minority members of Ohio\u2019s legislature, as well as three statewide officials, who were all Republican this cycle. Its work has been a total disaster, with the state Supreme Court repeatedly refusing to OK the commission\u2019s congressional and state legislative plans for their failure to comply with the constitutional amendment. But the commission has now run down the clock on fixing the maps for the 2022 election, meaning voters will likely cast ballots in districts that the state\u2019s highest court has deemed illegal. \u201cWhen the commission is made up of or includes politicians, then dysfunction is going to occur,\u201d Gaber said, citing both the partisan interests and the personal conflicts around protecting their own seats. The redistricting commission Virginia \u2013 where an even number of Democratic and Republican lawmakers joined the eight citizen members \u2013 also was racked with dysfunction, though with a less chaotic resolution. When the commission stalemated, the Virginia Supreme Court was able to intervene and produce maps. Virginia Democratic state Sen. Mamie Locke said that the presence of lawmakers on the commission was partially to blame for its failure to come to an agreement. Locke, a member of the commission herself, told CNN that the desire to protect partisan advantage, as well as to protect individual incumbents, undermined the process. \u201cIf I had to do it all over again, I\u2019m not sure that I would have had legislators on the commission,\u201d she told CNN, adding that the citizen members would have also benefited from more training. The sway a legislature has on selecting citizen members can also undermine commissions State Sen. William M. Stanley Jr., a Virginia Republican who served on the commission, countered that he believed that lawmakers would have ultimately reached an agreement, but that citizen members were not prepared for how to forge consensus \u201cthrough long hours, through frustrating moments.\u201d He also said that the role the legislature played in picking the citizen members also created problems. Other commissions, like New York\u2019s, gave lawmakers a prominent role in shaping citizen-led commissions. The New York advisory commission put forward competing maps from its Democrat- and Republican-affiliated members, but failed to submit a follow-up recommendation. That gave the Democratic-controlled legislature the opportunity to draw a heavily gerrymandered plan that was thrown out by a state court. California's new congressional maps produce a scrambled playing field for 2022 During the Colorado commissioner selection process, lawmakers got to narrow the pool of potential citizens members, and \u201cto some extent, the commissioners did wear their partisan hats just a little bit more actively,\u201d Feng said. \u201cOn certain key issues, then, sometimes those commissioners will divide along partisan lines or they\u2019ll get into a very, very heated arguments with each other along partisan lines,\u201d Feng said. Meanwhile, the member-selection processes for Michigan\u2019s and California\u2019s citizen commissions were more resistant to the influence of legislature, which likely contributed to those commissions\u2019 success in crafting plans that became the ultimate maps. \u201cIn California, a list is prepared of qualified people and lawmakers get a certain number of strikes, similar to jury strikes,\u201d Li said. \u201cSo, the California system is very hard to game.\u201d A silver lining of the dysfunction around Virginia\u2019s commission is that the state Supreme Court had the opportunity to remedy the stalemate, and ultimately produced maps more competitive for Republicans than the old plans. \u201cOne of the upsides, even when you have a lousy commission, is that you have created enough of a record for the court to review and be able to create some alternative that is fair,\u201d Feng said. The court\u2019s involvement could make the Virginia commission in future cycles \u201cmore mindful of the need to draw the maps through the commission and get a consensus, then to continually let the Supreme Court make those decisions for them,\u201d Stanley said. The congressional map for New York that a court recently adopted has, like Virginia\u2019s, been generally viewed by the voting rights community as fair and more competitive than the last cycle\u2019s redistricting plan. Republicans will able to compete in several of the state\u2019s 26 congressional seats, in addition to the five districts that lean towards GOP. The court battle has gotten ugliest in Ohio, where voters will be casting ballots in congressional districts that the state Supreme Court says were unconstitutionally drawn. Feng pointed to an \u201cescape hatch\u201d the legislature created in the competing proposal it put forward for creating a commission, where \u201ceven if a partisan or racial gerrymander has been found, a court may not impose a remedy by itself.\u201d \u201cIt has to go back to the legislature to be drawn,\u201d Feng said. \u201cAnd so that circular, multi-layered stages of Dante\u2019s Hell has been imposed on Ohio.\u201d Some of the problems commissions faced, particularly in New York and Ohio, were a product of assumptions about politics that were made when the commission was designed. \u201cSometimes you can overthink these things,\u201d Li said. \u201cAnd you can design things like for a world that just doesn\u2019t exist anymore, because politics change.\u201d When New York voters approved of the proposal in 2014 that created its advisory commission, Republicans effectively controlled the state Senate, and in theory, divided state government would be incentivized to defer to the commission\u2019s proposal, according to Li. \u201cBut in a world where Democrats have sole control of the process, the Democrats have an incentive to vote down the commission maps,\u201d Li said, since the Democratic-controlled legislature would then get to draw its own. In Ohio, maps passed on a party-line basis are only good for two cycles, which would be more of a risk for Republicans if Ohio was the swing state it once was. \u201cOhio\u2019s reforms were designed for the assumption that Ohio was a battleground state, and it just isn\u2019t anymore,\u201d Li said. \u201cAnd now Republicans are like, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll pass a map. It\u2019s only good for four years, and then we\u2019ll redraw the map in four years. We don\u2019t have a problem with that.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. With the first public hearing investigating the January 6 insurrection on Thursday, an important question has resurfaced: Just how close is the US to breaking down into conflict? In some ways, the attack should\u2019ve been a wake-up call, and an opportunity for Republican voters and their leaders to distance themselves from Donald Trump. After all, a sitting president had exhorted his acolytes to lay siege to the US Capitol and overturn the results of an election. Yet more than a year after the breach, the potential for violent political struggle has hardly receded \u2013 and that\u2019s at least in part because of the state of partisanship in the US. Some Republican voters continue to falsely believe that Joe Biden stole the 2020 contest from Trump, and too many GOP lawmakers have used the Big Lie to support their efforts to pursue aggressive gerrymanders and pass restrictive voting laws \u2013 to shut their Democratic rivals out of power. Maybe even more worrying is the fact that the country\u2019s two main political parties are increasingly organized \u201cinto nearly warring factions with radically opposed visions for America,\u201d the political scientists Nathan P. Kalmoe and Lilliana Mason write in their compelling new book, \u201cRadical American Partisanship: Mapping Violent Hostility, Its Causes, and the Consequences for Democracy.\u201d While the Democratic Party is \u201ca pluralistic multiracial party,\u201d Kalmoe and Mason continue, the GOP \u201chas been overtaken by those who long for the stricter racial hierarchies of the old white South, who envision a Christian theocracy, and who steer government benefits to the rich.\u201d Little wonder, then, that so many experts warn against downplaying the possibility of fresh political violence. To further discuss present-day partisanship and its effects, I spoke with Mason, an associate professor of political science at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s SNF Agora Institute. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. In the book, you and Nathan P. Kalmoe argue that it was easy for Donald Trump to incite an insurrection because of how the bases of the country\u2019s two main political parties are divided. Could you describe these divisions a bit more? Part of the reason that partisan animosity between Democrats and Republicans is so terrible right now is because what the parties are fighting over are really matters of racial and gender equality \u2013 the traditional social hierarchy \u2013 and whether we\u2019re going to go back to being a country where White Christian men were always at the top of that hierarchy or become a more egalitarian, multiethnic democracy. A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting power What we found in our data was that, particularly on the right, Republicans who really hated Democrats the most were also the highest in racial resentment and sexism. And those who hated Democrats the least were those who were lowest in racial resentment and sexism. Actually, in our data, racial resentment is one of the most powerful predictors of Republicans hating Democrats. The reason I think that matters is that in general, as a country, we haven\u2019t been very good at talking about racism or sexism in a nonviolent and calm and collected way. How do people become radical partisans? We think about it in two different ways. The first is what we call \u201cmoral disengagement,\u201d which is basically vilifying and dehumanizing people in the other party. And we look at that because in other places and in other contexts, these vilifying and dehumanizing beliefs tend to precede mass violence. Whenever there\u2019s a mass violent event between groups of people, that usually happens after people have already decided that people in the other group are evil and subhuman. That\u2019s one set of attitudes that we think of as a warning sign. We\u2019ve also just explicitly asked, \u201cTo what extent do you think that it\u2019s acceptable to use violence to achieve political goals?\u201d That\u2019s less of a warning sign and more actually the real thing. And what we\u2019re seeing is that increasing numbers of American partisans believe that violence is sometimes acceptable when they\u2019re trying to achieve political outcomes. Not all those people are going to participate in violence. They just approve of it. But what that approval does is create a social environment around them where if they know somebody who might be more unstable and participate in violence, they\u2019re hearing fewer people say that\u2019s not acceptable. In the run-up to the public hearings investigating the January 6 insurrection, Trump insisted that his allies circle the wagons. His machinations reminded me of how Barbara Walter describes today\u2019s Republican Party in her new book, \u201cHow Civil Wars Start: And How to Stop Them\u201d: \u201c(The GOP) is primarily ethnic and religious based. It has supported a populist who pursued white nationalist policies at the expense of other citizens, and it has elevated personality above principle.\u201d What role do political leaders play in inflaming or extinguishing conflict? Political leader rhetoric is really, really important. And what we found repeatedly across multiple studies is that just having people read a statement from Joe Biden or Trump that says, \u201cViolence is never acceptable\u201d or something like that reduces people\u2019s approval of violence. And all they have to do is just read a sentence from Biden or Trump. Republicans are more responsive to Trump, but they\u2019re actually also responsive to Biden. What we need, in particular, is more leaders reminding people that violence is not part of a functioning democracy. It doesn\u2019t fit with the peaceful transition of power \u2013 one of the required elements of democracy. How do we confront these democratic threats? One of the things that happened during Trump\u2019s presidency, and even the campaign in 2016, was that we saw norms shifting. Whereas previously politicians wouldn\u2019t, in general, say explicitly racist or sexist things in public, Trump decided to just start doing that and therefore kind of broke the norms around how we talk about our fellow Americans. He also kind of changed the norms around questions of: What does it mean to be a responsible member of a democracy? How do we engage one other? What kind of respect do we owe one another? All of those norms kind of went out the window. When leaders undermine norms, it can have a really large effect, because norms aren\u2019t institutionalized. There\u2019s no law about them. The only way norms are enforced is through social pressure. If you break norms, you know that because the people around you tell you that you shouldn\u2019t do that. You get sanctioned by the people you rely on for your social life. So, if the leader stops enforcing those norms, then the followers stop enforcing those norms, and then the norms can actually just disappear. Once we see leaders modeling behavior that\u2019s no longer respectful or thoughtful or responsible, we end up with a huge number of Americans who no longer believe that it\u2019s their responsibility to be respectful or thoughtful or responsible when they engage their fellow Americans. In fact, one of the things that came out of MAGA fans is this division over who gets to be an American: Certain people deserve your respect, while other Americans, particularly people who tend to come from marginalized groups, don\u2019t deserve it. They don\u2019t count as Americans. What should we keep in mind as the public hearings unfold? It\u2019s very clear that Trump is trying to dissuade his supporters from paying attention to the hearings at all. That\u2019s likely because there will be some relatively compelling information that comes out of them. One of the things that happened after January 6 was that the Republican Party tried to minimize it in every way possible: It wasn\u2019t Trump supporters; it was Antifa. Or: It wasn\u2019t actually violent. Or: It was just tourists walking around. There were multiple approaches to trying to minimize it. But Republicans were doing that because they knew that it was extremely damaging for them, as a party, to have a mob of partisans from one party violently attack the seat of US government. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been really pushing their supporters not to pay attention to it. What we know from our data is that the faction of Americans who really like Trump and are really intolerant of other Americans is about 30% of the country. Even if they watch the hearings, the people in that group probably won\u2019t change their minds. But perhaps bringing January 6 up again will remind everyone else \u2013 the 70% of America \u2013 that this was a really dangerous event. And it wasn\u2019t inevitable that Biden would be inaugurated. It was very, very uncertain. Reminding Americans of that is an important thing to do because if we stop remembering what the stakes are, we take politics less seriously, and we\u2019re at a precarious moment in terms of the persistence of a democratic system of government.",

            "article_content": "An earthquake is building in Tuesday\u2019s California elections that could rattle the political landscape from coast to coast. In Los Angeles and San Francisco, two of the nation\u2019s most liberal large cities, voters are poised to send stinging messages of discontent over mounting public disorder, as measured in both upticks in certain kinds of crime and pervasive homelessness. That dissatisfaction could translate into the recall of San Francisco\u2019s left-leaning district attorney, Chesa Boudin, likely by a resounding margin, and a strong showing in the Los Angeles mayoral primary by Rick Caruso, a billionaire real estate developer and former Republican who has emerged as the leading alternative in the race to Democratic US Rep. Karen Bass, once considered the front-runner. Linking both these contests \u2013 as well as several Los Angeles City Council races and an ongoing effort to recall George Gascon, Los Angeles County\u2019s left-leaning district attorney \u2013 is a widespread sense among voters in both cities that local government is failing at its most basic responsibility: to ensure public safety and order. It\u2019s a sentiment similar to the anxiety over urban disarray that inspired the \u201cbroken windows\u201d policing theory during the 1980s, and contributed to the election of Republican Mayors Rudy Giuliani and Richard Riordan in New York and Los Angeles, respectively, amid the cascading violence of the crack epidemic in the early 1990s. 8 things to watch in Tuesday's primaries Tuesday\u2019s California results will likely send a stark message to the Democrats controlling Congress and the White House. The outcome will again underscore how much danger a party in power can face when voters feel that certainty has been stripped from their lives \u2013 a dynamic that extends beyond crime and homelessness to inflation, soaring gasoline prices and continued disruption from the unending Covid pandemic. \u201cIn the broadest perspective, the voters and residents are feeling that the governing regime, the liberal Democratic regime that has dominated LA for the last 30 years, and California and San Francisco, is not meeting the moment,\u201d says Fernando Guerra, a political scientist who directs the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University. Zev Yaroslavsky, who served on the LA City Council and then the LA County Board of Supervisors for almost 40 years starting in 1975, says the only time he can remember Los Angeles voters as discontented as they are today was in the late 1970s, an era of high inflation and soaring property tax bills that produced California\u2019s Proposition 13 and the tax revolt that helped elect Ronald Reagan president in 1980. \u201cWhat people used to take for granted they can no longer take for granted \u2013 on your ability to pay your rent, your ability to walk the streets safely, on your ability not to be accosted by a homeless person,\u201d says Yaroslavsky, now director of the Los Angeles Initiative at the Luskin School of Public Affairs at the University of California Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s a lack of confidence in government\u2019s ability to respond.\u201d Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez, who took office in 2013, feels those gusts too. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a more angrier electorate than this particular election,\u201d she told me. \u201cI think all of this is just at a boiling point.\u201d The dominant role of crime and homelessness in the Los Angeles and San Francisco elections represents an inversion of the political agenda since the summer of 2020. Like dozens of other cities, both places saw protesters for police reform fill the streets following George Floyd\u2019s murder. In Los Angeles, that energy helped propel Gascon to a narrow victory over the law enforcement-backed District Attorney Jackie Lacey in November 2020 and also powered voter approval of a ballot initiative to combat racial inequities by shifting county funds toward social services and alternatives to incarceration. Boudin, the San Francisco district attorney, who was narrowly elected in 2019, and Gascon have pursued largely parallel agendas centered on reducing incarceration through measures such as a virtual prohibition on trying juveniles as adults, the rejection of \u201cenhancements\u201d (for such factors as gang involvement or use of a gun) that extend sentence lengths and a policy of not prosecuting \u201cquality of life\u201d misdemeanors associated with homelessness, such as trespassing and public urination. That agenda quickly faced fierce resistance from other elements in the criminal justice system committed to traditional approaches, including the unions representing police in both cities. Law enforcement interests are backing the recalls against Gascon and Boudin, and in LA the police union is spending heavily against Bass, a leader in the House of Representatives\u2019 passage last year of sweeping federal police reform legislation. The recall efforts against Boudin and Gascon, as well as Caruso\u2019s mayoral bid in Los Angeles, have also drawn support from big Republican donors, who constitute a distinct minority in both cities. The role of both law enforcement insiders and conservative donors and activists has frustrated advocates for police reform, who see the backlash across these many fronts as an attempt to restore hardline approaches before new alternatives are given a chance to demonstrate whether they can succeed. Take a look at our streets: No matter where you live now, you can walk down the street, you can look out your front window, and you will see \u2026 that what the city and the county have been doing simply is not working. Nury Martinez, Los Angeles City Council president \u201cI think to a very large degree that more conservative forces have been very, very adept at framing the issues of homelessness and of crime so that the discussion about \u2026 how to respond to those two issues is very, very narrow,\u201d says Los Angeles City Council Member Mike Bonin, an outspoken liberal who is not seeking reelection this year after narrowly avoiding a recall drive centered on his resistance to tougher measures against the  endemic homelessness across his Westside district. Yet the evidence is overwhelming that the unease dominating Tuesday\u2019s elections extends far beyond conservative circles. Yaroslavsky points out that in the UCLA Luskin School\u2019s annual polling across Los Angeles County, concern about crime has increased substantially not only among Whites, but among Hispanics, Blacks and Asian Americans as well. Ben LaBolt, a San Francisco-based Democratic strategist and former campaign spokesperson for Barack Obama, likewise notes that prominent local Democrats have played leading roles in the effort to recall Boudin. \u201cThe notion that this [recall] is some right-wing misinformation campaign is dangerous for Democrats to say or think, because it\u2019s definitely not,\u201d he says. In both cities, anxiety about public safety is rising faster than the actual trends in reported crime. The online dashboard maintained by the San Francisco Police Department shows that through May 29 (the latest week for which figures are available) burglaries and break-ins or thefts of motor vehicles are clearly up from the comparable period in 2019, before Boudin took office. But assaults and homicides are virtually unchanged over that period, and robberies are down, as are the total number of serious offenses. In Los Angeles the trends are more consistently troublesome: The Los Angeles Police Department\u2019s tracking system shows that through late May both property crimes and violent crimes had increased substantially over the comparable period in 2020 (before Gascon\u2019s election). But even in LA, both violent and property crimes remain a small fraction of their elevated levels in the 1990s and well below their rates for most of this century\u2019s first decade. \u201cWe are not seeing numbers that look anything like some of the worst eras that people have been through,\u201d says Michelle Parris, California program director at the Vera Institute of Justice, speaking on behalf of Vera Action, a criminal justice advocacy group. Moreover, she points out, California communities with tough-on-crime policies like Sacramento and rural Kern County are experiencing crime upticks that in some cases exceed the increases in Los Angeles and San Francisco. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that even tough-on-crime prosecutors in California have not delivered safety,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are subject to the same exact trends we are seeing around the country.\u201d Like many other observers in both cities, Parris points to a different cause than crime per se as the primary driver of rising anxiety over public safety. \u201cHomelessness and untreated mental illness \u2026 impacts people\u2019s perception of safety,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd so I think that\u2019s part of why in places like Los Angeles or San Francisco in particular, where [that] is quite visible, that has a great impact of what people are talking about.\u201d In both cities, pervasive homelessness has rekindled the concern about losing control of city streets that inspired advocates of the \u201cbroken windows\u201d theory to argue 40 years ago for greater enforcement against crimes of \u201cdisorder\u201d like loitering, panhandling and public intoxication. In San Francisco, concern has centered on the Tenderloin neighborhood, which has been overwhelmed with open drug use among the homeless. In Los Angeles, the mayoral and City Council races have been dominated by concerns about the spread of large homeless encampments across the city. These encampments have proliferated despite the approval of two ballot initiatives in Los Angeles in 2016 authorizing substantial expenditures to build housing and provide services for the homeless \u2013 and the City Council\u2019s passage of an ordinance last fall authorizing the removal of encampments around sensitive areas such as schools, libraries and day care centers. \u201cTake a look at our streets: No matter where you live now, you can walk down the street, you can look out your front window, and you will see \u2026 that what the city and the county have been doing simply is not working,\u201d says Martinez, the LA City Council president. Yaroslavsky, the former city and county official, says the persistence of the homeless encampments has become a viscerally visible symbol of fundamental governmental failure. \u201cI think homelessness is both a real issue but it\u2019s also a metaphor for everything else that\u2019s gone wrong in society and government\u2019s ability to address something that is so visible and so ubiquitous in the county,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it\u2019s like a billboard that says failure.\u201d My last email to the mayor\u2019s office was that, amongst other things, we just had a massacre in Texas, an unstable man who was ignored, but it\u2019s not like people didn\u2019t know he was unstable. We have a park of mentally unstable people currently slashing and shooting each other. What would make us think this wouldn\u2019t turn into something much more tragic? Elizabeth Clay, activist and land use planner The neighborhood uproar over a large encampment around the public library in the traditionally liberal oceanfront LA community of Venice encapsulates the discontent that has upended politics in both cities. After the city of Los Angeles finally cleared out a massive homeless encampment along the Venice boardwalk that attracted national attention, a new one developed last fall around the community\u2019s public library. It has now engulfed the library on all sides, angering and frightening nearby residents, who have posted viral videos of rampant drug use and violence in the area. Longtime library patrons have publicly lamented that they no longer feel safe using the facility, which was also threatened by a recent fire that started in the camp. \u201cThere\u2019s slashings. There\u2019s shootings,\u201d says Elizabeth Clay, a local activist and land use planner who has been involved in community protests against the encampment. \u201cMy last email to the mayor\u2019s office was that, amongst other things, we just had a massacre in Texas, an unstable man who was ignored, but it\u2019s not like people didn\u2019t know he was unstable. We have a park of mentally unstable people currently slashing and shooting each other. What would make us think this wouldn\u2019t turn into something much more tragic?\u201d To frustrated residents, the effective surrender of the library \u2013 the quintessential public service \u2013 to a homeless encampment amounts to a perverse elevation of the interests of those who don\u2019t pay taxes over those residents who do. Many, like Clay, express deep disappointment with outgoing Mayor Eric Garcetti, who they view as disengaged from his job and the mounting crisis on the streets as he tries to win approval for his nomination as ambassador to India. But the principal focus of residents\u2019 ire is Bonin, the liberal council member who was one of two to oppose the ordinance barring camping around sensitive facilities. The city\u2019s anti-camping ordinance requires that the council vote to approve each individual enforcement action, and Clay and others say that Bonin has repeatedly blocked plans for such efforts around the library. In the interview, Bonin denied blocking cleanup plans (except for once, he said, when he asked the city to hold off while he tried to assemble a broader interagency response that never materialized). But he was adamant in insisting that simply dismantling the tent city in the park would only compound the problem unless it was accompanied by permanent housing and services for the homeless now living there. \u201cIf there is a massive enforcement without offering services \u2026 what that\u2019s going to do is just move people across the street in front of people\u2019s homes and deeper into residential neighborhoods,\u201d he argues. There is still substantial support in Los Angeles for providing services to homeless people. Even Caruso, who has promised to build much more housing and provide more services to the homeless, sounds very different from Giuliani and other early hardline advocates of the broken windows theory, whose policies were often derided as unfairly increasing police enforcement against young minority men. No mainstream voice in either city is suggesting that policymakers can simply arrest their way out of the homeless crisis or even the uptick in crime. But all sides in the debate agree the public appears out of patience, both in San Francisco and Los Angeles, with a set of policies that has surrendered control of public spaces and made it difficult for residents to get through the day without encountering people who appear to be a danger to themselves or others. The same ebbing of patience is visible in the often-expressed belief that Boudin and Gascon, by placing so much priority on reducing incarceration, have encouraged a sense of invulnerability among repeat criminal offenders. \u201cThe voters are conflicted: Karen Bass, Mike Bonin, all these guys, they reflect our values,\u201d says Guerra, the political scientist. \u201cBut that\u2019s not where we are right now. The moment is about homelessness, public safety, and they are not even speaking to that.\u201d Caruso has declared that if elected he will declare emergency powers as mayor that authorize him to clear homeless encampments without approval from the City Council. Bass hasn\u2019t gone that far, but she\u2019s also pledged to end encampments. \u201cThere are some things you just don\u2019t do outside, and sleeping is one of them,\u201d Bass has repeatedly said. Whoever wins the LA mayoral race, \u201cthe tide is turning, and now I feel that in each district you have an avalanche of people who are just outright pissed off at the state of affairs in our city,\u201d says Martinez, the City Council president. \u201cI believe that is what is moving the council to take a harder stance on allowing encampments to remain.\u201d The same trajectory is evident on policing. While activists had hoped to significantly redirect funding away from the LAPD \u2013 an institution with a long history of racial bias \u2013 in the aftermath of the Floyd murder, Caruso is now promising to add 1,500 officers. Even Bass, while not abandoning her calls for reform and accountability, wants to maintain the department\u2019s current staffing level and move more officers out from desk jobs to augment its presence on the streets. It\u2019s still an open question how far this public demand for order will extend. Boudin\u2019s recall seems almost inevitable, and it will likely reinforce the message of the recent recalls of three very liberal members of the city\u2019s Board of Education: that local residents want their government to focus less on absolutist ideological statements than on delivering basic services. LaBolt predicts that after Boudin, San Francisco won\u2019t see a lurch to the right on law enforcement but rather a recalibration toward the center: \u201cI think what we\u2019ll see is a return to the assertion that you don\u2019t have to choose between public safety and criminal justice reform.\u201d The landscape in LA is complex too. Polls show widespread discontent with Gascon\u2019s performance, and the campaign against him claims it is well on its way toward obtaining the signatures it needs by early July to qualify a recall against him on the November ballot. But it is not unusual in California for such efforts to fail after large number of signatures are disqualified. Meanwhile, the county\u2019s hardline and scandal-tarred sheriff, Alex Villanueva, who has denounced liberal policies on crime and homelessness, will likely face a runoff after Tuesday with a challenger to his left. Tuesday\u2019s City Council primaries could see strong showings for hardline law-and-order candidates \u2013 in particular in Bonin\u2019s district, where discontent is peaking \u2013 but in several other districts, left-leaning candidates deeply critical of the LAPD and the anti-encampment laws are mounting serious challenges to more centrist incumbents. Even the mayoral race shows conflicting currents. The fact that Caruso, a former Republican, is demonstrating so much strength is revealing in itself (even if he\u2019s been buoyed by his massive personal spending). But Caruso has endorsed conventionally liberal positions on almost all issues beyond crime and homelessness, and most analysts expect that he and Bass will meet in a November runoff because neither will attract the 50% of the vote needed to win outright on Tuesday. Caruso\u2019s promises to restore order \u201ccan have great appeal \u2026 in a time that is unsettled and you have $30 million to spend,\u201d says Manuel Pastor, director of the Dornsife Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California. \u201cThe question is whether or not there\u2019s a cap to that [support] similar to the top that there was to the recall campaign\u201d against California Gov. Gavin Newsom in 2021, which qualified for the ballot but then failed last fall. Yet even if Bass ultimately squeezes past Caruso, Gascon narrowly avoids a recall or San Francisco doesn\u2019t swing hard to the right on law enforcement if Boudin is recalled, the evidence suggests Democrats would be wrong to minimize the magnitude of the tremors building in California. In both Los Angeles and San Francisco, it\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that the most progressive forces have opened the door to a right-tilting backlash by failing to adequately respond to, or even acknowledge, the depth of public discontent over the mounting disorder \u2013 even among many voters who lean left in their values. More than even the specific issues of crime and homelessness, \u201cwhat\u2019s feeding the beast\u201d of backlash \u201cis just the general sense of disarray and dysfunction that is permeating everything,\u201d says veteran Democratic pollster Paul Maslin, who is advising an independent expenditure campaign supporting Bass. The parallel to national politics is the potential for a seismic backlash in November among voters unsettled by all the disruptions to daily life \u2013 from inflation to Covid-19 to crime \u2013 that have persisted through Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. That continued turbulence has undermined the implicit promise of his candidacy: to return the nation to something approaching normalcy after all the turmoil of the Donald Trump presidency. In all likelihood, the results in Los Angeles and San Francisco on Tuesday will underscore how far voters feel from normalcy even in two of the nation\u2019s most staunchly Democratic communities.",

            "article_content": "Momentous and tragic events are driving public attention back toward abortion rights and gun control, two issues that keyed the Democratic advance in well-educated suburbs over the past generation. And that could create the Democrats\u2019 best chance of defending those gains in the stormy environment of the 2022 midterm elections. Debates over abortion and guns have played a central role in the ongoing geographic resorting of the two predominant political parties. Since the early years of this century, Republicans have consolidated a commanding grip on rural and small-town communities filled with culturally conservative blue-collar voters who generally oppose both legal abortion and most restrictions on gun ownership. In mirror image, Democrats have gained in white-collar communities around major cities filled with well-educated voters who generally support both abortion rights and gun control \u2013 a process that peaked with the sweeping suburban gains that powered the party\u2019s recapture of the US House in 2018. Amid discontent over persistent Covid disruptions, dissatisfaction over President Joe Biden\u2019s performance, supply chain problems like the shortage of infant formula, and above all, the highest inflation in 40 years, Republicans have expressed mounting confidence about recapturing many of those suburban House seats, and flipping suburban voters in Senate and governor races, in November. But the tragic mass shootings in Buffalo, New York, and Uvalde, Texas, have riveted attention on gun violence and access to firearms, even as the leaking of a draft opinion from five GOP-appointed justices has raised the prospect that the Supreme Court, just weeks from now, might repeal the constitutional right to abortion established under the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. No serious analyst in either party expects more focus on these issues to erase all the advantages Republicans are stockpiling in the midterm elections. But the more those issues influence voters\u2019 decisions, operatives on both sides of the debate agree, the better Democrats\u2019 chances to blunt the GOP advance, at least in white-collar and suburban communities. \u201cRefocusing on gun safety and abortion rights will move many of these 2018 suburban districts away from the Republicans and make their playing field smaller,\u201d predicts Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords, the gun safety advocacy group founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords. Many Republicans agree they could face more resistance in suburbia if abortion rights and gun control remain prominent concerns through Election Day. John Thomas, a Texas-based GOP consultant who has worked extensively in California suburbs such as Orange County, says that until these issues resurfaced so prominently, the Republican path in these areas appeared clear, with voters less focused on their distaste for former President Donald Trump and more on their dissatisfaction with Biden. \u201cTwo months ago, we would have absolutely waltzed through these places with college-educated suburban White women, because they had no real reason to either break against us or turn out,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no orange man [Trump] \u2013 there was no wedge issue for them.\u201d Like most Republicans, and even some Democrats, Thomas believes that discontent over inflation and disenchantment over Biden will remain the driving factor in white-collar districts, just as in less affluent places. But, he says, the renewed attention to abortion and gun control has added an element of uncertainty and created an opening for Democrats to change the electoral dynamic in some areas. \u201cIt comes down to what is the national conversation and top issue as we go to November,\u201d Thomas says. \u201cIs it economic driven and a referendum on Biden\u2019s failure? Quite frankly, if those other issues [gun control and abortion] are in the world of parity, Republicans have problems in those seats.\u201d Improved performance in well-educated suburbs (along with society\u2019s increasing racial diversity and the growth of millennials and Generation Z in the electorate) has been among the most significant drivers of Democratic electoral gains over the past quarter century. The Democrats\u2019 suburban advance has reflected the increasing prominence of cultural affinities in shaping electoral choices, with the party gaining among voters who often took center-right positions on economic issues like taxes but leaned left on cultural questions such as abortion, gun control and LGBTQ rights. (That process, in reverse, fueled the GOP small-town and rural gains among culturally conservative voters who once backed Democrats supporting expansive government programs such as Social Security.) Through the 1990s, House Republicans representing suburban constituencies often voted for gun control and/or expressed support for legalized abortion: When the House in 1993 passed the \u201cBrady Bill\u201d establishing the national background check system for purchases from gun stores, 54 House Republicans, mostly representing suburban areas, voted for it. But since then, almost all elected Republicans, whatever their constituencies, have moved toward lockstep opposition to legal abortion and gun control. Against the backdrop of widespread white-collar discontent with Trump, Democrats exploited that mismatch more effectively than ever in 2018, when they ousted Republicans from suburban districts around major cities from coast to coast. In that election, Republicans tumbled from holding about 43% of all the House districts with more college graduates than average to only about 25% of them, according to a CNN analysis at the time. The Giffords group calculated that 40 House Republicans with high ratings from the National Rifle Association lost or retired that year. Two years later, those same suburban places provided decisive votes for Biden. But these suburban areas haven\u2019t been immune to the general discontent over the country\u2019s direction and Biden\u2019s performance that has generated such a powerful tailwind for Republicans in the 2022 elections. Biden\u2019s approval with college-educated White voters remains much higher than his standing among Whites without such degrees. But compared with his 2020 vote he has fallen substantially with well-educated voters as well, especially men. As the salience of gun violence grows with these mass shootings, and the salience of abortion rights grow with the upcoming Supreme Court decision, you are going to see these swing suburban voters enrage themselves all over again over the common cause the Republican Party has made with the extreme right wing of the conservative movement. Peter Ambler, executive director of Giffords Amid that discontent, Republicans have been extremely optimistic about regaining ground with suburban voters in the critical statewide races for governor (including in Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Texas, Arizona and Nevada) and the Senate (including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.) \u201cThese areas had been moving more Democrat,\u201d says former National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Davis, who represented a suburban Northern Virginia seat in the US House. \u201cWhat you see now are the Democrats in charge, and to the average person the economy is not being managed [well], and so I think it\u2019s going to snap back to some extent.\u201d Because suburban seats fueled the Democratic takeover of the House, they are especially central to Republican hopes of winning back the chamber. In 2020, Republicans recaptured many of the Democratic 2018 pickups in districts where Trump remained popular. That\u2019s left Democrats mostly defending seats this fall in metropolitan areas that didn\u2019t like Trump but have now soured on Biden \u2013 a list that includes the districts held by Reps. Elaine Luria and Abigail Spanberger in Virginia, Elissa Slotkin in Michigan, Angie Craig in Minnesota, Cindy Axne in Iowa, Greg Stanton in Arizona, Susie Lee in Nevada, Kim Schrier in Washington state, and Mike Levin and Katie Porter in California. The suburbs are \u201cwhere we are either going to stem losses or hold our ground,\u201d says Democratic pollster Molly Murphy. Attitudes about guns and abortion may represent Democrats\u2019 best chance in these places. Public polling shows that large majorities of college-educated voters side with Democratic views on both issues. Nearly 70% of college-educated adults, for instance, said they opposed overturning Roe v. Wade in a nationwide CNN poll conducted by SSRS in May. Among college-educated adults, nearly 9 in 10 supported universal background checks for gun purchases, and more than 7 in 10 backed a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines in a nationwide Pew Research Center poll last year, according to detailed results provided to CNN by Pew. Nearly 9 in 10 college graduates also opposed a policy proliferating in Republican-controlled states: allowing people to carry concealed weapons without permits in public places. State polls underline that message. In California, a state with multiple competitive US House races, 69% of college-educated adults said they were more likely to vote for a candidate who supported maintaining Roe, compared with just 12% who said they wanted a candidate committed to overturning it, according to a recent Public Policy Institute of California survey. Even in Texas, University of Texas/Texas Tribune polls have found that nearly 6 in 10 residents with college degrees oppose both the complete ban on abortion that will snap into effect there this summer if the Supreme Court overturns Roe and the 2021 state law allowing permitless carry of firearms. Given such lopsided attitudes among well-educated voters, activists and Democratic operatives believe the sharp contrasts between the parties on guns and abortion could shift the electoral dynamic in suburban battlefields up and down the ballot. \u201cThis renewed focus on gun safety undermines the Republican case in those more educated, affluent, diverse suburban districts that have been at the core of the Democrats\u2019 new majority,\u201d says Ambler of Giffords. \u201cAs the salience of gun violence grows with these mass shootings, and the salience of abortion rights grow with the upcoming Supreme Court decision, you are going to see these swing suburban voters enrage themselves all over again over the common cause the Republican Party has made with the extreme right wing of the conservative movement.\u201d Abortion rights advocates believe a high court decision in the next few weeks overturning Roe would transform the political debate by eliminating what Christina Reynolds, vice president for communications at Emily\u2019s List, a group supporting Democratic female candidates who favor abortion rights, calls the \u201cbelievability gap\u201d: the skepticism among voters who back abortion rights that the right to abortion, in place for so long, really could be rescinded. \u201cFundamentally people believe you should have the freedom to make your own decisions,\u201d she says. I do feel pretty confident that the economy, housing, inflation, gas, food shortages are going to be there, and \u2026 if that kind of stuff is driving the media conversation, then Democrats are going to get wiped. John Thomas, a Texas-based GOP consultant Shannon Olivieri Hovis, the director of NARAL Pro-Choice California, says the group\u2019s polling and focus groups have found widespread awareness \u2013 and astonishment \u2013 that Roe could be reversed. \u201cCertainly the leak of the draft majority opinion was an eye-opening reality for a lot of folks,\u201d she says. Most people alive, she adds, \u201cno matter how old they are,\u201d have lived in a nation where abortion has been legal \u201cfor the vast majority of their lives.\u201d Now that could change, within weeks given how many states are poised to ban abortion immediately if the Supreme Court allows it. \u201cPeople do not like having their rights taken away. It\u2019s completely an astonishing idea [to them] that something that is so established could be reversed,\u201d she says. Democrats and advocacy groups don\u2019t expect that more attention to abortion rights and gun control will cause Republican women who agree with them on the issues to abandon GOP candidates. But they do think the renewed prominence of these controversies could tip some independent women dissatisfied with Biden and inflation. Even more important, they believe these questions could increase turnout among key groups in their coalition that might otherwise be less motivated to vote in a midterm, particularly college-educated, single and younger women. Chris Taylor, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, says the contrasts between the parties on guns and abortion could energize Democratic-leaning voters who turned out in huge numbers to oppose Trump but may feel less urgency now. Gun control will \u201cbe front and center, and the same thing on abortion: It all falls under the same banner of you may not agree with us on everything but these guys are way too extreme for you to vote for them,\u201d he says. Thomas, the Republican consultant, agrees that in many white-collar areas it will be difficult for Republican candidates to win a debate centered on views about those two polarizing issues. And he agrees the increased attention to both concerns will likely rejuvenate Democrats\u2019 small-donor fundraising, strengthening their capacity to defend more seats. But he remains optimistic that even in suburban districts, the campaign debate won\u2019t lastingly shift toward guns and abortion. \u201cI do feel pretty confident that the economy, housing, inflation, gas, food shortages are going to be there, and \u2026 if that kind of stuff is driving the media conversation, then Democrats are going to get wiped,\u201d he predicts. Republican pollster Gene Ulm is even more emphatic. \u201cThese issues, all of them, are just being crushed by economic concerns, and that will continue,\u201d he says. While guns and abortion could generate \u201can incremental turnout effect that could affect suburbia in certain states,\u201d he adds, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about an incremental change when there\u2019s huge sea changes going on,\u201d with voters across the income and educational spectrum moving toward the GOP amid discontent over inflation and Biden. It\u2019s not only the overriding public concern about inflation and the economy; the extent of electoral re-sorting that has already occurred also could dilute the impact of these issues this fall, Davis argues. Most voters, he notes, who disagree with either party on abortion and guns have already migrated toward the other \u2013 meaning a renewed focus on those issues isn\u2019t likely to shift many more voters now. \u201cI think it helps the Democratic base, which was starting to crater, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the game changer it might have been 20 years ago,\u201d Davis says. Although the horrific Buffalo and Uvalde massacres, and the pending Supreme Court decision on Roe, could shift the public\u2019s focus, polls make clear that Democrats still have work to do in persuading voters to focus more on these issues this year. In the recent Public Policy Institute of California poll, for example, just 2% of California voters picked abortion as their top concern, compared with 24% who identified jobs, the economy or inflation. In the May CNN survey, half of the minority of adults who wanted to overturn Roe said they were extremely or very enthusiastic about voting in November, compared with less than two-fifths of those who opposed reversing the decision. Why Washington can't have an honest debate about inflation Murphy says that ultimately both parties must compete on both fronts: Democrats need to respond to voter concerns about the economy and Republicans have to defend their differences with suburban voters on abortion and guns. \u201cI think it\u2019s not so binary, because I do think these races are going to include a mix,\u201d Murphy says. \u201cRepublicans will have to debate these issues and Democrats will have to show their economic strength.\u201d Most analysts in both parties agree that so many voters are expressing unhappiness over the country\u2019s direction that Republicans are likely to post significant gains in November no matter how much attention shifts from the economy to abortion rights and gun control. The real issue isn\u2019t whether Democrats can reverse that wave, it\u2019s whether they can blunt it by holding on to some of the white-collar suburban voters who looked ready to move back toward the GOP after stampeding away from the party under Trump. In that way, abortion and gun control could affect this election the same way the battle over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh did in 2018, predicts David Wasserman, who studies House races for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter. The incendiary Kavanaugh struggle only a few weeks before Election Day, he notes, did not stop big Democratic gains in 2018 but it did narrow the enthusiasm gap between Democratic and Republican voters and prevent an even worse shellacking for the GOP. \u201cThere was a big enthusiasm gap until Kavanaugh, and Kavanaugh helped Republicans win net two Senate seats and probably cut their House losses from being worse,\u201d Wasserman says. While Democrats have little chance of holding the House, he adds, \u201cI can see a scenario where, close to the election, Democrats\u2019 voters tune in because everything is existential in this era and [the Democratic losses] are not as bad as forecast.\u201d In this blustery electoral environment, that may be about the most Democrats can hope for.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s been a record-setting year for the Republican Party, which is fielding 81 Black candidates in the 2022 primaries, according to the National Republican Congressional Committee. Already, the outcomes have varied widely. Herschel Walker, whom Republicans have rallied behind, has won Tuesday\u2019s primary for US Senate in Georgia, CNN projects. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell called Walker the \u201creal deal\u201d last fall, per Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who had been lobbying McConnell to support Walker, a football legend with the backing of former President Donald Trump. Kathy Barnette lost her US Senate bid in Pennsylvania earlier this month, while Wesley Hunt dominated his primary for a US House seat in Texas in March. The uptick in Black Republican candidates, who range from committed conservatives to opportunists just eager to be elected to office, prompts questions about the allure of a party that has long been hostile to Black Americans. Before the United States\u2019 two main political parties realigned over the course of the 20th century, it was the Republican Party, founded by abolitionists in 1854, that championed the rights of Black Americans. By around the mid-1900s, however, one thing was clear: The GOP was the \u201cparty of Lincoln\u201d in name only. In his 1949 study of party realignment, the political scientist V.O. Key Jr. offered an unsparing critique of the GOP, especially the GOP in the South, saying that \u201cit scarcely deserves the name of party\u201d and that \u201cit wavers somewhat between an esoteric cult\u201d and \u201ca conspiracy for plunder.\u201d George W. Lee, a Black civil rights leader and Republican, also sounded the alarm about his party\u2019s troubling turn on race relations, writing in 1962 that the GOP seemed to be on the brink of being \u201ctaken over lock, stock and barrel by the Ku Kluxers, the John Birchers and other extreme right-wing reactionaries.\u201d It\u2019s fair to say that Lee was right to worry, in light of the actions of a number of members of today\u2019s Republican Party. Note, for instance, how key GOP figures have embraced a sanitized but no less dangerous version of the so-called great replacement theory, the racist and false belief that there\u2019s a scheme to eradicate White Americans. Still, there are Black Republicans who insist that there\u2019s a place for them in the GOP. Take Hunt, who advanced from his primary in March and is expected to win the US House race this fall for Texas\u2019 largely White 38th Congressional District, which is part of a new map designed to preserve GOP power in the state. \u201cDiversity in the Republican Party is not the best,\u201d Hunt recently told The New York Times. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have people like me, and women, step up and say, actually, it\u2019s OK to be a person of color and to be a Republican, then we\u2019re going to lose the next generation.\u201d How to make sense of Hunt and Walker \u2013 of the relationship between the GOP and its Black members? I spoke with Theodore R. Johnson, who\u2019s the director of the Fellows Program at the Brennan Center for Justice and whose work interrogates the role that race plays in electoral politics. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. The Democratic Party might take Black Americans for granted outside election years, but the GOP is actively hostile to Black Americans. What, then, is the appeal of the GOP \u2013 the party of arch-segregationist Strom Thurmond \u2013 to Black candidates, according to your research? I think that a smaller percentage of the current crop of Black congressional candidates running under the Republican Party, some of them are just Republicans. And that might be because of national security or they may be anti-abortion or they may have some idea about small government or tax rates. But I think that the vast majority are essentially opportunists. They see a chance to get ahead very quickly in this version of the party. One, because minorities are underrepresented in the party, and there\u2019s a pathway for them. And two, because this version of the party doesn\u2019t really require you to hold conservative principles in order to have an opportunity to win elections. As long as you\u2019re willing to show some partisan loyalty \u2013 and, right now, that means stuff around election fraud and MAGA \u2013 then there\u2019s a quicker pathway to elected office than there\u2019d be if these folks were either principled conservatives with no name recognition or trying to reach office as a Democrat. That line is much longer and the competition much stiffer. You recently wrote about the relationship between Black Republicans and movements such as the tea party movement \u2013 how Black Republicans become both \u201can acceptable avatar\u201d for the GOP and \u201can aegis against accusations of racial intolerance within the movement itself.\u201d Could you explain this dynamic a bit more? Every time a wave of Black Republicans has entered Congress in the nation\u2019s history, it\u2019s been when the Republican Party has been captured by a movement. For instance, the first movement was Lincoln and the abolition of slavery and the Civil War. Another movement was the tea party movement, when you got people including Allen West and Will Hurd and Mia Love and Tim Scott. In the piece, I argue that the tea party movement allowed Black Republicans to make themselves attractive to a predominantly White base, a significant part of which holds high levels of racial resentment. The base was willing to mute its racial resentment to choose the candidate it thought was committed to the movement. What political scientists and sociologists have found is that the characteristics that would typically make a candidate unattractive to a particular base can be muted when that candidate shows a commitment to the movement that has captured the party. A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting power So, if you\u2019re Tim Scott or one of the new Black Republicans in Congress and show that you\u2019re more committed to MAGA than your primary opponents are, then whatever negatives your race may have gotten you in the Republican primary are basically nullified by your commitment to the movement, whether it\u2019s the tea party movement or MAGA. This time around, I think that we might get six Black Republicans in Congress. But not because the party is doing a better job with Black voters. It\u2019s still doing terribly. The party is getting more Black candidates because it\u2019s easier for those candidates to show their Republican-ness when there\u2019s a movement afoot than when it\u2019s just about tax rates or national security. I want to ask my next question carefully. In some ways, it seems like Black Republicans might help the GOP shift more to the right, by giving cover to some of the movements that have captured it. What do you make of that sentiment? Absolutely. When the tea party came on the scene, its proponents were saying, \u201cThis has nothing to do with Barack Obama\u2019s race. This is all about the size of the national debt.\u201d But when social scientists started digging into it, they found that those folks held higher levels of racial resentment and that it wasn\u2019t an accident that the movement came about at the same time that the birtherism stuff was around. And then, of course, MAGA comes on the scene, with Donald Trump talking about Mexican rapists and Baltimore being rat-infested. So, no matter what proponents say the movement is about, there\u2019s a heavy racial dimension with the language. When you have minority candidates and people are saying that your movement is racist, you point to Winsome Sears and say, \u201cWe just elected a Black lieutenant governor in Virginia.\u201d You point to Tim Scott and say, \u201cThis guy is handily winning reelection in South Carolina.\u201d You point to Burgess Owens in Utah and Byron Donalds in Florida and say, \u201cHow can a party be racist when it\u2019s increasing the number of racial and ethnic minority representatives at the state and federal levels?\u201d But what all the research suggests is that these are considered exceptional minorities. And so people can hold racist views of a group and still support members of that group for office because the members they support are unlike the group they don\u2019t like. These are the exceptions. So, yes, there is a kind of masking element to supporting racial and ethnic minority candidates when the movement that helped those candidates reach power has a deep connection to high levels of racial resentment. Why do so many of today\u2019s Black Republicans appear to be different from yesterday\u2019s Black Republicans, from someone such as former Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts, who seemed to want to fit Black needs into the party rather than just broadcast the party\u2019s positions? I think that it\u2019s because the Republicans of today don\u2019t resemble the ones of four or five decades ago. If you\u2019re a Black Republican and Ronald Reagan is your hero, there\u2019s probably not a lot of room for you in this version of the party. And so the Black Republicans are just Republicans. As the party\u2019s persona changes, the candidates who are able to rise in a changed party also begin to change. What we\u2019ve seen since the election of Barack Obama is that those Black conservatives who might\u2019ve voted Republican in, say, the 1980s and \u201990s, maybe even in the early 2000s, they\u2019ve left the party or sit out elections. And some of them never went back to the party because the party then had Trump. That\u2019s a different party. In short, Black Republicans are leaving, and the ones left behind are the ones who most reflect the current version of the party. And there aren\u2019t lots of Black MAGA folks out there, even though there are tons of Black conservatives. I think that that\u2019s the major explanation. A second explanation I get from Leah Wright Rigueur, who wrote \u201cThe Loneliness of the Black Republican.\u201d She said that, generally, there are a few different kinds of Black Republicans when you look back at the last century or so. There are those folks today whose grandparents or great-grandparents were Republicans, and they\u2019ve just never left. The party has changed, but they\u2019ve just stuck around. Then there are those who believe that there needs to be someone Black at the Republican table. The thinking is: If there are no Black Republicans around, who\u2019s looking out for HBCUs? Who\u2019s trying to make sure that the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act don\u2019t get rolled back? They see themselves as being there to hold the line and make sure that there\u2019s some representation. And then there are just opportunists. They\u2019re just grifters. Maybe they wanted to run for office and went to the Democratic Party in their area and were told, \u201cGet in line.\u201d Then they went to the Republican Party and were told, \u201cGreat. We\u2019d love to have you. When can you get started so that we can figure out how this campaign will work?\u201d If you\u2019re intent on serving in elected office and get those two responses, you\u2019re more likely to go with the party that says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d There\u2019s also a distorted version of this. Some of these folks who are running for Congress might see a moment and say, \u201cIf I can just be an exaggerated version of what this movement loves, I might have a shot here.\u201d And it\u2019s not because they\u2019re committed to those principles, necessarily. It\u2019s because they\u2019re committed to trying to win office.",

            "article_content": "Georgia Republicans have nominated former football star Herschel Walker to take on Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, CNN projects, in what\u2019s expected to be one of the most important US Senate races of the 2022 midterm elections. Walker, 60, who was urged to run by former President Donald Trump, is a political newcomer \u2013 but a celebrity in the state where he won the 1982 Heisman trophy as one of college football\u2019s greatest running backs of all time at the University of Georgia. His Senate run opened the candidate to scrutiny of his personal life, including the resurfacing of allegations of domestic violence and threats against former romantic partners. Still, Walker breezed through the primary, skipping debates and forums that would have forced him to take clear policy positions and answer tough questions. His main competitor was Gary Black, the state\u2019s longtime agriculture commissioner, but Black did not raise enough money to run a serious television advertising campaign that could have exploited Walker\u2019s vulnerabilities. How Herschel Walker united the right and has Democrats plotting for a fight The general election contest is likely to touchon race. Warnock is Georgia\u2019s first Black senator, and Walker would be the second. Warnock preaches at Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s former church, Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and has a long record as a civil rights champion. Walker, meanwhile, has long expressed ambivalence about racial issues. Democrats won control of the US Senate last year, after Warnock and Jon Ossoff both won runoff elections in Georgia. But Democrats\u2019 hold on the Senate is by the narrowest of margins \u2013 with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote in the 50-50 chamber \u2013 and the party cannot afford a net loss of a single seat in the 2022 midterms. Walker has had a long relationship with Trump, dating to 1984, when the former President \u2013 then the owner of the United States Football League\u2019s New Jersey Generals \u2013 gave Walker a contract extension. Walker later appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Celebrity Apprentice\u201d with Trump and encouraged his 2016 and 2020 presidential bids.",

            "article_content": "When Stacey Abrams acknowledged defeat to Republican Brian Kemp in her 2018 campaign for governor of Georgia, she refused to call it a \u201cconcession.\u201d Four years later, the man she once described as an \u201carchitect of voter suppression\u201d is the incumbent \u2013 and the state she came so close to leading has enacted some of the nation\u2019s most restrictive voting laws. Abrams is running unopposed in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial primary, which means her general election campaign really began in December 2021, when she announced plans to run against Kemp, who\u2019s facing a Donald Trump-backed primary threat. But Abrams\u2019 status has changed since her name was last on the ballot. An underdog with little following outside of Georgia four years ago, the former state House minority leader is now one of the most popular Democrats in the country \u2013 a political star some in the party wanted to run for president and a key figure in helping turn the state blue for Joe Biden in 2020 and electing Democratic Sens. Raphael Warnock, who is on the ballot again this year, and Jon Ossoff in subsequent runoffs. With strong lead over Perdue, Kemp shifts attention to Abrams in Georgia governor's race Abrams\u2019 rise to national prominence has also triggered a backlash from Republicans. Her efforts to increase access to the ballot and turnout in communities traditionally ignored by candidates from both parties has run up against Trump-inspired Republican efforts to make voting more difficult, with Georgia at the front of that line. Abrams must also contend with a harsher political atmosphere: the Democratic wave of 2018 has crested and the 2022 midterms are expected to be much kinder to Republicans, who are now riding a swell of discontent over Biden and Democratic rule on Capitol Hill. Though the circumstances around her have changed, Abrams says this campaign\u2019s mission looks a lot like the old one\u2019s \u2013 to drive turnout among new and occasional voters, while hammering Kemp and Republicans over issues like health care and education. \u201cWe have to reach every single voter, in every way we can. We had record turnout and we saw a composition of voters the state had never seen before,\u201d Abrams told CNN. \u201cMy mission in \u201922 is to go back to those voters and tell them how working together, we can make certain they thrive, and that will lead us to victory in November.\u201d In March, she launched her \u201cOne Georgia\u201d tour in front of a closed rural hospital, pledging to expand Medicaid if elected. Though she is recognized nationally for her work as a voting rights advocate and organizer, Abrams is \u2013 again \u2013 centering her campaign on the state\u2019s economic disparities and the intersection of race and health care in a state where the maternal mortality rate is more than twice the national average. Georgia early voting is surging as voters deal with new laws Leading Abrams supporters are confident her message will break through the national din. \u201cStacey has a very localized approach. And I think that\u2019s really important, because if we were to gauge how people are going to be voting based on the approval ratings of Biden, we know that that\u2019s going to be a disaster,\u201d said Michelle Sanchez, field director for Poder Latinx. \u201cBut she has been a champion here in Georgia for so long.\u201d As early voting in Georgia wrapped up ahead of Tuesday\u2019s vote, Abrams has also been attacked by Republicans over Democrats\u2019 denunciations of the state\u2019s restrictive new voting measures. Their argument: record turnout so far undermines any criticism or suggestion that they were passed in an attempt to suppress the vote. \u201cRemember when Biden smeared (Georgia\u2019s) election integrity law as \u2018Jim Crow 2.0\u2019?,\u201d Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel, a Trump ally, tweeted last week. But Abrams said the headline numbers do not account for the targeted nature of the law, known as SB 202. Black faith leaders push back after elimination of Sunday voting in one Georgia county \u201cThe moral equivalent of saying that voter turnout defuses or disproves voter suppression is like saying that more people getting in the water means there are no longer any sharks,\u201d she said. The state\u2019s new voting rules limit the number of drop boxes for absentee ballots and curtail the hours in which they are accessible; make it more difficult for voters to cast provisional ballots if they go to the wrong polling place; create new obstacles for voters seeking to cast their absentee ballots; and, in a move that made national headlines, prohibit groups from offering food or water within 25 feet of waiting voters or 150 feet of a polling place. \u201cWe have to remember, voter suppression isn\u2019t about stopping every voter,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cIt\u2019s about blocking and impeding those voters who are considered inconvenient.\u201d Despite Trump\u2019s unsettling of the Republican primary, the GOP campaign apparatus is poised to run a fierce campaign against Abrams in 2022. Democratic groups and Abrams\u2019 campaign know it, and believe they are better equipped \u2013 and funded \u2013 to enact the intensive groundwork that was a hallmark of her first run for governor. \u201cWhat has changed about her campaign is, simply, that they have more resources. So they have a larger budget and they have a bigger spotlight,\u201d said Abigail Collazo, Abrams\u2019 spokeswoman in 2018. Collazo pointed to the hiring of a full-time American Sign Language interpreter and director of constituent services \u2013 jobs traditionally attached to the offices of elected officials \u2013 to the new campaign as a choice example of its intent to immediately engage more deeply in underserved communities around the state. \u201cShe\u2019s not waiting for the job title. We\u2019ve now seen what you do and what you can do with additional funds,\u201d Collazo said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not just funneling it all into really expensive tech tools and the other stuff people pitch you.\u201d Organization among Democrats has also matured since 2018, when Abrams came within 2 points of defeating Kemp, who was then the secretary of state. The influence of Asian American voters, in particular, was also highlighted by Democrats\u2019 recent success in the state. Aisha Yaqoob Mahmood, executive director of Georgia\u2019s Asian American Advocacy Fund, which has endorsed Abrams, said that when Mahmood ran for a statehouse seat in 2018, there was no \u201ccohesive effort to mobilize Asian American communities for a progressive candidate.\u201d But Abrams\u2019 near-miss \u2013 along with Democratic successes in 2020 and 2021, which helped Biden to the presidency and delivered the party control of the Senate \u2013 changed the equation. \u201cNow there\u2019s just so much more attention and such a strategic support lined up for Stacey ahead of November,\u201d said Mahmood. \u201cWhether it\u2019s from her campaign directly \u2013 I\u2019m sure she\u2019s got an incredible strategy planned \u2013 but also generally from these independent political organizations like ours that are ready to really throw down in a way that, unfortunately, we didn\u2019t get to see in 2018.\u201d Grassroots organizers, like the Abrams-founded group New Georgia Project Action Fund, are confident an Abrams victory is possible because of the infrastructure they\u2019ve built, including a plan to turn out 150,000 new voters. \u201cWhat we learned is that we need to do a better job of reaching out to Black males. That was part and parcel, some of the reason that she was defeated. And we have been more intentional about reaching out to that demographic, not just New Georgia Project, but others in the progressive ecosystem,\u201d said Kendra Cotton, chief operating officer for New Georgia Project and its affiliated New Georgia Project Action Fund. Kimberlyn Carter, the executive director of Represent Georgia Action Network, also sees a path for Abrams. \u201cGeorgia is truly a state full of voters who are eager to be seen, heard and mobilized,\u201d said Carter, who argued the changing racial demographics of the state makes Democrats like Abrams more competitive than they were before in areas outside of the Atlanta metro region. The campaign will be won or lost at the local level, said Hillary Holley, formally the director of organizing and strategic adviser for Fair Fight, another Abrams-founded activist group. Holley worked on the 2018 campaign and says the devastation among Abrams\u2019 supporters is still raw. \u201cI think voters are ready to finish the job,\u201d she said. Kemp has traveled a bumpier road to his expected rematch with Abrams. While Abrams has no competition for the Democratic nomination, the governor is facing a Trump-backed primary challenge from former Sen. David Perdue, who lost his seat to Ossoff last year. Republicans look to Georgia for a path beyond Trump's 2020 grievances Though Kemp is poised to defeat Perdue, and Republicans in the state \u2013 whether they support Trump or not \u2013 appear to be brushing off the former President\u2019s input, the divisions underscored by Trump\u2019s involvement could potentially dampen GOP support for the incumbent in November. Kemp has largely ignored Perdue\u2019s stumbling campaign and, on Monday, sought to downplay Trump\u2019s opposition. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at him,\u201d Kemp said of the former President. \u201cI think he\u2019s just mad at me, and that\u2019s something that I can\u2019t control.\u201d Speaking to reporters on Saturday, Kemp pointed to his Democratic rival as the figure who, more than anyone else, would fire up any wavering GOP voters. \u201cI think Stacey Abrams is a great unifier,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cI think every Republican in Georgia will be unified after Tuesday.\u201d For her part, Abrams said she was \u201clooking forward to unifying all of Georgia.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she quipped, \u201c(Kemp) said I\u2019m halfway there.\u201d CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify Kendra Cotton\u2019s position as chief operating officer of New Georgia Project and its affiliated New Georgia Project Action Fund.",

            "article_content": "The Rev. Zachary Holmes spent part of last weekend assembling people to head to the polls ahead of Tuesday\u2019s primaries. But the church parking lot was a lot less crowded than it normally would have been. That\u2019s because it was Saturday, not Sunday. Previously, Holmes had conducted voting efforts on Sundays after church, as early voting on that day was popular for Black churchgoers. But, amid an ongoing fight over voting access in Georgia and nationwide, the Spalding County election board in April voted to eliminate the option. It is one of seven Georgia counties that had Sunday early voting in the 2020 election but will not have the option available for the midterms. In a show of resistance against the change in weekend voting options, Holmes, along with other community leaders in the county, held a so-called \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d event last Saturday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this mainly because we felt like the Sunday voting issue \u2013 it was a success. It got people out to vote and that should be our ultimate goal,\u201d said Holmes, a member of the school board running for reelection in this town of about 23,000 people an hour south of Atlanta. \u201cNo matter what party affiliation you have, we should want to increase participation in the voting process. And that was something that Sunday voting had done,\u201d Holmes said. Critics of Sunday early voting argue that the option is costly, but Spalding County community leaders don\u2019t buy that argument. They pushed back, arguing the change seemed racially motivated. \u201cThat\u2019s the strongest day for Black people. And I think this is something that is racial, and this is a way to control our numbers at the poll,\u201d said Michael Lawrence, the pastor at Griffin\u2019s Breakthrough Deliverance Church, from which organizers led a convoy of about 12 cars, complete with a police escort, to the local polling location. Before setting out, a group of about 10 people formed a circle in the sunny church parking lot and bowed their heads in prayer before breaking out into \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d In the Peach State, local boards of elections oversee voter registration lists and certifications of elections and decide when voting can take place. But those elections boards have been restructured under the state\u2019s voting law passed last year. Known as SB 202, the law allows for partisan takeovers of local election boards deemed low performing by state election officials. The GOP-led legislature also handed control of more election board appointments to conservative local judges or GOP-controlled county commissions in at least five counties \u2013 including Spalding \u2013 which shifted the balance of power on these boards. Spalding\u2019s new election board chair, Ben Johnson, was appointed last year by the county commissioner, James Dutton. He had argued against Sunday voting, saying that plenty of other options exist, including mail-in voting and the ability to cast ballots on two Saturdays during Georgia\u2019s 17-day early voting window. \u201cI still haven\u2019t heard anything that leads me to say that we absolutely have to do it,\u201d Johnson said of Sunday balloting when he voted to eliminate the option in April. \u201cI\u2019ve heard lots of emotional arguments and I sympathize with all of them. Anyone who only has Sunday off \u2013 God bless them \u2013 but we do have mail-in ballots available.\u201d The decision by the board to get rid of Sunday voting has brought concerns about voter suppression to the forefront for community members in Spalding. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Republicans are engaged in an effort to chill the right to vote in this state. It\u2019s so in your face. They\u2019re not even trying to hide it,\u201d said Dexter Wimbish, an attorney who participated in last Saturday\u2019s convoy to a Spalding County polling location. Wimbish sees Spalding County and the others that have eliminated Sunday voting as \u201cground zero\u201d for a Republican strategy to hold on to power in a diversifying area. \u201cYou have people who, you know, historically have been able to control the power structure in these communities, and they\u2019re not willing to give up that power without a struggle,\u201d he said. Spalding County is a predominantly Republican area \u2013 former President Donald Trump won about 60% of the vote here in 2020. But leaders here pointed out that the top-of-the-ticket results belie the demographics of a town like Griffin, where Black voters are actually the majority of the population; they just haven\u2019t traditionally turned out to vote. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to educate people about why we are going to the polls a little bit at a time,\u201d added Elbert Solomon, co-chair of the Spalding County Voting Project, which helped put on last Saturday\u2019s event. His group has been handing out door-hanging literature complete with a QR code that prompts people to check their voter registration status. \u201cVOTER SUPPRESSION is Alive & Well in Spalding County!\u201d reads the text on another piece of literature. \u201cVOTE ANYWAY!\u201d In fact, Georgia Republicans\u2019 enactment of restrictive voting laws since the 2020 election have some community leaders believing it may actually make people more motivated to cast a ballot in this year\u2019s midterms. \u201cHonestly, I used to not care about the vote,\u201d said Jibriel Dubignon, 38. But that changed, he said, when he saw the efforts to limit access to the franchise. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be important \u2013 they way they\u2019re fighting to take it from us \u2013 it has to be; it has to be powerful, otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be doing everything they\u2019re doing to make sure that we don\u2019t vote.\u201d Still, voting rights groups have noted a surge this year in early voting, even with the restrictions. Xakota Espinoza, of Fair Fight Action, founded by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, told CNN turnout rates for the primary have been high even amid the obstacles. \u201cVoters are more determined than ever to get out and cast their ballots. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not jumping through a number of obstacles, particularly voters who used to rely on Sunday voting, and are no longer able to,\u201d Espinoza said. As of May 16, more than 380,000 people had early voted in Georgia, according to the Secretary of State. It is nearly three times more than what it was in 2018, when a little more than 120,000 votes were cast. The rise of voter numbers comes even as Georgia Republicans work to recast voting laws in the state. In the last two years, the state\u2019s GOP-led legislature has passed two major voting bills that activists have said would hurt communities of color. The first, SB 202, created new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowered state officials to take over local elections boards, limited the use of ballot drop boxes and made it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food or water. This year\u2019s bill created an election police force with the power to investigate election fraud. Both pieces of legislation were signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be expending so much resources and controversy about taking our vote unless there was a reason and it was actually powerful and had the actual power to change some things,\u201d said Dubignon, who\u2019s now helping run his mother\u2019s campaign for state Senate. Faith leaders in other parts of the Peach State have also pushed back against the new laws by starting grassroots networks in a bid to help voters navigate the election rules. \u201cWe want to make sure that people understand fully what the rules are, and can vote accordingly. And that\u2019s really our focus, we\u2019re sending messages out weekly, just reminding people to check their registration status, to check their polling location,\u201d Rev. Lee May, a former DeKalb County government official and now pastor of Transforming Faith Church, told CNN. Lee added that voting rights activists are now more motivated to ensure they are turning out voters. \u201cIf somebody tries to take away something from you, you get more defiant,\u201d added Lee.",

            "article_content": "In the hours after Fox released a poll this week showing Pennsylvania Republican US Senate candidate Kathy Barnette locked in a statistical tie with primary opponents Mehmet Oz and Dave McCormick, allies of former President Donald Trump went to work trying to stifle her momentum. To sow doubt about her conservative bona fides, they circulated one of Barnette\u2019s tweets from July 2020 featuring the hashtags #BLM and #DefundThePolice \u2013 two rallying cries deployed by racial justice activists that Republicans seized on during the last election cycle. But a video accompanying the tweet told a much different story. \u201cAbolishing the police is stupid,\u201d Barnette declared through tears into the camera. \u201cDo not fall for these White liberals who are coming into our communities and telling us we need to remove law enforcement.\u201d The episode illustrates the problem that Trump, who endorsed Oz in the Pennsylvania primary, is facing as he and his allies try to prevent both a dark horse victory by Barnette in the final week of the race and another blemish on his endorsement record, following the defeat of his chosen candidate in Nebraska\u2019s gubernatorial primary this week. The situation has left Trump feeling \u201cnervous about Oz\u2019s prospects,\u201d according to one Trump adviser, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal. \u201cFor the past five months, he\u2019s been told the only threat to Oz is named David McCormick. This is a twist no one saw coming,\u201d the adviser said. Why May matters for the future of the Senate Another person close to Trump who has been supportive of Oz described the situation as \u201ca nightmare.\u201d In interviews with CNN, this person and three other Trump allies described Barnette, who nabbed endorsements late Tuesday from the socially conservative groups Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote and a seven-figure investment from the Club for Growth, as a major threat to both Oz and McCormick in the last stretch of the race. In an unexpected move on Tuesday, the Club for Growth announced that it would spend $1.9 million to boost Barnette on the airwaves in Pennsylvania between now and the May 17 primary \u2013 a significant development for a candidate who has spent $160,000 on TV since launching her campaign in April 2021 in a race that has seen nearly $50 million in combined spending by her opponents and outside groups. \u201cI don\u2019t think people were expecting Kathy Barnette to come up the middle this hard right in the last week,\u201d one Trump ally said. \u201cThe biggest story in the last week of this race is her momentum, and so she\u2019s getting both earned and paid media. That\u2019s a two-for-one.\u201d Barnette\u2019s late rise in the polls has also left her opponents little time to change the way voters see her, leaving her in a less vulnerable position than Oz and McCormick, who have been working for months to cast each other in an unflattering light. \u201cYou can go negative on her, but you only have a week to introduce her in a negative way and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much from a conservative perspective. I haven\u2019t heard of anything where I\u2019ve thought, \u2018Oh, yes, this will be very effective,\u2019 \u201d the Trump ally said. Oz himself called Barnette a \u201cmystery\u201d durign an interview on Sean Hannity\u2019s show  on Fox Wednesday night, expressing concern about her electability amid her late polling surge. \u201cShe is a mystery person, we don\u2019t know much about her, and we have to be able to learn, and she\u2019s not willing to share,\u201d Oz said. The former President is still determining whether there is anything he can do to give Oz an extra boost in the race, the adviser to Trump said, noting that Trump was already planning to host a tele-rally and to target Republican voters with robocalls before the primary. Trump also held a campaign rally outside of Pittsburgh last Friday, where he repeatedly tore into McCormick to turn on-the-fence voters against him. \u201cHe is absolutely the candidate of special interests and globalists and the Washington establishment. \u2026 David is totally controlled \u2026 by Mitch McConnell, the old crow, the old broken-down crow,\u201d Trump said. Notably, the former President did not mention Barnette once in his remarks. Inside Trump\u2019s orbit, Barnette\u2019s swift rise from obscurity to a legitimate competitor is seen as a direct result of the mud-slinging contest that has unfolded between Oz and McCormick over the past several months. It\u2019s a classic case of a candidate running up the middle, said allies of the former President, with one likening Barnette to Sen. Deb Fischer, whose bare-bones campaign defeated two well-funded tea party darlings in the 2012 Nebraska GOP Senate primary. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 McCormick and Oz, both self-funders, have each spent more than $10 million on television advertising so far, most of it on vicious attack ads against one another. Though Oz received Trump\u2019s formal backing last month, McCormick has continued to raise questions about his opponent\u2019s MAGA credentials while casting himself as a true ally of the 45th President. \u201cDave, I want to congratulate you. You\u2019ve served our country well in so many different ways,\u201d Trump could be heard telling McCormick in an old video clip featured in an ad launched by McCormick\u2019s campaign this week. The heated battle between Oz and McCormick that has been playing out on the television screens of Pennsylvanians has left both men with significantly higher unfavorable ratings than Barnette, according to the Fox poll, which found that 46% of Pennsylvania Republican primary voters do not view Oz favorably. That has created a giant opening for Barnette in the closing days of the race, said one of the Trump allies. \u201cFor four to five months now, McCormick and Oz have spent millions of dollars nuking each other. Who would you rather be?\u201d said the Trump adviser. Still, allies of Barnette expect both of her main opponents to direct some of their attacks toward her now that she is registering as more of a threat in polls. \u201c\u2018I\u2019m sure they will go after her. There\u2019s no doubt they will do something,\u201d said former Kansas US Rep. Tim Huelskamp, a senior adviser to CatholicVote, which praised Barnette as \u201cgenuinely pro-life\u201d and claimed she is \u201cnow within striking distance\u201d of her competitors in an endorsement announcement on Tuesday. \u201cBut if they do that, they will just draw attention to the fact that she is what they are trying to be: an authentic conservative and Pennsylvanian,\u201d Huelskamp added. As Huelskamp\u2019s group launches a pro-Barnette text message campaign that will target church-attending Catholics in the state who the group has identified as anti-abortion Republicans, the other boost for Barnette will come from the Club for Growth\u2019s ad buy. The group\u2019s $1.9 million ad blitz for Barnette caught several Trump allies off guard who had been expecting Club for Growth President David McIntosh to keep a low profile after his relationship with the former President took a nasty turn in the final weeks of the Ohio US Senate primary. McIntosh had directed the Club for Growth to continue attacking J.D. Vance on the airwaves following Trump\u2019s endorsement of him, though Vance still prevailed against his Club-backed opponent, Josh Mandel, in the end. \u201cThis was the thing that really made people take notice, because before the Club\u2019s investment, the thinking was that she has some momentum but the others are going to spend millions of dollars this week and just drown her out,\u201d said one of the Trump allies. \u201cEven when her numbers started to tick up, no one expected her to have the resources to get up on TV. That obviously changes if the Club is going to spend $2 million on her now,\u201d this person added. An Oz loss \u2013 either to Barnette or McCormick \u2013 could mark the beginning of a rough patch for Trump, who has backed several candidates competing in contested primaries this month. May primaries set to test Trump's touch as GOP kingmaker In addition to Pennsylvania, where Trump was ultimately convinced to get behind Oz by his wife, Melania, and allies like Fox host Sean Hannity, he has endorsed Rep. Ted Budd in North Carolina, who is also competing in a Senate primary next Tuesday, against former GOP Gov. Pat McCrory. And later this month, Trump will have multiple candidates competing in primaries across Georgia, including gubernatorial challenger David Perdue, whom Trump personally recruited as he works to rid the GOP of elected officials \u2013 like incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp \u2013 who have refused to embrace his disproven claims about the 2020 election. With the exception of Charles Herbster\u2019s defeat in Nebraska amid several allegations of sexual misconduct, Trump has been able to reasonably claim so far that his endorsement does indeed make a difference in competitive races \u2013 carrying Vance from a possible third-place finish to a comfortable win in last week\u2019s Ohio US Senate primary and giving a boost to Rep. Alex Mooney in a heated West Virginia congressional primary this week. This story has been updated with additional reaction. CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Demographic change continues to steadily reshape the American electorate, but the barriers to emerging groups gaining political power commensurate with their growing numbers may be even greater than previously understood, according to a new analysis of population and voting trends that\u2019s stirring private debate in Democratic circles. The new study contends that while people of color will continue their steady growth to become nearly 2 in every 5 eligible voters by 2030, the gap in voter turnout between minorities and Whites, as well as between younger and older generations, is even wider than commonly understood. \u201cThe data say we have a big problem, bigger than we thought,\u201d says Tom Lopach, president and CEO of the Voter Participation Center and the Center for Voter Information, the two liberal-leaning non-profit groups that released the report last week. The groups focus on increasing participation among what they call the \u201cNew American Majority\u201d \u2013 unmarried women, voters younger than 35 and people of color, all constituencies that mostly vote Democratic (even though Republicans have made recent gains among some of them). The study\u2019s conclusions could inflame the already smoldering debate among Democrats over where the party should place its greatest electoral emphasis. While the study\u2019s sponsors say it shows the need for greater efforts to energize younger and non-White adults now voting at lower rates, it could also encourage the rising chorus of centrist party voices who say Democrats must emphasize positions more popular with moderate and even right-leaning adults who are more reliable voters. That pool of potential supporters includes some Hispanics but is centered on the non-college-educated White voters whose generation-long shift toward the GOP became a stampede in the Donald Trump era. The study also points to a more civic, less partisan, challenge: a widening gap between an increasingly diverse population, especially among younger generations, and electoral results disproportionately shaped by the preferences of White voters, particularly older White voters. That could be a formula for growing social tension, political polarization and doubts about the legitimacy of governmental decisions. Democracy \u2026 only works if the folks that are voting, that are offering their voice, represent the needs, the values of the [entire] country. Ben Deufel, vice president of innovation, learning and impact at the Voter Participation Center \u201cDemocracy \u2026 only works if the folks that are voting, that are offering their voice, represent the needs, the values of the [entire] country,\u201d says Ben Deufel, vice president of innovation, learning and impact at the Voter Participation Center. The fact that the disparity in turnout between Whites and minorities may be even greater than recognized, he adds, \u201cis counteracting against that.\u201d Other Democratic voter mobilization experts I spoke with generally believe the study is unduly pessimistic about minority participation and exaggerates the turnout gap between Whites and people of color. The study places turnout among Black and Latino voters at a much lower level not only than the official Census Bureau numbers, which many experts think are inflated, but also than the estimates by Catalist, a leading Democratic voter-targeting firm. If any statistical study \u201ccomes out with a conclusion that means all these other things you have been believing are true are (actually) false, then they have a very high standard of proof to say not only why they are right but (also why) everybody else was wrong,\u201d said one highly placed Democratic expert in voter turnout who asked for anonymity to candidly critique the report. Yet even some of those who privately questioned the report to me said it served an important purpose by highlighting the persistence of the racial and generational turnout gaps \u2013 which could be exacerbated even further in the next few election cycles because many of the Sun Belt states experiencing the most rapid demographic change are among the states constructing the most new barriers to voting. If the turnout gap is even bigger than commonly recognized, Lopach says, and \u201cthe governmental and legislative response is to make it harder to vote \u2026 that is deeply concerning.\u201d One of the study\u2019s most important conclusions draws little dispute: its forecast that the potential electorate will continue to diversify. The report projects that people of color will grow from 28% of eligible voters in 2010 and 34% in 2020 to just over 38% by 2030. Adding in all the groups the organization defines as the \u201cNew American Majority\u201d \u2013 all people of color, White unmarried women and White voters under 35 \u2013 raises the total from 57% of eligible voters in 2010 to 63% in 2030. If anything, that total may slightly understate the impact of demographic and generational change on the electorate over the coming decade, Bill Frey, a demographer and senior fellow at Brookings Metro, noted in an email. In measuring the size of its \u201cNew American Majority\u201d the reports counts only voters younger than 35 at any given point. But by 2030, Frey points out, that definition excludes almost all Whites in the millennial generation (generally defined as people born between 1981 and 1996), who have also expressed more liberal views, particularly on cultural issues, than older generations. Including those White millennials would push the share represented by the \u201cNew American Majority\u201d even higher. We speak about Asian Americans as a single block. Here's how incredibly complex they are Even using its more restrictive definition, the report projects that the share of eligible voters represented by these three groups will increase from 2020 to 2030 in every state except for Arkansas and Alabama (where they are already relatively high). By 2030, it estimates, these groups will compose at least two-thirds or more of the eligible population in three Sun Belt states that now lean at least slightly toward Republicans: Florida, Georgia and Texas. The report ranks Florida and Texas, as well as Arizona, another Sun Belt battleground that still leans slightly Republican, among the states where the three groups will increase their share of the population fastest. These projections about the pool of future eligible voters, as Frey notes, are broadly in line with other recent forecasts, such as the nonpartisan States of Change project, which he advises. More controversial is the report\u2019s conclusions about who votes. It estimates White turnout was higher in 2020 and turnout among Blacks and Hispanics was considerably lower than other major data sources have concluded. The Census Bureau, for instance, estimated that the share of Whites who turned out in 2020 (just over 70%) was about 9 percentage points higher than the share of African Americans (61%) and about 18 points higher than the share of Latinos (52%). Catalist, the Democratic targeting firm, put the gaps somewhat wider, at 11 points between Whites and Blacks and 24 points between Whites and Latinos. But the new study found a much more forbidding chasm. For 2020 it placed the White turnout gap at 25 points with Blacks and at nearly 35 points with Latinos. (The report concludes that only a little over half of eligible Blacks and two-fifths of Latinos voted.) What\u2019s more, the study concluded that the turnout gap between Whites and all voters of color was at least 14 points in every state and even higher in many states where Democrats and progressive groups have spent heavily on grassroots organizing and/or voter turnout efforts \u2013 including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania \u2013 than in states where neither side invests much money, including Alabama and South Carolina. In the 2016 election, the new study likewise concludes, turnout among Blacks and Hispanics was much lower than either the Census Bureau or Catalist had found, while White turnout was slightly higher than either had estimated. Looking back over the past three presidential elections, the report concluded the turnout gap between Whites and all non-Whites has actually expanded \u2013 more than doubling, in fact, over that period. The reason is that even though the share of all minorities casting ballots slightly increased from 2012 to 2020, White turnout has increased much more, according to the study\u2019s estimates. How did the study reach such different conclusions from other analysts about turnout rates? The answer is that all studies, when calculating turnout, pretty much use the same denominator \u2013 the Census Bureau\u2019s estimates of the citizen voting-age population by race and age. But this study in effect used a different numerator. It estimated the racial and age characteristics of the voters in the past three elections based on data from a company that analyzes state voter files to see who has actually cast a ballot. (Under contract, the authors told me, they cannot reveal the company \u2013 though the report, and my interview with the authors, made clear the source is not Catalist, whose own publicly released analysis of the voter file produced the different conclusions cited above.) In most states, data is not available on the races of people who vote in each election. So the firms that analyze voter lists use statistical models to project the race of each voter. The reason this study concludes that Black and Latino turnout was much lower, and White turnout was higher, is because the voter file it used identifies many more of 2020\u2019s voters as White than other measures have done, such as the Catalist analysis, the network exit polls conducted by Edison Research, the Pew Research Center\u2019s validated voters study and the Census Bureau findings. We need to be reaching out and talking to Latino voters, young voters, African American voters constantly. It can\u2019t be just a quick hit in a presidential election year and then walk away. We need to ensure that these voters feel connected to their democracy. Tom Lopach, president and CEO of the Voter Participation Center and the Center for Voter Information Emory University political scientist Bernard Fraga, one of the study\u2019s authors, argues the estimates it relies on are more reliable than the Census Bureau figures, which he says have been \u201cwildly overestimating\u201d minority turnout. But he acknowledges that any study based on analysis of the voter files \u2013 which requires its own assumptions and calculations about the races of voters \u2013 \u201cis really tricky and fraught and becomes very complicated very fast politically for a lot of reasons.\u201d Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist considered one of the nation\u2019s leading experts on voter turnout, says this study should be seen as just one possibility rather than an inherently more accurate picture. \u201cIt is useful as another measurement of turnout, but voter file data introduces a different set of confounds and biases than survey data,\u201d he told me in an email. \u201cThere is no guarantee the voter file or CPS [the Census Bureau data] better reflects the \u2018truth.\u2019\u201d Lopach, the CEO of the groups that released the study, says that even if \u201cthe truth is in the middle\u201d between the estimates of minority turnout from the Census Bureau and the conclusions of the report, it means \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u201d To him, the message is that progressive groups cannot expect to meaningfully close these racial turnout gaps just by pouring money into minority communities right around elections but instead must invest much more in what he called \u201csustained, continued work\u201d to better connect those voters to the political system. \u201cWe need to be reaching out and talking to Latino voters, young voters, African American voters constantly,\u201d Lopach says. \u201cIt can\u2019t be just a quick hit in a presidential election year and then walk away. We need to ensure that these voters feel connected to their democracy.\u201d Fraga argues that such an effort is the most realistic response to the growing Democratic concern that the political system is stacked against them because the Electoral College and the Senate provide inordinate influence to small, heavily rural, preponderantly White and Christian Plains and Mountain states that Republicans dominate. While there\u2019s little chance of changing the Senate or the Electoral College, Democrats could more plausibly offset the biases in both institutions by growing more competitive in states across the South and Southwest through massive increases in voting among their growing populations of minorities and young people, says Fraga, author of the 2018 book \u201cThe Turnout Gap.\u201d \u201cMany of these proposed reforms are way pie-in-the-sky,\u201d he argues. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk about remedying the turnout disparities and investing in that rather than getting some of these major institutional reforms?\u201d It's not just Latinos and younger voters. Democrats are slipping among Black voters too. A big obstacle to that vision, as I\u2019ve written, is that many of the Sun Belt states where the demographic change is advancing most quickly are also among those where the Republicans now holding statewide power are erecting the most obstacles to voting, including Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas. Another problem is President Joe Biden\u2019s sagging approval rating among younger and non-White voters. Many political operatives agree that investing more in the mechanics of turnout usually isn\u2019t enough if voters don\u2019t also feel inspired to get off their couches, and Biden\u2019s decline is raising Democratic anxieties about flagging midterm turnout, particularly among young people. After Trump\u2019s surprising gains among Hispanic voters in 2020, Democratic concerns also are mounting that the GOP may be solidifying its gains with that growing group (which this study, like others, projects will increase its share of the overall non-White population through this decade). For all these reasons, while the groups sponsoring the study believe its findings argue for increased efforts to turn out younger and non-White voters, the results could also encourage the Democratic operatives and analysts who are arguing the party can\u2019t rely on such mobilization. Since 2020 that loose circle \u2013 which includes Democratic voices such as David Shor, Ruy Teixeira, Bill Galston and Elaine Kamarck \u2013 has argued that the party must instead focus on winning back more working-class voters, especially Whites but also increasingly Latinos, by moving toward the center, particularly on cultural issues such as crime and immigration. To the extent Democrats accept the conclusions of this report that the generational and racial turnout gaps are even bigger and more intractable than they have believed, it will only strengthen those arguments. And if the midterm elections go as badly for the party as now seems possible, every Democratic faction is likely to be very much in the mood for an argument on the morning after Election Day in November.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in the CITIZEN BY CNN newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. A new map signed into law last week by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis will eliminate two Black-led congressional districts in Florida. On the chopping block: Florida\u2019s 5th Congressional District, currently represented by Democrat Al Lawson, which connects Black communities from Tallahassee to Jacksonville. Under the new map, Jacksonville, the city with the largest Black population in the state, is divided into two Republican-leaning districts. Also skewered: the 10th Congressional District, currently represented by Rep. Val Demings, a Black Democrat. The new map reduces Black voters in the Orlando-area district. Demings is currently running for the US Senate. The map is expected to expand Republicans\u2019 current 16-11 seat advantage in congressional districts to as many as 20 out of 28 districts \u2013 and possibly help Republicans flip control of the US House of Representatives this November. Many Democrats and voting rights advocates denounced the move and even attempted to stop the passage of the new maps with a protest on the state House floor. State Rep. Angie Nixon, one of the Democrats who protested loudly on the House floor, has called the map \u201can attack on democracy\u201d and DeSantis \u201ca bully.\u201d She told Politico that Republican leaders were \u201cwilling to lie, cheat and steal to maintain their stranglehold of power on the state of Florida.\u201d The map was pushed by DeSantis himself. The GOP governor and likely 2024 presidential contender bucked tradition this year by injecting himself into the decennial redistricting process. He first created his own map earlier this year. The governor then vetoed a previous version passed by the GOP-led legislature that maintained the current level of Black districts. DeSantis argued that the current congressional districts were racially gerrymandered and has suggested they are unconstitutional. The map he signed into law this past week, he says, is \u201crace neutral.\u201d Less than 24 hours after the GOP-supported maps were passed, the first legal challenge was filed. The lawsuit was filed by a coalition of civil rights groups, including Black Voters Matter and the League of Women Voters of Florida. The lawsuit argues that the new maps violate a 2010 state constitutional amendment, Fair Districts, that requires lawmakers to give minority communities an opportunity to \u201celect representatives of their choice.\u201d The move in Florida comes against the backdrop of growing political power for people of color \u2013 and fears that redistricting maneuvers will muffle their voices. When the current session of Congress convened in January 2021, it set a high watermark for minority representation: Nearly one-quarter of voting members of the US House and Senate of the 117th Congress were racial or ethnic minorities, according to the Pew Research Center. A record 59 lawmakers were African American. Democrats made up 83% of the members of color, while 17% of the non-White members were Republican. The new map is just one of the attention-getting laws enacted in Florida in recent days. On Monday, DeSantis signed a sweeping voting law that establishes a new elections police force \u2013 making Florida one of the first states in the country with a unit focused on election fraud, an exceedingly rare problem that has become a rallying issue for some GOP voters. Voting rights groups have raised alarms that an election police unit under the purview of a partisan governor could turn into a political weapon. During a news conference, DeSantis said local election supervisors and prosecutors don\u2019t necessarily have the expertise to investigate voting-related complaints and the new officers will. \u201cWe just want to make sure whatever laws are on the books that those laws are enforced,\u201d the governor added. In an earlier newsletter, we highlighted the legislative maneuvers of Arizona state Rep. Rusty Bowers. The Arizona House Speaker is perhaps best known in the state for not caving under pressure from Donald Trump\u2019s allies to somehow overturn the former President\u2019s 2020 loss in the state. Now, the Mesa-area Republican is a recipient of the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award \u2013 one of five people recognized by the late President\u2019s library foundation for defending democracy at home and abroad. The foundation\u2019s honorees also include another little-known figure, whose life was disrupted for simply doing her job: Fulton County, Georgia, election worker Wandrea \u201cShaye\u201d Moss. She had become the target of false accusations that she had processed fraudulent ballots for President Joe Biden in the last presidential election. She and Ruby Freeman \u2013 her mother who served as a temporary Fulton County election worker during the 2020 election \u2013 had faced racist taunts and death threats in the aftermath of those accusations. (The women recently reached a settlement with One America News Network in their defamation suit against the outlet, according to a status report filed with the US District Court in Washington late last week. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.) In its praise for Moss, the JFK foundation said that: \u201cDespite the onslaught of random, undeserved, and malicious attacks, Moss continues to serve in the Fulton County Department of Registration & Elections doing the hard and unseen work to run our democracy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Just 41% of young Americans approve of President Joe Biden\u2019s job performance, according to a new Harvard Institute of Politics poll of adults ages 18-29 released on Monday. That\u2019s down from 46% in fall 2021 and a 59% majority last spring \u2013 a trend also seen in other recent surveys. By comparison, according to past Harvard IOP polling, only 25% of young Americans approved of then-President Donald Trump heading into the 2018 midterm cycle. Twelve years ago, however, 56% approved of then-President Barack Obama ahead of the first midterm cycle of his presidency, when Democrats went on to lose the House in 2010. Young adults give Biden better ratings for his handling of the coronavirus (52%) and the way he\u2019s addressed the situation in Ukraine (46% approve) than they do for his handling of the economy (34% approve). That\u2019s a similar pattern to how the full American public views Biden\u2019s handling of the issues. Why young voters probably won't cost Democrats in 2022 A 69% majority of young voters who backed Biden in the 2020 election still approve of his job performance. Those young Biden voters who\u2019ve soured on the President differ from those who still approve of his performance in a number of ways, the survey finds. \u201cOverall, Biden voters who now disapprove of his performance rate him more harshly on the economy,\u201d John Della Volpe, Harvard IOP\u2019s polling director, writes in the survey\u2019s release. \u201c(T)hey see the current political system as ineffectual; they view the President as putting the interests of the elite over their own; they consume less political information; are more likely to be on Twitter; have less hope about the future; are more liberal; and more passionate about (canceling) student debt for everyone.\u201d The poll, which surveyed 2,024 US adults between the ages of 18 and 29, was conducted on March 15-30 using a nationally representative online panel. The margin of error for the total sample is +/- 2.89 percentage points. Young Americans\u2019 political disenchantment isn\u2019t confined to opinions of Biden. Just 40% approve of congressional Democrats\u2019 job performance, down from 52% in March 2021. And an even lower 31% approve of congressional Republicans\u2019 performance, little changed from 28% last spring. And compared to spring 2018 \u2013 heading into the previous midterm cycle \u2013 young adults are more likely to agree with pessimistic sentiments about politics and their own political efficacy. A 56% majority say they agree that \u201cpolitics today are no longer able to meet the challenges our country is facing,\u201d up from 45% in 2018. Currently, 36% agree that \u201cpolitical involvement rarely has any tangible results,\u201d up from 22% four years ago. In an interview with CNN, Ed Kakenmaster, a 27-year-old who lives in Chicago, said he believes \u201cyounger people are burnt out by political discussions.\u201d \u201cFor a lot of my friends it\u2019s like, \u2018Alright let\u2019s have fun and not talk about it as much,\u2019 so it will be interesting to see what happens in 2022 because I think there may be quite a few people who don\u2019t turn out to vote.\u201d In the Harvard poll, 36% of adults under 30 say they \u201cdefinitely\u201d plan to vote in the midterms, similar to the 37% who said the same at this stage in 2018. While Kakenmaster said he cast a ballot for Biden in 2020, citing qualms with Trump, he said he is \u201cconservative leaning\u201d and plans to vote Republican in 2022. He listed rising crime, dissatisfaction with Chicago Democrats\u2019 Covid-19 response, the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan and inflation as reasons why he will vote for the GOP in 2022. \u201cWith inflation and how he has blamed (Russian President Vladimir) Putin and Covid, and his failure to take responsibility for inflation \u2013 that is something that has rubbed me the wrong way because he\u2019s the President, and you kind of expect for him to take ownership of that,\u201d Kakenmaster said of Biden. In the Harvard poll, 29% of young Americans name economic-related topics such as inflation and cost of living when asked to name the national issue that concerned them most. Another 18% name foreign policy or national security issues, with 8% mentioning environmental issues. Just 4% cite Covid-19 as their top concern. Here's who is eligible for student loan debt relief after Biden's latest actions Yet for her part, Krezzia Basilio, a 20-year-old first generation Filipino American, told CNN she still considers Covid to be one the biggest national hurdles, and as a student at University of California, she said it directly impacts her life on campus. She also listed wages and student loan forgiveness as issues she prioritizes. \u201cI know that Biden\u2019s been talking a lot about loan forgiveness, which I think is very important, but I hope I can actually see it happen,\u201d she said. The Biden administration\u2019s latest action on student debt will bring 3.6 million borrowers closer to loan forgiveness, CNN reported last week. Basilio, who identified herself as on the left, said that while there is \u201cnot as much social media hype as compared to a presidential election,\u201d she is \u201cjust as equally motivated to vote\u201d in 2022 as she was in 2020. \u201cAs a voter in California voting on ballots like the presidential election, I don\u2019t think my vote carries that much weight,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I definitely feel like when it comes to propositions and more local elections, I feel like our vote definitely matters much more.\u201d When asked by CNN what she views as the key issues ahead of the midterms, Caitlyn Foret, a 19-year-old student at the University of Houston who called herself \u201cleft leaning,\u201d told CNN she views \u201cpolarization\u201d as one of the biggest issues facing America today. Foret said she encourages younger voters to vote less on party labels and more on \u201call points of policy.\u201d Many young Americans in minority groups also feel under threat because of their identity, the Harvard poll finds. A 59% majority of young Black adults say people of their racial background are under attack \u201ca lot,\u201d as do 43% of young Asian American and Pacific Islander adults, 37% of young Hispanic adults, and 19% of young White adults. The share of young Black Americans who feel under a lot of attack is similar to where it stood five years ago, while the share of young Hispanic Americans who feel a similar level of threat has decreased since 2017. Just under half of \u201cLGBTQ-identifying youth,\u201d 45%, say they feel as though people with their sexual orientation are under attack a lot. And 46% of young Republicans say they believe those who share their political views are under attack a lot, compared with 24% of young Democrats who say the same. Jack Dillard, a 23-year-old from Atlanta who voted for Trump in 2020, said it is \u201ca positive\u201d that in \u201cpeople are more comfortable sharing their opinions and voicing their own concerns\u201d in today\u2019s political climate. He added that all opinions should be \u201cequally valued.\u201d Yet, as a Trump-supporting conservative, Dillard said he is hesitant to speak out about his beliefs. \u201cI don\u2019t post about my politic(s),\u201d he said, referring to his social media habits, \u201cbecause I feel as though that\u2019s not the norm.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia testified under oath for three hours Friday at an unprecedented disqualification hearing that focused on whether she is constitutionally barred from holding office because of her role in the January 6 insurrection. On the witness stand, Greene repeated debunked claims that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election, and even brought up false-flag conspiracy theories that the US Capitol was attacked by rogue FBI agents or racial justice activists who \u201cdressed up as Trump supporters.\u201d Her testimony, during an extraordinary all-day hearing in Atlanta, makes Greene the first member of Congress to answer questions under oath about their activities related to January 6. The candidacy challenge was initiated by a group of Georgia voters, who are working with a coalition of liberal activists and constitutional scholars. They face an uphill climb to remove Greene from the ballot, and the judge on Friday appeared skeptical of some of their arguments. Their lawyers grilled Greene about her ties to the far-right provocateurs and extremist groups who fueled the carnage at the Capitol. But her testimony did not establish that she had been aware of plans for violence or that she had coordinated with any rioters \u2013 and she deflected many questions about her activities before January 6 by saying more than 50 times that she couldn\u2019t remember. What to know about Friday's January 6-focused hearing on the bid to disqualify Marjorie Taylor Greene \u201cI was asking people to come for a peaceful march, which is what everyone is entitled to do under their First Amendment, but I was not asking them to actively engage in violence or any type of action,\u201d Greene testified, pushing back on the assertion that she had aided the insurrection. The case revolves around a Civil War-era provision of the 14th Amendment, which says any American official who takes an oath to uphold the Constitution is disqualified from holding any future office if they had \u201cengaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\u201d But how this applies today is a hotly debated legal question. State Judge Charles Beaudrot, who presided over the all-day hearing, is expected to issue his recommendation within the next few weeks. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, will then take Beaudrot\u2019s findings and decide whether to disqualify Greene from the May 17 primary. The outcome in the case could have national implications, because liberal attorneys have said they will mount a similar challenge against Trump if he runs again for president in 2024. Without direct evidence linking Greene to any rioters, the challengers focused on her rhetoric and how her calls to action in the weeks before January 6 had potentially inspired the insurrection. \u201cShe was one of several leaders who gathered the kindling, who created the conditions, who made it possible for there to be an explosion of violence at the Capitol on January 6. And then, she dropped the match,\u201d Andrew Celli, lawyer for the challengers, said in his closing arguments. \u201cNow, she comes into this courtroom and says she\u2019s surprised and appalled that a fire burned.\u201d At times, the proceedings felt like a legalistic cat-and-mouse game, with the challengers trying to pin Greene down on her previous comments, including some that appeared to stoke violence. She said she didn\u2019t remember saying she opposed the peaceful transfer of power to President Joe Biden \u2013 right before lawyers for the challengers played a video of her saying just that. She denied calling House Speaker Nancy Pelosi a \u201ctraitor\u201d who might deserve the death penalty, but backtracked and acknowledged the comment when the challengers started to play the footage. Celli asked Greene if she had liked a Facebook post that said, \u201ca bullet to the head would be a quicker way to remove\u201d Pelosi. (CNN previously unearthed the liked post, and others where Greene indicated supported for executing prominent Democrats.) \u201cI have had many people manage my social media account over the years,\u201d Greene replied, in reference to the threatening post about Pelosi from 2019. \u201cI have no idea who liked that.\u201d She said she had never intended to promote violence on January 6 and that she didn\u2019t recall any conversations with lawmakers or Trump officials about disrupting the Electoral College count. \u201cI only believe in peaceful demonstration,\u201d Greene said. \u201cI do not support violence.\u201d She also denied giving any tours of the Capitol complex before the attack, rejecting the still unproven allegation from some Democratic lawmakers that the rioters had insider assistance. Greene entered the courtroom to rousing applause and cheers from supporters. A court security official swiftly chastised the crowd and the judge later warned that outbursts would not be tolerated. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who has joined Greene at events in support of the January 6 defendants, sat with her legal team for most of the proceedings. Her attorney, James Bopp Jr., called the hearing a \u201cpolitical show trial\u201d and said the affair was a massive violation of her constitutional rights. When the challengers questioned Greene, Bopp repeatedly interrupted with objections \u2013 and the judge agreed on several key occasions, leading him to rein in the challengers and telling them at one point, \u201cYou are pushing the envelope.\u201d Bopp briefly questioned Greene on the witness stand, calling her a \u201cvictim\u201d of January 6 and focusing on the fear she had felt while she was escorted to safety that day. She was on the House floor, objecting to Biden\u2019s electoral votes from Arizona, when the mob breached the building. \u201ci was scared,\u201d Greene testified, even though she later said that some of the rioters were patriots. \u201cI was concerned. I was shocked. \u2026 I had no idea what was going on. \u2026 I did not want to see anyone get hurt. It was very upsetting. I was very upset.\u201d The hearing itself was something Greene had hoped to avoid. She had filed a federal lawsuit to shut down the state process \u2013 which is how GOP Rep. Madison Cawthorn fended off a similar challenge in North Carolina. But in a blistering 75-page ruling on Monday, a federal judge rejected many of Greene\u2019s legal arguments and cleared the way for Friday\u2019s hearing. The challenges against Greene and Cawthorn are backed by Free Speech for People, a legal advocacy group, and Our Revolution, a left-wing group founded by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. They are appealing the court ruling in North Carolina, which effectively killed their anti-Cawthorn efforts. The burden of proof is on the challengers to show by a \u201cmore likely than not\u201d standard that January 6 was legally an insurrection and Greene actively aided the insurrectionists. Beaudrot, the judge, said the legal questions at play were \u201cdeadly serious\u201d and repeatedly tried to maintain some level of order during the circus-like hearing. Post-trial briefs are due next Thursday, and Beaudrot is expected to issue his recommendation sometime within the next few weeks. The decision whether to disqualify Greene will be made by Raffensperger, who was infamously on the receiving end of a call where Trump pressured him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to overturn Biden\u2019s surprise victory in Georgia. Georgia\u2019s primary ballots are already being printed, so if Greene is disqualified, state officials will post notices at polling places announcing that she is not an eligible candidate and votes for her will not be counted. Greene can appeal a disqualification in state courts. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.

            "article_content": "The class of public high school seniors who receive their diplomas this June will be the first one ever in which kids of color make up a majority of the graduates, according to federal projections. By the second half of this decade, the federal government projects, those non-White young people will soar to about 55% of the nation\u2019s public high school graduates, meaning they will likely constitute the majority of kids completing 12th grade through the foreseeable future. Even as this momentous transition is unfolding, the Republican-appointed majority on the Supreme Court recently accepted two cases for its next session that it may use to ban or severely restrict the use of affirmative action to increase the share of minority students admitted to colleges and universities. Precisely as young people of color are positioned to become most of the nation\u2019s high school graduates, in other words, the court\u2019s GOP-appointed majority may hobble or even bar any effort to bolster their representation in the elite higher education institutions that serve as critical gatekeepers in apportioning opportunity across American society. That coincidental, but revealing, convergence of legal and demographic change captures the core conflict that Ketanji Brown Jackson, the incoming Supreme Court justice the Senate confirmed last week, will both inherit and sharpen. On issues from voting rights to abortion, affirmative action, climate change and religious exemptions from civil laws, the Supreme Court\u2019s majority of Republican-appointed justices appears poised to issue a succession of rulings that enshrine into law the values and priorities of the older, culturally conservative White voters at the core of the modern GOP coalition. On all of those issues, and others, the GOP-appointed court majority is likely to repeatedly rule against not only the policy preferences but also in many ways the core identities of Americans who are younger, more racially diverse, less inclined to affiliate with any religious tradition and more likely to identify as LGBTQ. We will have this very clear visual of a group of White people trying to rip away rights from Black and brown people while sitting across from Black and brown people with more qualifications than them. It will be the kind of images we have seen in our civil rights movies and seen in our civil rights books. Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change Once Jackson, the first Black woman confirmed to the court, replaces Justice Stephen Breyer later this year, all three of the Democratic appointees on the court will be women, two of them women of color. They will face off against a GOP majority that comprises four White men, one White woman and one African American man. With that stark alignment in place, the demographic divisions between the two blocs on the court will more closely resemble the divide between the groups of Americans likely to gain, and lose, from the court\u2019s rulings themselves. The court\u2019s internal and external fault lines will more nearly converge. \u201cWe will have this very clear visual of a group of White people trying to rip away rights from Black and brown people while sitting across from Black and brown people with more qualifications than them,\u201d argues Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, a leading racial equity organization. \u201cIt will be the kind of images we have seen in our civil rights movies and seen in our civil rights books,\u201d he adds, the same sort of history \u201cthat their base is trying to ban\u201d through the multiplying red-state laws restricting how public school teachers can discuss current and historic racial discrimination. Just 51 years old, Jackson will likely spend decades at the center of the gathering conflict between the deeply conservative inclinations of the GOP-appointed justices and the preferences of a diversifying America, particularly the massive millennial and Generation Z cohorts born since 1980, which constitute the most racially and culturally diverse generations in American history. Some close observers are optimistic that the presence of the first Black female justice may change the court\u2019s internal dynamics in ways that moderate the majority\u2019s approach. The fact that we have other justices that appear to be diametrically opposed to her does not prevent them from listening to what she has to say. \u2026 I would like to believe that a woman with such impeccable credentials, with a wealth of experience, both life experience and judicial experience, is a voice that will resonate with all the justices no matter what political background they may represent. Janette McCarthy Wallace, the general counsel at the NAACP \u201cThe fact that we have other justices that appear to be diametrically opposed to her does not prevent them from listening to what she has to say,\u201d Janette McCarthy Wallace, the general counsel at the NAACP, told me. \u201cI can\u2019t say specifically about what they are going to do, but I would like to believe that a woman with such impeccable credentials, with a wealth of experience, both life experience and judicial experience, is a voice that will resonate with all the justices no matter what political background they may represent.\u201d Still, most advocates for liberal causes are bracing for the GOP-appointed majority to enable the broad drive underway in red states to retrench an array of previously guaranteed civil rights and liberties (such as voting, abortion and LGBTQ rights) while simultaneously constricting the federal government\u2019s ability to act through regulation or executive orders. Jackson, like the other Democratic appointees, is likely to spend years on the defensive as the court becomes a central \u2013 perhaps the central \u2013 arena for the struggle over control of the country\u2019s direction between the older predominantly White generations key to the GOP coalition and the younger non-White generations that constitute an increasing share of the Democratic electorate. \u201cIn terms of a progressive view of the world, what the Supreme Court is about to do is apocalyptic,\u201d predicts Paul Butler, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center. \u201cWe are about to see not just a judicial attack, but a judicial war.\u201d The six-member Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority may be only in the early stages of that campaign. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, its oldest members, are just 73 and 72, respectively; absent a health issue, that means this majority couldo remain the ultimate arbiter of the nation\u2019s laws for as much as another decade. In terms of a progressive view of the world, what the Supreme Court is about to do is apocalyptic. We are about to see not just a judicial attack, but a judicial war.\u201d Paul Butler, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center Over that same period, the nation will grow vastly more diverse on every possible dimension. The millennial generation, generally defined as those born between 1981 and 1996, was the most racially and culturally diverse generation in American history \u2013 at least until Generation Z, the young people born from 1996 until around 2014. Recent analysis has found that nearly half of Generation Z are kids of color, more than one-third consider themselves unaffiliated with any religious tradition and about one-fifth identity as LGBTQ. Young people born after 2014 will be the United States\u2019 first ever \u201cmajority minority\u201d generation, according to recent findings by Bill Frey, a demographer at Brookings Metro, a think tank. These younger justices will likely be the face of the Supreme Court in the upcoming decades These younger generations are inexorably supplanting the preponderantly White baby boom and older generations in American society. Frey has calculated that millennials and younger \u2013 the Americans born since 1980 \u2013 recently became the majority of the nation\u2019s population, a historic tipping point. Change, of course, comes more slowly to the electorate, but even there, the nonpartisan States of Change project has forecast that millennials and Generation Z will reach nearly 45% of eligible voters in 2024, exceeding baby boomers and older adults on that metric for the first time. At that point, millennials will represent the largest single generation in the electorate. (Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1980, will remain constant at about one-fourth of eligible voters, roughly their share since 2012.) The Supreme Court\u2019s docket is crowded with cases that threaten the priorities of those younger generations. In the latest CNN/SSRS national survey, for instance, more than three-fourths of younger adults said they supported legalized abortion, but the GOP-appointed majority appears ready, in a case involving a Mississippi law, to overturn Roe v. Wade and rescind or significantly retrench the 50-year-old nationwide right to the procedure. Also in this year\u2019s session, the majority is expected to severely restrict the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate carbon emissions \u2013 even as polls show younger generations expressing elevated concern about climate change. Abortion access under renewed threat in Oklahoma and Missouri More cases with stark generational implications are coming. For next year, the court has already agreed to hear cases on admissions policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina that could end the use of affirmative action. The court has also agreed to hear another case that could further restrict use of the Voting Rights Act to combat racial gerrymandering in the drawing of congressional districts \u2013 this comes after the GOP-appointed majority has issued repeated rulings over the past decade weakening the law in other ways. Also on tap for next year, at a time when more young people than ever are unaffiliated with any religious tradition, is a case that will again explore whether businesses can claim religious objections to serving same-sex couples. Beyond these cases, the court over the next few years will confront a succession of disputes over the ferocious push now underway in Republican-controlled states to roll back a broad array of civil rights and liberties. Since President Joe Biden\u2019s election, the 23 states where Republicans control both the state legislature and governorship have moved aggressively to restrict access to voting; to ban abortion; to bar transgender girls and women from participating in school sports and to prohibit medical professionals from providing gender-affirming care for minors, even when their parents support it; to censor how teachers can discuss race, gender and sexual orientation in the classroom; to make it easier for critics to ban books in school or even public libraries; and to increase criminal penalties for disruptive public protest. Opponents have already filed federal lawsuits against almost all of those policies, meaning that the Supreme Court may ultimately decide how many of them will stand. Even that doesn\u2019t represent the outer boundary of cultural disputes flowing toward the court. During Jackson\u2019s confirmation hearings, Republican senators suggested the court had erred in earlier rulings striking down state prohibitions against same-sex marriage (Sen. John Cornyn of Texas), the sale of contraception (Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee) and even interracial marriage (Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana). In particular, Cornyn\u2019s repeated likening of the court\u2019s 2015 Obergefell ruling creating a nationwide right to same-sex marriage to the notorious 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case authorizing racial segregation struck many observers as a virtual invitation for a red state to pass legislation testing whether the Supreme Court will reverse its 2015 decision. Butler says the court\u2019s GOP majority has already sent states a clear signal to test the boundaries on many fronts by refusing to block the Texas law allowing private lawsuits against those involved in providing abortions after early cardiac activity is detected, which can be as soon as six weeks into pregnancy. Because the Texas law \u201cis in open defiance of case law, I think the response that some people might have been expecting even from this court might have been, \u2018Oh, hell no, now you\u2019ve gone too far,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t the response of the court. The court is pretty much treating that case like any other case, and so it\u2019s an invitation for state lawmakers who are looking on to see what else they can get away with, and what else they can get the court to reconsider.\u201d In polling by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, Americans younger than 40 express views far more liberal than those of most Republicans \u2013 especially those who also identify as White evangelical Christians \u2013 on virtually every cultural and civil rights issue imaginable, from abortion to whether immigrants threaten or benefit American society to requiring transgender people to use the bathrooms of the sexes they were assigned at birth to whether police killings of black men are isolated incidents or part of a systemic pattern, according to previously unpublished results provided to CNN. On most of the cultural disputes it is deciding, the court majority \u201cis clearly going against the tide of general public opinion,\u201d especially among the young, says Robert P. Jones, the institute\u2019s founder and CEO. 'I turned off the TV': Law students on the pain and joy of KBJ's confirmation Jackson will now find herself in the center of all these disputes, probably for decades (though she has said she will recuse herself from the case involving Harvard because of her position on its board of overseers). But exactly how she will use that position remains to be seen. Many observers considered Breyer primarily an inside player who focused more on trying to moderate the opinions of his more conservative colleagues through quiet negotiation than on excoriating their decisions through sharp public dissents, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor has been more inclined to do. Many of Jackson\u2019s supporters see her as well suited for that role of internal diplomat. The NAACP\u2019s Wallace, for instance, says the \u201cvoice of a Black woman in the room\u201d could change the court\u2019s deliberations. \u201cOne thing that everyone has said about her \u2013 even those who may have been critical \u2013 is that this is a consensus builder and she builds relationships,\u201d she told me. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the court has become increasingly more conservative in its view, but I don\u2019t want to presume that any justice cannot be moved. I don\u2019t want to presume that her voice will be meaningless.\u201d Yet Butler is one of many court watchers who believe that opportunities to persuade two GOP-appointed justices to abandon the conservative majority will be very rare. More often, he says, the primary task for the Democratic-appointed justices will be to try to raise public awareness about the stakes of the majority\u2019s decisions through stinging dissents. In those cases, he says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to go hard. You are writing in part for history.\u201d What\u2019s clear already is that the conservative court majority has put itself on a trajectory for rising conflict with the racially and culturally diverse younger generations moving to adulthood. Like the red states passing new restrictions on abortion, voting, LGBTQ rights and classroom teaching, the court\u2019s rulings could have the effect of cementing into law the priorities and preferences of older White Christian conservatives \u2013 exactly as more diverse younger generations pass them to become the majority in American society. The GOP-appointed justices, argues Robinson, \u201care trying to take us back to a time when only certain people could participate in this democracy.\u201d In this twin-barreled offensive from conservatives in the states and on the court, Jones sees an echo of the campaign by Southern conservatives during the 1920s to build monuments to the confederacy just as the last of those who had fought the war died off. Now, as then, he argues, a passing generation is working to entrench its worldview by systematically erecting barriers against the competing perspectives gaining strength in younger generations. \u201cIt is literally about locking things in place,\u201d Jones told me. In each case, he says, the common goal for older conservatives is \u201cto imprint the culture and the community with our worldview in a way that is very hard to undo. We had that with the Daughters of the Confederacy in granite and bronze and we have that with the current GOP with (state) laws and Supreme Court rulings that might take a generation to undo.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama is urgently throwing himself into the fight against disinformation, taking a yearslong private fascination into the open as he makes addressing the issue a key pillar of his post-presidency. More than a decade after the false and infamous \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory was promulgated by his political opponents, including by the then-private citizen Donald Trump, Obama is hoping his personal experience with disinformation and his knowledge of its ramifications can help determine the best way to regulate social media platforms that promulgate disinformation and find ways to address what he calls the \u201cdemand for crazy on the internet\u201d that has filled a void as local news outlets have diminished. Obama\u2019s effort has been sweeping, say the former President\u2019s confidants and outside advisers with experience in the tech industry, with Obama convening meetings and conversations with academics, activists, researchers, tech sector leaders, media executives, former government officials and former regulators. People who have met with the former President describe him as gripped by the issue, showing up to meetings with handwritten notes and questions and often referring to reading he has done on the topic, including reports by the RAND Corporation and the Aspen Institute, and a research study on partisan media by David Broockman and Joshua Kalla. Eric Schultz, an Obama adviser, said the former President views disinformation as a \u201cthrough line for all of the challenges we face right now,\u201d including the pandemic, climate change and racial injustice. And for Obama, Schultz added, the \u201carc of this issue also tracks the arc of his public life\u201d \u2013 while social media helped get Obama elected in 2008, the misinformation that spread on different platforms also accelerated during his time in office. Obama: Ukraine war is a reminder of US complacency, taking democracy and 'rule of law' for granted Obama made this focus public on Wednesday when he headlined a conversation on disinformation at a conference sponsored by the University of Chicago\u2019s Institute of Politics and The Atlantic magazine. He will put a finer point on the topic later in the month when he delivers a keynote speech during a conference at Stanford University. \u201cIt is difficult for me to see how we win the contest of ideas if in fact we are not able to agree on a baseline of acts that allow the marketplace of ideas to work,\u201d Obama said Wednesday, lamenting that while attendees had access to all the information they wanted on their phones, there were still large swaths of Americans who believe that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump and that the coronavirus vaccine was not something they needed. Obama admitted that he \u201cgrappled with a lot\u201d during his presidency, including \u201cthe degree with which information, disinformation was being weaponized.\u201d But recalling his time in office, he said he and his staff \u201cunderestimated the degree to which democracies were as vulnerable to (disinformation) as they were, including ours.\u201d On baseless questions about where he was born, he said, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t an example of people being misinformed. There was an agenda behind that promotion of what was clearly a false fact.\u201d Obama told the audience Wednesday that he could \u201cdraw a direct line\u201d from his time on the campaign trail to the proliferation of lies about his place of birth and the falsehood that his signature health care law was establishing \u201cdeath panels\u201d for older Americans, as 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin had put it. \u201cThere was what has been called truth decay. There was an erosion of what was considered acceptable to assert in the press, period. That is all pre-social media,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then when social media hits, then I think you saw it spread and accelerate. \u2026 I think it was actually in my second term that you start to see now just bad information, but you also start to see an acceleration of misinformation.\u201d \u201cAnd by 2016, that is when, well, we know what happened,\u201d Obama said, trailing off, acknowledging what everyone in the room knew \u2013 the same man who pushed the birther conspiracy theory was elected as his successor. Obama argued that he views disinformation as \u201centirely different from information that is inconvenient,\u201d pointing to his \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep it\u201d falsehood during the fight over his sweeping health care law \u2013 which earned him the Politifact \u201cLie of the Year\u201d in 2013 \u2013 as an example of the latter. Although Obama defended the intention behind the line, he said he \u201ccouldn\u2019t really complain about people criticizing me for it\u201d and said it was different than recent lies about the 2020 election because him saying it was \u201cnot a threat to democracy\u201d and \u201cwas not intended to somehow subvert the Democratic process.\u201d \u201cIn a democracy there are going to be, in the normal course of debate, we will contest what has been said, what has been proposed, what has been delivered and there will be some play in the joints of how we interpret stuff,\u201d Obama said, adding that lies about the election and other issues went far beyond that. Obama, now a 60-year-old, gray haired former politician, has fully embraced the technological intricacies of the disinformation issue, according to an outside adviser who has worked in the tech industry, mostly because the former President is \u201cnaturally kind of a geek.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not as though it\u2019s like this is some new-fangled, whatchamacallit that you will never see on my lawn or whatever,\u201d the adviser told CNN. \u201cHe understands this world.\u201d 'Like the good old days': Obama returns to the White House for the first time as Democrats look ahead to midterm elections The adviser said Obama has more time to focus on the issue because \u201cnow he has the ability to talk to a range of experts without it being an official function of government,\u201d and so he has convened a range of people to look at the problem. And that has given him, this person said, not just a better understanding of the way disinformation has personally affected his life and career but also a deep concern that the spread of disinformation will lead to a form of \u201cpolitical nihilism,\u201d where many Americans don\u2019t know what to believe and just check out from politics all together. \u201cThat is the real nemesis and the real environment that disinformation creates and allows autocracy to flourish,\u201d the outside adviser said. \u201cBirtherism is obviously a part of that story, but the stakes have, in some ways, changed so dramatically since then, that it\u2019s become part of the context of democracy itself.\u201d In retrospect, \u201cbirtherism\u201d, or the belief that Obama was not born in Hawaii, was a warning of what was to come, the dark and dystopian route American political discourse was about to take. \u201cBirtherism\u201d and the \u201cBig Lie\u201d undermining the 2020 election are not at all dissimilar. Both are viral baseless conspiracy theories, with prejudicial undertones, championed by Trump to engage an enthusiastic base and to sow seeds of doubt in the wider population. The birther conspiracy theory first emerged sometime during the first decade of the century \u2013 Obama said it had been pushed as early as his Senate race in Illinois. It\u2019s precise genesis is unclear and disputed. Come 2011, however, Trump had become a standard-bearer of the birther movement, launching a campaign for Obama to release his long-form birth certificate. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a birth certificate. He may have one, but there\u2019s something on that, maybe religion, maybe it says he is a Muslim,\u201d Trump told Fox in 2011. Obama did have a long-form birth certificate, and the White House released it. Obama later went on to roast Trump at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association dinner that year. Lee Foster, an expert in tracking disinformation and senior vice president at Alethea Group, told CNN that the birther conspiracy theory was \u201cmerely a precursor to the barrage of falsehoods we find ourselves facing in today\u2019s political environment.\u201d Foster, who has been involved in exposing foreign disinformation campaigns targeting the United States through social media, said that it is important to remember that this goes beyond the internet. Why Ukraine war misinformation is so hard to police \u201cBig Tech plays a role in this, but so do our media institutions, our political parties and, frankly, all of us. It requires all of us to tackle,\u201d he said. Despite Obama\u2019s keen interest, answers about the best way to counter disinformation have proved more elusive. During his remarks Wednesday, Obama alluded to the need for transparency about social media algorithms that determine what people see in their online feeds and the issue of anonymity on social media sites. He said also expressed support for toughening regulations on social media companies. He said that while he is not for \u201centirely eliminating\u201d Section 230, a rule that protects the companies\u2019 ability to moderate content on their site as they see fit, he questioned whether the protections were fair for \u201cpaid advertising that is microtargeting certain groups. \u2026 That can be really damaging.\u201d And Obama somewhat mockingly responded to protests from social media companies, who say their algorithms and product design contain proprietary information that can\u2019t be shown to regulators or the public. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly how the inspections on meat are done. And if somebody says we have a proprietary technique to keep our meat clean, that\u2019s fine, take it up with the meat inspector,\u201d he said sarcastically. \u201cThis notion that we have to preserve this because somehow we have proprietary interests, that is wrong.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s shattering of a racial glass ceiling, in a week also marked by the naked ambition of the Republicans who smeared her, the delusional demagoguery of an ex-President and a touch of the bizarre, reflected an historic and extreme Washington age. Like everyone else, those in the nation\u2019s capital will never forget the wrenching horror of images depicting atrocities perpetrated by Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s troops against defenseless Ukrainian civilians. Yet Washington\u2019s self-absorption, and spot at the confluence of the profound and opposing political forces rocking the United States, meant that life went on as normal in the nation\u2019s capital, in all its polarized and often absurd glory. Most importantly, there was history. Jackson will be the first Black woman to serve on the Supreme Court. Her Senate confirmation on Thursday repaired a prejudicial omission more than 200 years in the making. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken another step toward making our highest court reflect the diversity of America,\u201d President Joe Biden said in an Instagram post that might become its own curiosity of history years into the future since he snapped a selfie of himself and Jackson after the vote. Yet an occasion as normal \u2013 and constitutionally foreseen \u2013 as the confirmation of a future Supreme Court associate justice also came with the bitter taste of the partisanship that threatens to tear America apart. Michelle Obama: Ketanji Brown Jackson gives Black women and girls 'a new dream to dream' The top Senate Republican, Mitch McConnell, who forged the safe conservative control on the high court by blocking a Democratic nominee in an election year and rushing a Republican one through in similar circumstances, refused to say whether he\u2019d confirm another Biden pick if the GOP wins the chamber back in November. One of McConnell\u2019s lieutenants, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, admitted to the possibility that hyperpartisanship would again thwart yet another constitutional norm \u2013 that a President gets votes on his judicial nominees. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be hard,\u201d Thune told CNN. \u201cBecause that\u2019s kind of the environment we\u2019re in right now.\u201d That \u201cenvironment\u201d was amply demonstrated by Thune\u2019s colleagues during Jackson\u2019s confirmation process. While praising her intellect and family \u2013 apparently to avoid being seen as showing disrespect to a historic racial pioneer \u2013 they falsely branded her as an enabler of child sex offenders even though her sentencing record was well within the mainstream. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton even claimed she would have been lenient toward Nazi war criminals. Cotton, Sen Ted Cruz of Texas and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley all clearly had an eye on future presidential campaign ads with their histrionic attacks on her judicial record. Jackson adds to the Supreme Court Generation X bloc At times like these, it\u2019s notable when Washington agrees on anything. But the Senate unanimously passed two bills to punish Russia for invading Ukraine. The House voted 420-3 and 413-9 to do the same. Only three representatives, Republicans Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Matt Gaetz of Florida \u2013 fervent Donald Trump supporters \u2013 voted against both bills. It might seem a no-brainer to condemn an invasion that has caused some of the most heinous atrocities in Europe since World War II. Yet the hangover of the ex-President\u2019s hero worship for Putin \u2013 and the reason why some European leaders fear a second Trump term \u2013 was in evidence earlier this week when 63 House members voted against a boilerplate bill expressing support for NATO. The investigations into Donald Trump aren't going away Another aspect of Trump\u2019s legacy that still haunts Capitol Hill is his incitement of the terrifying assault by his supporters on January 6, 2021, designed to thwart the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s free and fair election victory the previous November. In an interview with The Washington Post from his political exile in Mar-a-Lago, the ex-President said the Secret Service didn\u2019t allow him to march to the Capitol on that day with his supporters. And he repeatedly blamed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the violence, even though she is not responsible for security at the Capitol \u2013 or the Trump supporters who stormed it. Trump also expanded on the flagrant lies about a stolen election, which are intensifying his threat to democracy since millions of his supporters believe them. In an extraordinary comment, which raised questions about Trump\u2019s grip on reality, he expressed surprise that he had not been reinstated as President because of \u201cmassive election fraud.\u201d \u201cHow has it not happened? If you are a bank robber, or you\u2019re a jewelry store robber, and you go into Tiffany\u2019s and you steal their diamonds and get caught, you have to give the diamonds back,\u201d he told the Post. Trump\u2019s own attorney general, William Barr, rejected his false claims about a stolen election. And multiple courts threw out his flurry of spurious cases on the grounds they contained no evidence of electoral irregularities. The House select committee investigating the insurrection, and Trump\u2019s role in it, is racing against time because if Republicans win the House in November\u2019s midterm elections, they are almost certain to shut it down. Such is the altered reality of Washington in the post-Trump age that recent virtual testimony by the daughter and son-in-law of a President who mounted a coup attempt didn\u2019t cause that much of a stir. But news that the Justice Department is investigating the handling of White House records \u2013 including classified material \u2013 taken to Mar-a-Lago by the Trump team underscored the dark shadow of the ex-President\u2019s legacy. As did a request by New York\u2019s attorney general, Letitia James, for Trump to be held in contempt of court for allegedly refusing to comply with an order to hand over documents in her civil investigation of his firm\u2019s business practices. Those Americans who disdain Washington often cite what they see as an overly cozy relationship between politicians and the journalists who cover them. The idea was at the core of Trump\u2019s rants about the \u201cWashington swamp.\u201d Such perceptions will be hardly be improved by more than a dozen positive Covid-19 tests coming out of one of the most insidery Washington events \u2013 the closed-door Gridiron dinner last weekend. Those who were at the big night out and tested positive include Attorney General Merrick Garland and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo. And in another sign that Covid is sweeping through the capital, Pelosi\u2019s office said Thursday that the House speaker has also tested positive. The 82-year-old is currently asymptomatic and is fully vaccinated and boosted. Her case will renew concern about the virus getting closer to Biden, following a flurry of cases among White House staff. Pelosi was with the President as recently as Wednesday for a bill signing and stood at his right elbow. But the White House said Pelosi wasn\u2019t considered a close contact of the President because their encounter was fleeting. The commander in chief, who has had his second booster, tested negative Wednesday night. Two of the oddest recent stories to rattle the capital put a capstone on an often strange week. In an extraordinary case, the FBI arrested two men in Washington for allegedly impersonating Department of Homeland Security agents for more than two years. The men allegedly gave expensive gifts to real federal agents, including apartment leases, surveillance systems, a drone, a flat-screen TV and a generator. In another twist, one of the defendants is alleged to have offered to buy a weapon for a Secret Service agent assigned to protect first lady Jill Biden. This all only came to light after the two men were interviewed as witnesses by a US postal inspector investigating an alleged assault on a mail deliverer. There were no immediate details on the motives for this extraordinary scheme. Another sinister distraction occurred when a fox that later tested positive for rabies struck fear into the hearts of those who work on Capitol Hill. A congressman and a journalist were among those who reported being nipped before it was captured by animal control workers and euthanized. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I survived three years of a pandemic to be bit by a rabid fox,\u201d Ximena Bustillo, a Politico reporter, wrote on Twitter. This is no laughing matter, given the deadly nature of the disease and the shots anyone who is bitten has to endure to ward off infection. But in times like these, a rabid fox spreading terror in the citadel of US democracy is the kind of Washington metaphor that writes itself.",

            "article_content": "The escalating red-state efforts to ban more books mark a new stage in the struggle to control the educational experience of America\u2019s kaleidoscopically diverse younger generations. Since 2021, more than a dozen Republican-controlled states have passed laws or approved executive branch policies that restrict how public school teachers can talk about race, gender and sexual orientation, as in the case of the bill critics call \u201cdon\u2019t say gay,\u201d which Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law last week. But now, even as National Library Week arrives this week, the attempt to limit what materials are available to young people is spilling out from the classroom into the library. Though battles over access to controversial titles traditionally have been fought district by district, and even school by school, Republican-controlled states including Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas are now pushing statewide rules that make it easier for critics to remove books they dislike from school libraries in every community. Books about LGBTQ and Black people were among those most challenged in 2021 At the same time, although none have yet passed, more red states are seriously debating proposals that would make it easier for critics to force the removal of books even from public libraries serving the adult population. \u201cThe primary target still is school libraries and school librarians, K-12 teachers, but we are seeing this bleed over to public libraries,\u201d says Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association. To the conservatives pushing this agenda, these new restrictions on libraries \u2013 like the parallel red-state laws limiting certain discussions in the classroom \u2013 are a means of protecting parental rights. \u201cParents want education for their kids: They are not interested in indoctrination through the school system,\u201d DeSantis argued late last month when signing a bill facilitating efforts to remove books from school libraries. But to a wide array of civil rights, civil liberties and free expression groups, these restrictions represent an effort to enshrine the values of one particular group of parents \u2013 conservative Whites \u2013 over the priorities and experiences of an increasingly diverse society in which kids of color now compose a clear majority of the public school student body nationwide. There is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information. Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project The parallel battles over how teachers address race, gender and sexual orientation and how libraries regulate access to books represent the broadest attempt to limit what students are taught since the \u201cloyalty oath\u201d demands on teachers during the red scare period of the 1950s, or even the \u201cScopes trial\u201d-era laws banning the teaching of evolution during the 1920s. \u201cThere is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information,\u201d says Vera Eidelman a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. On both fronts, she says, critics are \u201ctargeting the same set of viewpoints and experiences and aspects of education,\u201d primarily materials relating to race, gender roles and the experiences of LGBTQ individuals. The torrent of laws approved in Republican-controlled states since 2021 to limit how teachers can discuss race, gender or sexual orientation has been part of a much broader current. Since the 2020 election, the 23 states in which Republicans control both the governorship and the state legislature have approved a surge of statutes restricting abortion rights, making it more difficult to vote, barring transgender girls and women from participating in grade school or college sports, banning transgender care for minors and increasing penalties for public protest. Cumulatively, as I\u2019ve written, these proliferating red-state measures constitute an attempt to reverse what legal analysts call the \u201crights revolution\u201d of roughly the past 60 years, in which Congress and the Supreme Court have generally expanded the circle of basic civil rights and liberties guaranteed to all Americans and reduced the ability of states to curtail those rights. Critics of the new wave of red-state measures see an especially powerful through line connecting the laws that make it more difficult to vote and increase the legal penalties for disruptive public protest with the bills that censor classroom instruction or empower critics to ban books in school libraries. All three thrusts make it more difficult for opponents to mobilize opposition to the agenda the red-state Republicans are advancing. How a diverse coalition in a red state shut down anti-CRT legislation \u201cThere are parallel movements across voting rights and protest rights and education rights,\u201d says Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors. \u201cIn each case, you have a kind of flowering of experimentation of legislation to see what kind of things can fit to make it harder for people to vote, to make it more costly to protest and what would make it harder to access information in school.\u201d The restrictions on classroom teaching have exploded across the red states since 2021. Jeffrey Sachs, a political scientist at Acadia University in Nova Scotia who tracks these proposals for PEN America, counts at least 13 Republican-controlled states that have approved laws censoring how teachers talk about \u201cdivisive concepts,\u201d such as systematic racial inequity, and five more states with GOP governors that have imposed administrative limits on such teachings through state boards of education or other bodies. The conservatives pushing these bills portray them as a necessary barrier against liberal attempts to \u201cindoctrinate\u201d students through concepts such as critical race theory, an academic analysis of systemic discrimination, or the 1619 Project, a New York Times project that stressed the impact of slavery on American society. At a recent event with DeSantis, Alicia Farrant, a mother and school board candidate in Orange County, Florida, described her state\u2019s version of these proposals as proof that parents \u201cwill not cower to the divisive agendas that are infiltrating our public schools in order to corrupt and destroy the educational foundations of our great nation.\u201d This wave does not appear to have crested. The Florida legislation barring discussion of sexual orientation in the youngest grades and limiting it in older grades has spawned copycat bills in other Republican-controlled states. More states are also considering laws that would extend the classroom censorship to public colleges and universities. Other GOP-controlled states, including Missouri, are considering their own bills on race and gender, and some of the states that have already passed such laws are doubling back with new proposals \u2013 such as a proposed amendment to the state constitution in Arizona to ban the teaching of critical race theory. \u201cThe level of focus and unity of language that we are seeing across all of these different bills is pretty extraordinary,\u201d Sachs says. \u201cThere is an incredible amount of overlap, down to the punctuation of these bills, so we can definitely consider this a national campaign and not one that is responding to the specific context of each state.\u201d This campaign has developed so much momentum that it has overflowed the classroom to reach the library \u2013 particularly those in schools, but now also, for the first time, lapping at the doors of those that serve the public. In recent decades, these fights have unfolded mostly locally, with challenges to specific books at individual libraries. Those fights are clearly intensifying: On Monday, the American Library Association reported that in 2021 it had recorded 729 such efforts to ban books at school or public libraries, the most since it began cataloging these efforts in 2000. The most-challenged books, the group reported, were from Black or LGBTQ authors or centered on characters from those communities. The news out of Florida and Texas exemplifies a larger conservative trend But this struggle is also expanding to a new level, with multiplying red-state efforts to create statewide policies designed to lead to the removal of more books. In Texas, for instance, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is pressuring school boards to remove what he calls \u201cpornography\u201d from school libraries. Abbott\u2019s letter followed a more detailed complaint from a Republican state legislator who sent districts a letter inquiring about the presence of 850 books, including several by prominent Black or LGBTQ authors. In Florida, DeSantis signed a bill late last month that requires school libraries to post more information about their collections and seek community input on materials they acquire. Most importantly, the new law requires the state Department of Education to collect and publish a report on which books have been removed in any district across the state. At the bill-signing ceremony, DeSantis said these provisions would ensure that students are exposed only to age-appropriate books. The new measures will increase schools\u2019 \u201cability to choose what is appropriate for different age groups,\u201d he argued. \u201cParents are going to have the ability to have their voices heard.\u201d But opponents of the legislation say the requirement for the state Education Department to publish a list of books removed in any district provides a road map for critics to demand the removal of such books in all districts. Florida, as is the case with many of the cultural flashpoints now dominating red-state legislatures, has moved fastest and furthest. But Georgia\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature last week passed its own bill facilitating challenges to books in school libraries; measures targeting school libraries have also passed one chamber in the GOP-controlled legislatures in Kansas and Tennessee, though they face uncertain prospects of final approval. Similarly motivated bills have surfaced in Nebraska and Oklahoma as well. In another escalation to the book wars, red state proposals are now emerging to ease the removal of books even in public libraries serving the adult, as well as the youth, population. These proposals generally would strip away the protection for librarians (and educators) from state obscenity laws, allowing officials to criminally charge librarians if they stock materials that a prosecutor considers obscene. We all live in diverse communities these days \u2026 and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone\u2019s lives in the library collection. Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association Republican legislators have introduced bills to eliminate those protections in more than half a dozen states, according to the American Library Association\u2019s tracking. None have yet passed into law, though one has cleared the state House in Idaho. Yet given the pace at which ideas once on the fringe, such as bans on gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, are advancing through the red states, Caldwell-Stone says the library association is \u201cdeeply concerned that one of these bills will eventually pass and will be used as a means of both intimidating librarians or actually charging them with crimes \u2013 based on this falsehood that mainstream materials, published by mainstream publishers, are somehow illegal speech unprotected by the First Amendment.\u201d Last fall, a library faced such an investigation in Campbell County, Wyoming, after a local church complained about the presence of LGBTQ and sexual education materials there; a special prosecutor appointed by the county ultimately decided not to press charges. All these confrontations underscore the cultural chasm between increasingly diverse younger generations and the socially conservative, predominantly White and Christian, Republican coalition that holds power in the red states. Children of color have constituted a majority of the public school K-12 student body since 2014, according to federal statistics, and now make up nearly 55% of the total. Gallup recently reported that 1 in 5 members of Generation Z, as well as 1 in 10 millennials, identify as LGBTQ, far more than in older generations. And the Public Religion Research Institute has found that more than a third of young adults identify as secular, without affiliation with any organized religion. Supporters of the efforts to restrict classroom teaching and/or ban books, by contrast, often cite a threat to \u201ctraditional\u201d morality as a justification. When DeSantis signed the bill easing challenges to school library collections, one of the speakers he brought to the podium was a mother who had been prominent in protests against school masking requirements in Volusia County. She said her concern about school libraries was prompted in part by a picture book called \u201cRed: A Crayon\u2019s Story,\u201d in which a crayon labeled red discovers that it\u2019s really blue. The mother, Rebecca Sarwi, said she objected to \u201csubliminal messaging for kids that young\u201d that \u201cnormalizes them to believe\u201d that they may be \u201csomething other than the unique individual that God created them to be.\u201d Such arguments highlight what may be the core issue in this intensifying dispute: Though the classroom and library restrictions are being portrayed as an effort to strengthen \u201cparents\u2019 rights,\u201d in practice they mean giving one set of parents a veto over educational content not only for their own kids, but others\u2019 as well. Librarians \u201cdon\u2019t disagree with parents who want to guide their children\u2019s readings \u2026 but they stand firmly opposed to one family dictating what is available to everyone else in a school library or a public library,\u201d Caldwell-Stone told me. \u201cWe all live in diverse communities these days \u2026 and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone\u2019s lives in the library collection.\u201d Polls have generally found broad skepticism about the new classroom and library restrictions. A recent CBS survey found that more than four-fifths of Americans opposed banning books because they criticized American history or discussed race. A recent Grinnell College national poll found more than 70% of Americans trusted school officials to decide what materials were appropriate for their libraries. In a recent CNN poll, only about 1 in 6 adults thought parents should have the principal say on how race is taught in schools. One element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world. Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America Opponents of the restrictive measures are trying to organize greater resistance to them. Red Wine and Blue, a nationwide group of suburban Democratic-leaning women fighting the red-state proposals, has organized a nationwide \u201cread-in\u201d of banned books on Thursday hosted by Dolly Parton\u2019s sister Stella that features the authors of targeted books such as \u201cI Am Rosa Parks\u201d and \u201cHeather Has Two Mommies.\u201d That same day, a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee is holding a hearing on the book ban efforts, which could signal a turn toward greater attention to the issue from national Democrats. \u201cAfter a long time of banging my head on the kitchen counter, I do feel like there\u2019s progress and we are seeing some results,\u201d says Katie Paris, Red Wine and Blue\u2019s founder. Paris says thousands of women have gone through the group\u2019s training, which is designed to counter the organizing of the conservative organizations supporting the restrictions, such as Moms for Liberty. Though the number of proposed book bans continues to rise, Paris says, a smaller share of them have been approved in recent months by districts or school administrators, according to the group\u2019s figures. In several cases, others note, students themselves are taking a more visible role in opposing these measures \u2013 as in the widespread walkouts in Florida against the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill and a lawsuit brought by Missouri students against a book ban in their school. \u201cOne element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students,\u201d says Friedman. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world.\u201d Still, even with occasional setbacks, the drive to control the flow of information to young people is demonstrating enormous energy in red states. With Congress unlikely to pass any national legislation combating this trend, opponents\u2019 best chance to slow the tide are legal challenges, some of which are already working through the courts. In the 1982 Pico decision upholding the First Amendment rights of students, the Supreme Court ruled, as the ACLU\u2019s Eidelman puts it, \u201cschools cannot remove books from their shelves merely because they disagree with the ideas expressed in those books.\u201d Yet many observers note it\u2019s unclear whether this more conservative Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority would uphold that standard. What is clear is that more of the red states appear intent on testing the boundaries of what the Supreme Court will allow through new laws facilitating the banning of books from school, or potentially even public, libraries. \u201cThis is one of the key characteristics of the era in which we live,\u201d says Paris. \u201cI think we\u2019ve had to learn there are no bounds. That is what makes this a fight for democracy. This isn\u2019t just a culture war sideshow.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Before this week, Judge David Carter was known as an unconventional, action-oriented federal judge and an advocate for California\u2019s homeless population \u2013 or for helming the Anna Nicole Smith lawsuit. Carter made headlines Monday when he said that former President Donald Trump and attorney John Eastman may have been planning a crime as they sought to disrupt the congressional certification of the presidential election on January 6. \u201cBased on the evidence, the Court finds it more likely than not that President Trump corruptly attempted to obstruct the Joint Session of Congress on January 6, 2021,\u201d Carter wrote on Monday. Judge: 'More likely than not' that Trump 'corruptly attempted' to block Congress from counting votes on January 6 Carter does not have the ability to prosecute Trump, but his reasoning is an acknowledgment by a federal court that Trump\u2019s interest in overturning the election could be considered criminal. The Southern California federal judge is a Marine and attended UCLA for his undergraduate and law school studies. He was nominated to the federal bench by former President Bill Clinton in 1998, according to Ballotpedia. Carter also previously ran as a Democrat to represent California\u2019s 38th Congressional District, but his efforts were unsuccessful, according to the Los Angeles Times. Perhaps until Monday, Carter\u2019s most famous national ruling was against the late Anna Nicole Smith as she attempted to sanction her late husband\u2019s estate for millions. The judge\u2019s unorthodox methods were on high display when he drew ire from the American Civil Liberties Union in 1990 for duct-taping the mouths of defendants in his courtroom. According to an LA Times article from the time, he \u201cbegan ordering his bailiff to wrap duct tape around the mouths of defendants who used profanity or spit at court personnel.\u201d Stepping out from behind the bench, Carter utilized a hands on approach in 2018, and walked the homeless encampments in Orange County and spoke with its residents when presiding over a case on evictions. Last year, Carter ordered the county and city of Los Angeles to provide shelter for the homeless on Skid Row. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, this time with a mask, the judge once again went to see and interact with the population whom his verdict would impact. Carter cited structural racism in his ruling: \u201cWhen state inaction has become so egregious, and the state so nonfunctional, as to create a death rate for Black people so disproportionate to their racial composition in the general population, the Court can only reach one conclusion \u2013 state inaction has become state action that is strongly likely in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d An appeals court later vacated Carter\u2019s ruling saying that the district court \u201cabused it\u2019s discretion.\u201d",

            "article_content": "During the confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson to become the next US Supreme Court justice, many Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee wasted no time embracing the kind of bad-faith scrutiny often reserved for women and Black nominees \u2013 beneficiaries of affirmative action, in one GOP senator\u2019s parlance. Some Republicans, lacking a coherent strategy, pressed Jackson for her views on The 1619 Project and the children\u2019s book \u201cAntiracist Baby\u201d (because \u201ccritical race theory\u201d), though neither has anything to do with the job she\u2019s being considered for. And others tried with great effort to cast the nominee as weak on crime by distorting her past work defending Guantanamo Bay detainees and her sentencing in child pornography cases. This wafer-thin opposition was revealing. To use an observation from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, the attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday were nothing more than \u201cstraw men, worn talking points and imagined grievances\u201d that demonstrated that Republicans didn\u2019t have any real criticism of Jackson, whom the American Bar Association rated \u201cwell qualified\u201d to serve on the court. All GOP senators had were tired complaints designed to animate their base. Some Republicans this week seemed determined to deflect attention from Jackson\u2019s record. Take Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. He spent several minutes of his questioning time on Tuesday not talking about Jackson but instead impugning Nikole Hannah-Jones, a New York Times Magazine writer and the creator of The 1619 Project, which has become a lightning rod for the anger of the political right. Then, he leaped to CRT and rifled through children\u2019s books that he said promote the law school framework. \u201cDo you agree with this book (\u2018Antiracist Baby\u2019) that is being taught to kids that babies are racist?\u201d Cruz asked. Jackson refused to spar over racist babies and insisted on discussing legal matters. \u201cSenator, I have not reviewed any of those books, any of those ideas,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t come up in my work as a judge, which I\u2019m respectfully here to address.\u201d Later that day, Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee revisited CRT, saying that Jackson ought to give parents the right to prohibit the concept from being taught in public school classrooms. \u201cIt is important to them to have a Supreme Court that is going to protect parental rights to teach these children as parents see fit to have their children taught,\u201d Blackburn said. In some ways, avoiding conversations about anything relevant to Jackson or her record seemed to be the point on Tuesday and Wednesday. \u201cIn lieu of taking Jackson\u2019s sterling record seriously, opponents have opted for deflection,\u201d Slate\u2019s Dahlia Lithwick recently wrote. \u201cThey don\u2019t like court expansion. They don\u2019t like the Sentencing Commission. They don\u2019t like lawyers who defended detainees at Guantanamo Bay. But these aren\u2019t actually complaints about Jackson or her qualifications. They\u2019re rehashed boilerplate complaints about all Democrats.\u201d For weeks, Republicans have seemed uninterested in engaging with Jackson\u2019s record. Presumably, that\u2019s because they know that their attacks hold no merit and that there\u2019s little they can do to thwart her from being confirmed. So, they used the hearings to prepare for something much less settled: the midterm election cycle. When they weren\u2019t preoccupied with Democrats\u2019 treatment of Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 who four years ago was accused of sexual assault before he was confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the country\u2019s highest court \u2013 Republicans this week were obsessed with trying to portray Jackson as \u201csoft on crime.\u201d For instance, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. John Cornyn of Texas expressed concerns over the nominee\u2019s advocacy for Guantanamo Bay detainees while she served as a federal public defender and worked at a private law firm. Graham went so far as to claim that Jackson\u2019s advocacy jeopardized national security. \u201cI\u2019m suggesting the system has failed miserably and advocates to change the system like she was advocating would destroy our ability to protect our country,\u201d Graham said on Tuesday, before theatrically leaving the room. Yet what such criticism downplayed was the fact that Jackson was merely following the Constitution that Republicans enjoy showering with pious praise. \u201cShe was meeting a minimal constitutional requirement: providing defense to those who are in the criminal justice system and who are unable to afford defense,\u201d Melissa Murray, a professor at New York University School of Law, told CNN. \u201cTo me, that suggests fidelity to the rule of law, not necessarily soft on crime.\u201d Alicia Bannon, the director of the judiciary program at the Brennan Center for Justice, underscored the importance of Jackson\u2019s unique professional background. \u201cJackson would be the first justice, ever, to have experience as a public defender,\u201d Bannon told CNN. \u201cShe\u2019d be the first justice since Thurgood Marshall, who left the court more than 30 years ago, to have substantial experience representing poor criminal defendants. And that\u2019s a critical perspective that\u2019s long been absent from the judiciary overall and especially from the US Supreme Court.\u201d Notably, Marshall faced similarly dishonest scrutiny during his confirmation hearings in 1967, when a group of Southern senators tried to attach the civil rights leader to the specter of crime during a season of racial unrest. \u201cI know there is a crisis in this country, a crime crisis,\u201d Sen. John McClellan of Arkansas said at the time. \u201cI know the philosophy of the Supreme Court one way or the other on these vital issues is going to be of untold consequences, and has already been in my judgment of serious consequences to the crime situation.\u201d Republicans, including Cruz and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, also sought to misrepresent Jackson\u2019s record by charging that, as a jurist, she was too lenient in child pornography cases. Jackson refuted the already-debunked accusation that she under-sentenced in child pornography cases \u2013 a thorough CNN review found that she largely hewed to the common judicial sentencing practices in these kinds of cases \u2013 and meticulously laid out her approach to an issue that she described as a \u201csickening and egregious crime.\u201d \u201cThe judge is looking at all of these different factors and making a determination in every case, based on a number of different considerations,\u201d Jackson said on Tuesday. \u201cAnd in every case, I did my duty to hold the defendants accountable in light of the evidence and the information that was presented to me.\u201d Cruz and Hawley\u2019s actions were particularly disturbing for their potential to energize the conservative fringes. As Vox\u2019s Ian Millhiser put the situation earlier this week, \u201cRepublicans are tapping into the ugliest ideas that exist in American society. They\u2019re throwing around allegations that rely on distorted versions of someone\u2019s actions. And they\u2019re doing so in the hopes of derailing the nomination of a judge with an entirely mainstream record.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Washington Republicans are privately resigned to the likelihood that Supreme Court nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson will be confirmed by the Senate. But even if Republican senators don\u2019t expect to block Jackson, the four-day televised hearing is still a proving ground for a number of potential GOP presidential candidates. Several Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee with White House ambitions have the opportunity to make a splash this week as they question Jackson: Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Tom Cotton of Arkansas. Their model is the 2018 hearing for Brett Kavanaugh, when three future Democratic presidential candidates \u2013 Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker \u2013 delivered their own high-profile performances. Unlike with the Kavanaugh nomination, Jackson has generated very little controversy. Her opponents have focused as much on their complaints about past judicial nomination fights as on Jackson\u2019s record. But the opportunity to question Jackson is nonetheless a chance for White House hopefuls to demonstrate their political mettle. How Ketanji Brown Jackson will fit in on the Supreme Court The hearings so far have provided a look into how these four Republican senators who may run in 2024 are positioning themselves ahead of a primary. Their opponents could include not only each other but former President Donald Trump, the Republican who has singularly shaped the party for the past half decade. In their statements and questions to Jackson, each of these Republicans have demonstrated their own interpretations about how to address issues such as the courts, the role of government and race in the current iteration of the GOP. As a reliable avatar for grassroots conservative sentiment, Cruz has used his Judiciary Committee perch to lean into familiar culture war issues and disparage liberals, playing a role Republican primary voters have come to expect from the Texan. GOP questions reveal the bad-faith scrutiny reserved for Black nominees Cruz spent his opening statement on Monday criticizing Democrats and the news media. And on Tuesday, his line of questioning to Jackson began with issues surrounding race and education \u2013 culture war touchstones that had little to do with her judicial philosophy. Indeed, Jackson responded to several questions from Cruz about her views of both The New York Times\u2019 1619 Project and critical race theory by saying the issues do not come up in her work on the federal bench. But Cruz made sure to let viewers know his own views on those subjects: He noted he finds the 1619 Project \u201cdeeply inaccurate and misleading\u201d and disparaged certain books found in schools that he says teach children incorrect ideas about racism. How public education should address America\u2019s racial history has emerged as an hot-button topic in recent election cycles, including in last year\u2019s Virginia gubernatorial race. Republicans see their opposition to more progressive readings of American history as a winning issue. And Cruz\u2019s attempt to draw out Jackson into a debate about this topic reflects its power with the conservative grassroots that make up his base. As much as Cruz is a quintessential firebrand, Sasse presented himself as a sober conservative, critical of both parties and the three branches of government for failing to live up to their responsibilities. A frequent critic of Trump before, during and after his presidency, Sasse has given voice to a conservative critique of the lack of civic virtue. \u201cMany years of corroding our constitutional order have contributed to the polarization and the viciousness that are poisoning our politics more broadly,\u201d Sasse said in his opening remarks Monday. \u201cWe all know that our civic health and our civic life is not healthy.\u201d Ketanji Brown Jackson hearing: 5 takeaways from Wednesday More content to let the conversation with Jackson carry on at length than to deliver flashy soundbites, Sasse has tended toward focusing his remarks on academic questions of Jackson\u2019s judicial philosophy. That has allowed the Nebraska Republican to make known his views on the proper role of the judiciary. \u201cThroughout this process, we should all remember that a Supreme Court justice is not a lawmaker by another name. A Supreme Court justice performs a crucial but limited function in our political system, namely to interpret and fairly apply the text of the law as written and as understood at the time it was adopted,\u201d he said on Monday. Unlike other Republicans on the panel, Sasse failed to get combative with Jackson \u2013 in-character with his kinder, gentler approach to drawing distinctions with liberals. It remains to be seen whether there is a market for that in a Republican primary electorate that rewarded Trump for doing the opposite in 2016. Among the GOP members of the committee, Hawley did the most beforehand to telegraph his likely line of inquiry \u2013 distinguishing himself early as a senator worth watching and setting the tone for other Republicans on the committee. In the days before Jackson\u2019s hearing began, Hawley expressed concerns about her writings, remarks and decisions around the sensitive issue of child pornography crimes. On Twitter, Hawley accused Jackson of having \u201ca pattern of letting child porn offenders off the hook for their appalling crimes.\u201d From Bork to Kavanaugh, GOP grievances feature during Jackson hearing Hawley has iterated seven cases Jackson had heard as a trial judge in which she delivered lighter sentences than recommended by prosecutors for people convicted of consuming child pornography. But Jackson appears to be in the mainstream of federal judges, where the norm has been to hand down lighter sentences than for those who produce child pornography. Even conservative legal commentators who oppose Jackson\u2019s confirmation have registered their disagreement with this line of inquiry. Andrew McCarthy of the conservative magazine National Review wrote that Hawley\u2019s charges were \u201cmeritless to the point of demagoguery.\u201d But Hawley, who has cultivated a reputation as a hardline populist conservative with a particular emphasis on pro-family policies, remained committed to pressing the point. The Missouri Republican engaged in a tense back-and-forth with Jackson on Tuesday over her sentencing in a case of an 18-year-old convicted of possessing child pornography, which allowed him to argue Jackson\u2019s views toward sex offenders is too lenient. \u201cI am questioning your discretion and your judgment,\u201d he said. In signaling early on he would pursue this line of questioning, Hawley emerged as something of a leader among the Republican committee members. Several, including Cruz (who precedes Hawley in seniority on the committee and was able to ask his questions first), pressed Jackson on her sentencing record in child pornography cases as well. There\u2019s little surprise that Cotton embraced his reputation as a law-and-order Republican. Even in his opening remarks on Monday, he laid into his main target: the Biden administration, which he said is \u201cwaging a war on the rule of law, the separation of powers and the Constitution.\u201d Cotton tied his critique of the current president to the need for an impartial judiciary. That, Cotton said, requires Jackson to outline her judicial philosophy beyond broad statements about her commitment to integrity, fairness, and established precedents. ANALYSIS: Here's definitive proof this Republican senator is afraid of Donald Trump \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to say only that one would look at the facts and arguments in the case and fairly apply the law. That wouldn\u2019t tell us anything about how one plans to do the job, how one interprets the law, how one understands our Constitution,\u201d Cotton said. The Arkansas Republican then took the opportunity to outline his own view of what sort of qualities he would seek in a Supreme Court nominee, a speech that would not be out of place in an early primary state. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a justice that would uphold the Constitution, not use it to invent new so-called rights. I\u2019m looking for a justice who understands the Constitution means what it says and does not mean what it doesn\u2019t say,\u201d Cotton said. And in his Tuesday questions for Jackson, Cotton took issue with her approach to sentencing convicted felons, as well as her views on resentencing. While Jackson defended her past decisions as consistent with federal statutes, Cotton was able to register his broad opposition to laws and proposals that reduce sentences for such crimes \u2013 including the First Step Act, signed into law by Trump.",

            "article_content": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson could make history as the first Black female Supreme Court justice but some Senate Republicans with their eyes on higher political office are making her confirmation hearing all about them. \u201cDo you agree \u2026 that babies are racist?\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas asked Jackson at one point on Tuesday, as he mined books in the curriculum of her children\u2019s school in a made-for-conservative-TV grilling on cultural war issues that power Republican politics. Nothing in Jackson\u2019s second day before the Senate Judiciary Committee suggested her nomination is in difficulty, given the narrow Democratic majority in the full chamber. But while they probably can\u2019t stop her taking a seat on the high court, some Republicans tried to turn her into a caricature of President Joe Biden\u2019s policies ahead of midterm elections in November and their own possible future White House bids. Takeaways from the marathon Ketanji Brown Jackson confirmation hearing Wary of being seen as bullying the historic nominee, Republican senators praised Jackson\u2019s credentials, character and intellect. But that didn\u2019t stop some of them from portraying her as an advocate for child predators, a friend of terrorists, associated with Marxist anti-White doctrine and also soft on crime. The latter charge \u2013 that Democrats are against police and weak on crime \u2013 is a centerpiece of the Republican midterm campaign message. The overtly political nature of the questioning was underscored on Wednesday when Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who cross-examined Jackson the day before with misleading claims that she was out of the mainstream of judges on the sentencing of child porn offenders, gladly embraced White House criticism of his conduct to trigger a public political showdown. \u201cThe White House is, as I understand it, pulling out all of their favorite conspiracy theories, all of their buzzwords, QAnon \u2026 the vast right-wing conspiracy I\u2019m sure will be next,\u201d Hawley told reporters. \u201cI just think it\u2019s interesting that for this White House, if you want to talk about crime, or you want to talk about the threats to children, you\u2019re dismissed as a conspiracy theorist, just like if you\u2019re a parent and you have concerns about your children being taught critical race theory at school or wearing a mask, you\u2019re dismissed as a domestic terrorist.\u201d Andrew Bates, a White House deputy press secretary, had on Tuesday accused Hawley on Twitter of launching an \u201cembarrassing, QAnon-signaling smear\u201d in a reference to the conspiracy movement which has circulated outlandish false claims about Democrats and child sex rings. Given the intense media focus on the war in Ukraine and the fact that the ideological makeup of the court is not at stake, it is not yet clear whether this hearing will have the vote-moving potential of previous such sagas, especially more than seven months before the November elections. And even thunder clap moments in confirmation hearings hardly guarantee campaign trail success, as then-senator and now-Vice President Kamala Harris found out after skewering now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh, to the delight of liberals in 2018, ahead of her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. But yet another hyper-partisan Judiciary Committee circus over a potential Supreme Court justice is sure to further tarnish the reputation of a critical branch of government at an already fraught political moment. Nomination hearings should include a vigorous examination of a candidate\u2019s record. But many of Tuesday\u2019s questions \u2013 especially from Republican senators like Missouri\u2019s Josh Hawley and Cruz, who may have presidential aspirations \u2013 had little to do with the duties of a potential Supreme Court associate justice. The questions often selectively cited various trials over which she presided. There was also a palpable racial undertone to some of the questions. Cruz, for example, called on Jackson to answer for critical race theory \u2013 a concept that seeks to understand and address inequality and racism in the US. The term has been politicized by some conservatives into claims liberals are waging a battle against White America, and Republicans seem to believe it\u2019s become a potent motivating factor for their base. But insinuations that Jackson is a cypher of a racist movement are ironic since her nomination actually highlights more than 200 years and counting of White male justices dominating a high court that has never had a Black woman. Ketanji Brown Jackson's confirmation hearing: Day 2 Jackson\u2019s hearings are not taking place in a vacuum. The idea that the Supreme Court is an apolitical branch of government above the grubbiness of politics has always been quaint. But since 2000, when it decided a disputed presidential election, and after a conservative majority was built on hardball tactics by Senate Republicans, it\u2019s become ever more politicized. The antics of some GOP senators took the process even further on Tuesday. Some implicitly justified their treatment of Jackson by referring to contentious 2018 hearings in which Democrats raised historic sexual misconduct allegations against Kavanaugh, which he denied and that the then-Republican Senate majority never fully investigated. Their attitude underscored how every Supreme Court nomination hearing is now a forum for Republicans and Democrats to grind their axes over long-simmering grievances about previous nominations \u2013 dating back to Biden\u2019s treatment of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s conservative nominee, Robert Bork, in 1987. Such hearings also drip with hypocrisy. One top Republican on the panel, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, implied Jackson was a radical since her nomination was hailed by liberal outside groups. He ignored how the current 6-3 conservative majority on the court was built on the efforts of right-wing groups advocating for justices that share their political views. The Supreme Court finds itself at a particular political crossroads, with a deeply conservative majority delivering rulings that will shape a sharply divided country for decades, on issues like abortion and gun control, which may often conflict with majority opinion in the United States. It can hardly afford spectacles that further taint its legitimacy in the eyes of many Americans. Yet that is what it got in Tuesday\u2019s hearing. In one of the most obviously politicized moments, Cruz brought up books he said were taught at a private school Jackson\u2019s children attended and where she serves on the board of trustees. He showed a blown-up picture of a page in one book, \u201cAntiracist Baby,\u201d that he described as \u201cstunning\u201d and criticized the school\u2019s curriculum as overflowing with critical race theory. \u201cDo you agree with this book that is being taught (to) kids that babies are racist?\u201d Cruz asked. In response, Jackson sighed, in one of her few signs of impatience in a long day. She said she didn\u2019t believe any child should be told they were racist. \u201cI\u2019ve never studied critical race theory and I\u2019ve never used it. It doesn\u2019t come up in the work that I do as a judge,\u201d Jackson told Cruz. How a school curriculum over which Jackson has no control was relevant to her nomination was unclear. But Cruz had his political moment. Not all Republican senators went for histrionics. Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who is deeply conservative, held a respectful discussion with Jackson on the Constitution. Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who is highly unlikely to vote to confirm her, tried to tease out her views on the late Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s theory of originalism and on the more expansive theory of constitutional interpretation held by liberal justice Stephen Breyer, whom Jackson hopes to replace. But the nominee was soon under fire for her handling of child porn offender cases in which she sometimes handed down sentences lighter than prosecutors were seeking and what was recommended by US sentencing guidelines set by Congress. But Jackson is in the mainstream of judges \u2013 both liberal and conservative \u2013 who regard the guidelines as out of date and hard to interpret for intricate cases. Cruz said that he detected in Jackson a \u201crecord of activism and advocacy as it concerns sexual predators that stems back decades.\u201d And Hawley, another potential 2024 or 2028 presidential candidate, who originally raised her sentencing of child porn offenders, spent almost all of his allocated half hour on a single case in which she sentenced the offender to three months. Prosecutors had sought 24 months, a recommendation far below the 97-121 month guidelines in the case. Hawley said he had a \u201chard time\u201d getting his head around such an outcome. Jackson described the nuances of the case, which the Missouri Republican wasn\u2019t keen to accept. She told Hawley she spoke as a judge and a mom tasked with reviewing evidence. \u201cIt is heinous. It is egregious.\u201d Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee closed the evening\u2019s questioning by narrowing in on another issue being used by Republicans in some political messaging \u2013 transgender athletes. She asked Jackson to define \u201cthe word woman\u201d and alluded to the success of University of Pennsylvania swimmer Lia Thomas, the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title. Jackson demurred on Blackburn\u2019s question about what message Thomas\u2019 victory sends, noting that related legal issues could come before the court. Earlier, Jackson had rejected criticism of her time as a public defender for Guantanamo Bay detainees \u2013 a role that ensures that defendants, even those charged with the most savage crimes, get their constitutional right to a fair trial. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes our system the best in the world. That\u2019s what makes us exemplary,\u201d she said. Sen. Tom Cotton, another Republican sometimes mentioned as a possible future presidential candidate, accused Jackson of twisting the law in another case because she was sympathetic to a drug kingpin. Jackson rejected the charge by the Arkansas senator, saying she was following guidelines laid down by Congress in sentencing. Blunt and somewhat condescending, Cotton posed a series of questions about whether police should arrest more criminals and whether sentences for those convicted should be longer. Cotton, a graduate of Harvard Law School, would have been aware that many of these questions were policy orientated and beyond a judge\u2019s purview. But he now has TV footage he can use in a political context to argue that Biden\u2019s nominee for the Supreme Court couldn\u2019t say whether murderers should stay longer in jail.",

            "article_content": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, a groundbreaking nominee, appears before senators Monday for a seat on a Supreme Court that itself has been moving in reverse. The court has allowed Texas to ban abortions since September and appears on the cusp of obliterating a half-century of reproductive rights nationwide. It has retrenched on voting rights protection and racial remedies. And it has increasingly sided with conservative believers in disputes over the separation of church and state. Jackson\u2019s hearings will showcase her status as the first Black woman nominated to the high court. Yet the televised sessions will also bring into national focus the trajectory of America\u2019s highest court, now controlled by a conservative supermajority. Solidified by the 2020 succession of Amy Coney Barrett to the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s seat, the majority is likely to produce an even greater sea change in American law by the summer when its current session ends. Republican-appointed conservatives see their efforts as correcting the past course. On abortion rights, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote two years ago that \u201cin a highly politicized and contentious arena \u2026 we have lost our way.\u201d Liberals counter today that the sudden change brought about by new justices undermines the court\u2019s institutional legitimacy. During December arguments in a Mississippi abortion ban dispute, Justice Sonia Sotomayor observed that state officials believed their law would be upheld because of the court\u2019s new members. \u201cWill this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?\u201d she asked. The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings may provide an early glimpse into how Jackson, 51, would view her place on the court\u2019s diminished liberal wing and how she might work with colleagues on both sides of the ideological divide. President Joe Biden chose Jackson to succeed the retiring Justice Stephen Breyer. She is a former federal public defender who has sat on lower US courts for nearly a decade. The Harvard Law graduate also served early in her career as a law clerk to Breyer. Not since 2010, and the nomination of Elena Kagan, has a Democratic nominee been before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (In 2016, President Barack Obama selected Merrick Garland for a vacancy created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but the Republican-controlled Senate refused to hold hearings or act on the nomination.) Kagan joined a 5-4, conservative-liberal bench, and in the 12 years since, the rightward thrust has only deepened, on abortion, religious liberty and voting rights. The 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision has especially defined the court under Chief Justice John Roberts. It eliminated a section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required states and localities with a history of discrimination to seek approval from the Department of Justice before changing election rules. That decision and others, including those allowing extreme partisan gerrymanders and big spending in elections, have lowered the guardrails of democracy. At the same time, states have increasingly passed regulations for the polls, and federal legislation to safeguard voting rights has stalled in Congress. Last month, when the justices summarily reinstated an Alabama congressional map that a lower court found had diluted the voting power of Blacks in the state, Kagan lamented a further undermining of the Voting Rights Act, \u201ca law this Court once knew to buttress all of American democracy.\u201d Republicans have dominated the Supreme Court for decades, simply by virtue of who held the White House and when vacancies occurred on the bench. Since 1969, when the liberal tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren ended, 19 new justices have been seated, 15 of them appointed by Republican presidents, four by Democrats. But the Republican appointees were varied enough that their political and ideological identities did not always align, as with GOP-appointed liberals Harry Blackmun, John Paul Stevens and David Souter. (Chief Justice Warren himself was an appointee of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower.) Such variation has evaporated, overtaken by the diligent ideological screening that former President Donald Trump and his recent GOP predecessors conducted with the assistance of the Federalist Society and outside advocates. Democrats like Biden have sought out liberal jurists, yet simultaneously looked for diversity. Jackson would be the first Black woman on the Supreme Court in its 233-year history. President Barack Obama named the first Hispanic justice, Sotomayor, in 2009, and Lyndon Johnson appointed the first African American, Thurgood Marshall, in 1967. Republican Ronald Reagan named the first woman justice, Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, in 1981. The new majority\u2019s suspension of abortion rights has been one of the most startling developments. Last September, the court refused to block a Texas statute that bans abortions at roughly six weeks, before most women know they are pregnant. The law defies the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal nationwide and barred government from imposing an undue burden on women seeking to end a pregnancy before the fetus is viable, at about 23 weeks. Abortion clinics in Texas, along with the US Department of Justice, asked the Supreme Court to block the law, without success. (The Texas Supreme Court this month foreclosed a related challenge, and pregnant women in Texas have been traveling to nearby states, for medical care.) Separate to the Texas case, the Supreme Court is currently weighing the constitutionality of Mississippi\u2019s 15-week ban on abortions. State officials have asked the justices to use the case to completely overturn Roe v. Wade. Other Republican-led states have taken a page from Mississippi. The Florida Legislature earlier this month passed a 15-week ban. In response, Biden tweeted, \u201cMy Administration will not stand for the continued erosion of women\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d The Supreme Court majority will have the last word on whether a right to abortion remains, as the court found in 1973, grounded in the 14th Amendment\u2019s liberty guarantee. Religion necessarily colors disputes over reproductive rights, and it has become a dominant theme at the transformed court. Some justices have complained that religious liberties are under siege. In a 2020 speech to the Federalist Society, Justice Samuel Alito used Covid-19 rules, including capacity limits on worship services, as an example. \u201cThe pandemic has resulted in previously unimaginable restrictions on individual liberty,\u201d he said. Yet the conservative majority has sided with religious groups challenging Covid-19 restrictions and, more broadly, exempted religious believers from myriad government regulations. In 2020, it sided with the Trump administration as the administration bolstered the ability of private employers to opt out of Obamacare birth control coverage in employee insurance plans based on religious or moral objections. The nation\u2019s first Black woman justice would be joining a bench scheduled to plunge immediately into new racial dilemmas. The justices said they would revisit prior decisions allowing colleges and universities to consider applicants\u2019 race as one of many criteria to achieve campus diversity. A group called Students for Fair Admissions is challenging racial affirmative action policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. Those cases will be heard in the 2022-23 session that begins in October. Even before the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative supermajority was clinched by the Trump appointees, the justices had rejected certain racial remedies, including public school voluntary-integration plans. Roberts wrote in that 2007 case, rejecting plans that considered students\u2019 race in school assignment: \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d But the court (over the chief justice\u2019s dissent) had narrowly upheld college affirmative action. Such practices appear ripe for reversal now, with the 2018 addition of Brett Kavanaugh for retired Justice Anthony Kennedy and with Barrett for Ginsburg. Kennedy and Ginsburg had previously voted to allow affirmative action. The new majority is also likely to continue to scale back the 1965 Voting Rights Act with the redistricting controversy already accepted for the 2022-23 session. (In 2021, the court spurned voting rights concerns and upheld Arizona measures that required ballots cast by people at the wrong precinct to be wholly discarded and that separately criminalized third-party collection of absentee ballots, for example, from residents at a nursing home.) In the Alabama redistricting dispute added to the justices\u2019 upcoming calendar, a special three-judge panel said the state should have created a second majority-Black district, based on the Black population and its geographic compactness. The lower federal panel said of the disputed map (which the Supreme Court revived), \u201cBlack voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress.\u201d A separate high court development could affect future federal elections, including presidential contests. As the justices earlier this month rejected Republican challenges to congressional maps in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, four conservatives expressed interest in a theory that would give state legislatures full control over how their federal elections are conducted, without any check by their own state courts and state constitutions. That controversial doctrine, pressed by Trump lawyers in 2020, could have upended the results of the last presidential election and could affect what happens in 2024. \u201cWe will have to resolve this question sooner or later,\u201d Alito wrote on March 7, dissenting from a court order declining to intervene in the North Carolina case, \u201cand the sooner we do so, the better.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court confirmation hearings were first televised, gavel-to-gavel, when Sandra Day O\u2019Connor appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981. The country\u2019s first woman justice, nominated by President Ronald Reagan, made deft use of the forum to introduce herself to the nation and eventually to win confirmation by a 99-0 vote. Since then, audiences have seen other historic moments, dramatic flashpoints and instances of levity. As the Senate begins its hearings for President Joe Biden\u2019s choice of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who would be the first Black woman justice, here are 10 of the many episodes that have stood out over the past four decades. She emphasized at the outset her experience as a state court judge in Arizona and her devotion to family. \u201cBy way of preamble,\u201d she said as she began introducing her family, \u201cI would note that \u2026 I have performed some marriage ceremonies in my capacity as judge.\u201d She then read from the form she used describing marriage as \u201cthe foundation of the family, mankind\u2019s basic unit of society, the hope of the world and strength of the country.\u201d O\u2019Connor was a former state senator and experienced politician who nimbly handled queries about the law and her life. The Senate confirmed her without any dissent. This nominee of Reagan with a deeply conservative record faced a Democratic Senate, and in particular, Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy set much of the tone when he dramatically claimed of the then-President\u2019s plan to elevate the US appellate court judge: \u201cRobert Bork\u2019s America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, Blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens\u2019 doors in midnight raids.\u201d At the hearings, Bork\u2019s right-wing ideology, rather than his intelligence and experience, remained the focus. When asked why he wanted to be a justice, he memorably stressed the \u201cintellectual feast\u201d of it all: \u201cI have spent my life in the intellectual pursuits in the law. And since I\u2019ve been a judge, I particularly like the courtroom. I like the courtroom as an advocate and I like the courtroom as a judge. \u2026 (T)hat\u2019s of course the Court that has the most interesting cases and issues, and I think it would be an intellectual feast just to be there and to read the briefs and discuss things with counsel and discuss things with my colleagues.\u201d Bork was defeated 58-42. He was nominated by President George H.W. Bush to succeed the first Black justice, Thurgood Marshall, who was retiring. Thomas, also African American, underwent two sets of hearings, the first devoted to his substantive record, the second following the sexual harassment accusations of law professor Anita Hill, a former Thomas employee. He categorically denied the charges, declaring to the committee, chaired by then-Sen. Joe Biden, \u201cThis is a circus. It\u2019s a national disgrace. And from my standpoint as a Black American, as far as I am concerned, it\u2019s a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves.\u201d The Senate confirmed him 52-48, which at that point was the closest Supreme Court confirmation vote in more than a century. President George W. Bush nominated him to be chief justice upon the death of William Rehnquist, and Roberts\u2019 balls-and-strikes metaphor continues to be evoked by judicial candidates today: \u201cJudges are like umpires,\u201d Roberts told senators. \u201cUmpires don\u2019t make the rules, they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the umpire.\u201d Roberts was confirmed for chief justice by a 78-22 vote. Biden remained an active Senate Judiciary Committee questioner even after he passed on the committee chairmanship, and he brought in a prop for an exchange with Alito. The then-senator was exploring the nominee\u2019s connection to a Princeton alumni group reputed to oppose the admission of women and minorities. Biden first referred to Alito\u2019s Italian-American background and his own Irish Catholic roots. \u201cI read your opening statement again, where you said that, \u2018A generation earlier I think that somebody from my background probably would not have felt fully comfortable at a college like Princeton.\u2019 \u2026 That\u2019s how I felt,\u201d said Biden, who went to the University of Delaware for college. Biden then produced a Princeton cap and put it on. \u201cI can wear this hat proudly today,\u201d he said, because the university improved its record of women and minority admissions. Alito told senators he could not recall participating in the controversial group. The Senate confirmed him 58-42. The child of Puerto Rican parents was nominated by President Barack Obama as the first Hispanic justice. She drew some controversy for a remark she often made as she spoke to women\u2019s legal groups, that \u201cI would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn\u2019t lived that life.\u201d Some Republicans contended the comment was racist and it began to take on a life of its own. At her hearings, Sotomayor said she wanted to make clear that she was simply trying to inspire Latinas to believe that their life experiences would enrich the legal system. \u201cI want to state upfront and unequivocally and without doubt, I do not believe any ethnic, racial, or gender group has an advantage in sound judging.\u201d She was confirmed 68-31. Obama\u2019s second nominee produced one of the lighter memorable exchanges as she was questioned by Sen. Lindsey Graham. The South Carolina Republican began asking her about a failed al Qaeda bomb plot on Christmas Day in 2009. Kagan was wary about where he was heading with his questioning about the man apprehended. \u201cNo,\u201d Graham said, \u201cI just asked you where you were on Christmas.\u201d She rejoined, \u201cYou know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant.\u201d Appreciating the levity, Graham said, \u201cGreat answer.\u201d The Senate approved Kagan 63-37. President Donald Trump\u2019s first choice for the high court had a record from more than a decade as a US appellate court judge based in Denver, but one case was particularly targeted. It involved a trucker whose rig had broken down in sub-zero temperatures and who, against company rules, unhitched it and drove away to warm up awhile. When the case came before him, Gorsuch interpreted federal law to say the trucker who was fired was not covered by the usual statutory labor protections. Then-Sen. Al Franken, a Minnesota Democrat, drilled down on the case, identifying with the trucker and describing his plight as \u201cabsurd.\u201d Gorsuch said his decision was limited by his interpretation of the law at issue. When pressed by Franken about what he would have done if he had been a trucker, the judge said: \u201cOh, Senator, I do not know what I would have done if I were in his shoes, and I do not blame him at all for a moment for doing what he did. I empathize with him entirely.\u201d The Senate confirmed Gorsuch 54-45. This Trump nominee, like Thomas, had two sets of hearings, the second prompted by a sexual assault claim raised by psychology professor Christine Blasey Ford, dating to their teenage years living in the Washington, DC, suburbs. Kavanaugh categorically denied the claim and told the committee, \u201cThis whole two-week effort has been a calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups. This is a circus. The consequences will extend long past my nomination. The consequences will be with us for decades. This grotesque and coordinated character assassination will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country. And as we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around. I am an optimistic guy, I always try to be on the sunrise side of the mountain, to be optimistic about the day that is coming, but today I have to say that I fear for the future.\u201d The Senate confirmed him 50-48. Graham chaired the Judiciary Committee hearings for Trump\u2019s third nominee and declared at the outset, \u201cThis is the first time in American history that we\u2019ve nominated a woman who\u2019s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.\u201d Barrett, a former Notre Dame law professor, had been vocal regarding her Catholic faith and opposition to abortion rights. In her own testimony, Barrett said she had \u201cno agenda\u201d regarding the reversal of the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion rights precedent dating to the 1973 Roe v. Wade. Barrett testified without notes and, at the urging of Sen. John Cornyn, held up the blank notepad that was on the desk before her. \u201cThat\u2019s impressive,\u201d the Texas Republican said. The Senate confirmed her 52-48.",

The 24-year-old Pennsylvanian \u2013 who serves as the communications director for the American Conservation Coalition, a conservative environmental group \u2013 often gets pushback from both Democrats and Republicans who say her beliefs are contradictory. \u201cAt this point in my life, I kind of laugh off criticism like that,\u201d Matthews told CNN, adding that she received similar feedback in college for being young and conservative, as if the two are mutually exclusive. \u201cCaring about climate change and being conservative and believing in small government are compatible,\u201d she said. Matthews is representative of the young conservatives who have come of age in a time marked by one crisis after another \u2013 from 9/11 to the 2008 financial collapse, school shootings, climate change and Covid-19. Youth activism on these issues, both in the streets and online, gives the impression that this generation is exceptionally liberal, and young Americans ages 18-29 do lean to the left \u2013 only 36% voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020, according to CNN\u2019s exit polls. Yet there are a number of young voters who are for limited government and fiscal conservativism but didn\u2019t align with Trump and his policies. Now, frustrated by record-high gas prices, grocery prices and Russia\u2019s invasion in Ukraine, conservatives believe that both Trump voters and non-Trump voters alike will rally around these core issues, leading to electoral success for Republicans in the 2022 midterms. \u201cYoung Americans are being left behind in Biden\u2019s America \u2013 we\u2019re facing skyrocketing prices, Biden\u2019s gas hike, and we\u2019ve lost precious time in the classroom that we can\u2019t get back. Meanwhile, states with Republican leadership have led the way in economic recovery and getting students back in school and young Americans back to work,\u201d RNC Deputy Press Secretary Will O\u2019Grady told CNN in a statement. \u201cThe RNC has been on the ground since last cycle, engaging and recruiting our next generation of conservative voters who value freedom, opportunity, and love for our country.\u201d The RNC said that ahead of 2022, it continues to build out its network with young Americans and is recruiting campus team leaders as part of its Campus Team Leader Initiative, a youth engagement program which started as part of the Trump Victory Fund. One of the largest groups of young Republicans, the College Republicans organization, told CNN it has beefed up its \u201cvolunteer strike force\u201d which, ahead of the midterms, will focus on making phone calls and knocking on doors for GOP candidates. \u201cOn the right, we\u2019re really motivated right now because we\u2019re fed up and want change,\u201d Courtney Britt, the 25-year-old chairman of College Republicans, told CNN. \u201cThe youth vote in the middle is leaning our way right now because they see the things Democrats promised them are not coming to fruition. Maybe it\u2019s time to give Republican policies a try.\u201d Midterm elections usually don\u2019t bode well for the party in power, and 2022 may be no different. It presents an opportunity for the Republican Party to win back some young conservative voters who either withheld from voting for president or voted for Joe Biden in 2020. Since taking office, President Biden\u2019s approval rating has declined among young voters and non-Democrats who once supported the Democratic President, according to CNN\u2019s latest full CNN/SSRS poll. According to the poll, those younger than 45 make up 60% of the voters who say they cast a ballot for Biden in 2020 and don\u2019t approve of the job he is doing. They\u2019re only 33% of the voters who say they voted for Biden and approve of him. \u201cLeadership is up for grabs with young people. We\u2019re just really hungry for leadership,\u201d Matthews, who didn\u2019t vote for president in 2020, told CNN. Matthews said that despite not casting a ballot for president in 2020, her decision did \u201cnot necessarily,\u201d mean she was \u201crejecting the conservative movement.\u201d \u201cI think Republicans should be looking at 2022 as a huge opportunity to really appeal to the young disillusioned voter,\u201d she said. Like Matthews, Ally Chun, a 20-year-old Republican from New York, said, \u201cI think that a lot of people are extremely dissatisfied with how things are going now.\u201d \u201cHow Biden has acted during the situation we\u2019ve been in with Ukraine is a huge red flag,\u201d Chun, who voted for Biden in 2020, said. \u201cI think that\u2019s really going to incentivize young Republicans and people who are moderate.\u201d In 2020 groups like College Republicans for Biden and Gen Z GOP formed, aiming to give center-right Gen Z voters a home amid a Republican administration and presidential reelection campaign they felt did not represent their beliefs or values. At the time, these conservative voters \u2013 who said they prioritized small government, capitalism and free market values but cared deeply about climate change, racial justice and health care access \u2013 told CNN they were disillusioned with Trump and the state of the Republican Party, which they said spewed hate and misinformation. But they were also uncomfortable with Biden and the Democratic platform. For his part, Christopher Trzaska, who founded College Republicans for Biden in 2020 and is from New Jersey, said in 2021 he excitedly cast a ballot for Jack Ciattarelli, the then-Republican candidate for governor in his home state. The 21-year-old, who told CNN he disaffiliated with the Republican Party after the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6, 2021 and re-reregistered as an independent, is eager to vote Republican again in 2022, he said, insisting he is still and always has been a conservative. \u201cYou could drop me in the Bush administration, and I\u2019d feel right at home,\u201d Trzaska said, although he does understand Gen Z\u2019s craving for something new and different. \u201cGen Z and many conservatives of my age are looking for someone to shake up the system, but not to burn the country down in the process.\u201d He noted that his vote for Biden wasn\u2019t an endorsement for progressives like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York or Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. \u201cLooking ahead to 2024, who knows? If it\u2019s Trump, absolutely not,\u201d Trzaska said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s Ron DeSantis against Kamala Harris, that\u2019s a decision to make, and that\u2019s not a given one.\u201d \u201cTrump is the leader of the Republican Party, I think that\u2019s pretty evident in terms of just the mathematics of it,\u201d Trzaska said, and while he opposes the former President, he said that \u201cnot every Trump endorsement is created equal,\u201d adding that he could back a Trump-endorsed candidate, depending on who that candidate is. According to Britt, who listed high gas and grocery prices as issues for young Americans, College Republicans are \u201cnot as different from the general population\u201d when it comes to the issues they care about most this election cycle. \u201cWe definitely hear from a number of people especially with inflation these days, complaining about gas prices and groceries and other day to day things that affect them,\u201d Ebo Entsuah, a city councilman in Clermont, Florida, said. Despite his position as a nonpartisan elected official, Entsuah, who is 28 years old, leans to the right. Entsuah said he\u2019s heard from many of his peers, even those who lean further to the left who feel, \u201cfed up and sick of the way the current administration has been going about its work and having nothing to show for it.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Ukraine right, and with foreign policy, just adds to additional frustration that Republicans across the board have with this current administration, have with Congress. That doesn\u2019t fare well for Democrats in 2022,\u201d said Iowa state Rep. Joe Mitchell, a Republican who founded Run GenZ, a group that is recruiting, mentoring and training young conservatives to run for down ballot office. The group plans to work with 36 candidates across the country running for state and local offices in 2022. Likewise, Topher D\u2019Anna, spokesperson for Karoline Leavitt \u2013 a Gen Z Republican running for Congress in New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District \u2013 said the young voters Leavitt talks to along the campaign trail have expressed the same concerns as their older counterparts. \u201cIn years past you\u2019ve seen younger voters be focused on issues such as climate change or things like that, and they still are, but the turnaround if you will\u2026 you have all of these generations focused on the same thing is pretty incredible,\u201d D\u2019Anna said. \u201cDespite these people being younger, high gas prices are hitting them. They\u2019re seeing the cost of inflation as well. So it\u2019s a lot about the economics and why we need fiscal conservative policies in the cycle that we\u2019re in right now,\u201d he said. Leavitt, who worked as an assistant press secretary in the Trump White House under press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and following the 2020 election, served as communications director for GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, is part of House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s \u201cYoung Guns\u201d recruitment program, which includes promising candidates in competitive races who have met key fundraising benchmarks. The congressional candidate has also touted false claims that Trump won the 2020 presidential election. While young Republicans are emphasizing spending and inflation as the issues they care about most this election cycle, a focus on the economy is not unprecedented for young conservative voters. \u201cIt is not remotely unusual for economic issues, debt, to be top of mind for young Republicans,\u201d said Abby Kiesa, who has been polling young Americans for over a decade and is the deputy director of CIRCLE. On top of inflation and concerns about the war in Ukraine, John Olds, the 22-year-old founder of Gen Z GOP, said that young Americans still care about the lasting impact of Covid-19 restrictions. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a young person, you\u2019re super frustrated that your senior year of college was ruined by the pandemic, or you\u2019re not getting to go to your own graduation or your own prom, or any one of these seminal life moments that we used to take for granted,\u201d Olds said. \u201cLife has been put on hold for little bit too long and that sentiment is associated more with Democratic leadership,\u201d he said. Like Olds, Gurtej Singh Narang, who is the vice chair of Georgia College Republicans and a student at Georgia State University, believes that politicians\u2019 comments and actions on Covid restrictions will also be the \u201cnumber one messaging factor with GOP for young people in Georgia,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen it comes to (the race) against Stacey Abrams, we were one of the first states to open,\u201d Narang, who is 22 years old and worked on both of Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns as well as Georgia Governor Brian Kemp\u2019s 2018 election campaign and former Sen. David Perdue\u2019s 2020 reelection campaign, said. He believes young Republicans will automatically assume Abrams holds many of the same policies as the Biden administration and Democrats who were strict on Covid restrictions. As for young Republicans\u2019 vision for the party moving forward, both Olds and Narang said they believe the weight of Trump\u2019s endorsement is still noteworthy but waning with younger Republicans. \u201cThe Trump endorsement kind of has been losing its power among young people,\u201d Narang told CNN. \u201cThat being said there are your kids that still like are very, \u2018whoever Trump endorses should be the guy,\u2019\u201d he said, adding that Trump is \u201cdefinitely\u201d still a factor in Georgia\u2019s GOP primary races, especially when it comes to the state\u2019s gubernatorial race between Kemp and Perdue. Olds said he believes the Republican party is making an effort to recruit \u201cpost Trump\u201d candidates, citing Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who notably improved the GOP\u2019s standing with younger voters since the state\u2019s last gubernatorial election in 2017. \u201cDonald Trump obviously still has a hold on a good bit of the party, but I think that hold is certainly weakening,\u201d Olds said. \u201cJust speaking with activists on the ground and seeing what happened in Virginia, you can tell that the party still values electability, and since the former President lost, his brand is not as associated with electability.\u201d While Olds\u2019 view may match other moderate young Republicans, on the whole Republican and Republican-leaning voters are about evenly split between wanting their party to nominate Trump again (50%) or wanting a different candidate (49%) in 2024, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS last month. \u201cWhere we see ourselves plugging in is defining where the party is moving forward, and not necessarily on the past,\u201d Olds said of Gen Z GOP, who phone banked for Youngkin. According to CNN\u2019s exit polls, 45% of 18- to 29-year-olds voted for Youngkin in Virginia last fall, compared to the 32% of 18-year-olds who voted for 2017 Republican candidate Ed Gillespie. \u201cIf Virginia\u2019s elections last year indicated anything, it suggests that we are holding and gaining momentum on the right and they are losing it on the left, at least among youth voters,\u201d Britt said, noting College Republicans enthusiasm for Youngkin in Virginia last fall. After his victory, Youngkin was credited with writing a new Republican playbook for keeping Trump\u2019s base engaged without alienating the voters who were repelled by the former President in recent elections. His popularity with younger Republicans suggests there may be momentum for the \u201cpost-Trump\u201d candidates Olds described. \u201cYoung Republicans might not be marching in the streets, but they are mobilizing,\u201d said Mitchell, who, in his role as president of Run Gen Z, travels the country speaking to young Republicans across the ideological spectrum including chapters of College Republicans, Young Republicans and Turning Point USA \u2013 the right-wing organization closely tied to Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily the sexy protest scene that you\u2019re going to see on TV, but you\u2019re going to see these things on college campuses, in local races, and so I think all those things add up to proving that there is a lot of mobilizing happening that maybe hasn\u2019t happened in years past,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cWill there be a larger number of young Republicans who show up in 2022 than in the last midterms in 2018, 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think this year \u2013 2022 \u2013 will be an unprecedented year for Republicans in the midterms, which naturally will bring along young Republicans as well.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Conservative activist Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas said in an interview published Monday that although she attended a rally on January 6, 2021, she \u201cplayed no role\u201d in planning the events that day and that she doesn\u2019t involve her husband, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in the political work she does pushing conservative causes. The rare interview with conservative publication the Washington Free Beacon, comes as progressives and some legal ethics experts see a potential conflict with Thomas\u2019 activism and her husband\u2019s work on the Supreme Court. They point specifically to a recent January order when the court \u2013 over the dissent of Clarence Thomas \u2013 cleared the way for the release of presidential records from the Trump White House to a congressional committee investigating the US Capitol attack. In recent weeks, media outlets, including CNN, have run stories exploring Ginni Thomas\u2019 long term activism and calls for Justice Clarence Thomas to recuse. \u201cFederal recusal law says that any justice \u2018shall disqualify\u2019 if their impartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d said Gabe Roth of Fix the Court, a group seeking more transparency from Supreme Court justices. \u201cHere Virginia Thomas attended the rally on the ellipse, she is close to those who have been subpoenaed by the Committee and she is involved in several groups that have cast doubt on the results of the 2020 election,\u201d he said. But in the new interview, Ginni Thomas said that \u201cthe legal lane is my husband\u2019s\u201d and she seemed to distance herself from the January 6, 2021, events. \u201cLike so many married couples, we share many of the same ideals, principles and aspirations for America,\u201d Thomas told the Free Beacon. \u201cBut we have our own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too,\u201d she said. \u201cClarence doesn\u2019t discuss his work with me, and I don\u2019t involve him in my work,\u201d she said. Supreme Court justices largely make their own decisions whether to recuse themselves from a case, acting cautiously because if they were to step away, no other judge could take their place to rule. Critics say the system is flawed and there should be more transparency and accountability. In the interview, Ginni Thomas, who runs a political consulting firm, stressed that she is going to continue her role as a political activist. \u201cIf you are going to be true to yourself and your professional calling, you can never be intimidated, chilled or censored by what the press or others say,\u201d she said. She also clarified her actions on January 6. She said that she attended a rally but returned home before former President Donald Trump took the stage at noon. Rioting broke out after that. \u201cI was disappointed and frustrated that there was violence that happened following a peaceful gathering of Trump supporters on the Ellipse on January 6th,\u201d she said and added that she played \u201cno role\u201d with those who were planning and leading the events. \u201cThere are stories in the press suggesting I paid or arranged for buses. I did not.\u201d \u201cThere are important and legitimate substantive questions about achieving goals like electoral integrity, racial equality, and political accountability that a democratic system like ours needs to be able to discuss and debate rationally in the political square,\u201d she said. Social media posts obtained by Slate show her cheering on the January 6 rally that preceded the Capitol attack, though she later made clear, according to Slate, that she had published the posts before the rally turned violent. Since the rally she has signed a letter to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy urging the Republican conference to remove both GOP Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois due to their \u201cegregious actions\u201d as members of the House of Representative\u2019s select committee investigating the insurrection. Cheney and Kinzinger are serving at the request of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",

            "article_content": "Florida legislators have had a busy week, taking action on a number of GOP priorities related to America\u2019s culture wars as the state\u2019s legislative session draws to a near-close. The state\u2019s GOP-controlled House and Senate this week passed controversial laws that would: ban certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom; create a new security office to investigate election crimes and increase penalties for violating the state\u2019s elections laws; and ban public schools and private businesses from teaching people to feel guilty for historical events committed by people of their races. The bills now head to the desk of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his signature. DeSantis, who is up for reelection in 2022 and weighing a potential 2024 presidential bid, has signaled support for all three legislative measures. Republicans have repeatedly said that the bills on classroom curriculum are focused on parental choice and are not meant to be discriminatory. \u201cRead the bill. Trust parents. It is deeply disturbing that Democrats want adults who aren\u2019t a 5 year old\u2019s parent talking to them about sex,\u201d the Florida Republican Party said on Twitter on Thursday, a day after passage of the legislation dubbed the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill by its opponents. But Democrats in the state and opponents across the country have publicly decried the bills, suggesting they target minority communities and limit freedom of speech. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely the session of culture wars and red meat,\u201d Florida state Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat, told CNN. \u201cAttacks are being aimed at every community you care about, from Black and brown people to LGBTQ+ folks. We\u2019re also seeing attacks on immigrants.\u201d Eskamani said Florida Democrats are aware that the state is a testing ground for GOP policy priorities that could make their way elsewhere. \u201cThe concern a lot of us have is whatever happens in Florida, it does spread to other states,\u201d she said. The Florida Senate on Tuesday passed a bill that would ban certain instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in the classroom. The legislation now awaits DeSantis\u2019 approval, who has signaled his support for the measure. Conservatives have argued that the bill \u2013 titled Parental Rights in Education \u2013 is needed to give parents greater oversight over what students learn and discuss at school, stressing that LGBTQ-related topics should be left for families to discuss at home. \u201cTo provide protections for parents, for preschoolers, kindergarteners, first graders, I mean that is something, I think, most parents would appreciate,\u201d DeSantis told reporters about the bill last week. \u201cAnd we send the kids to school \u2013 young kids \u2013 and we want them to learn the basics. Some of these issues that are just simply not age-appropriate, I think parents want to see protection for that.\u201d Opponents, however, have dubbed it the \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill, arguing the ban it creates would negatively impact an already marginalized community. They\u2019ve pointed to data showing that LGBTQ youth reported lower rates of attempting suicide when they had access to LGBTQ-affirming spaces. The bill\u2019s opponents have also decried a part of the legislation that allows parents to bring civil suits against school districts for any potential violations of their rules, arguing it would open educators up to an endless barrage of litigation. The legislation has received scrutiny from Democrats in the state and elsewhere, including from President Joe Biden, who vowed last month to protect LGBTQ youth from such measures. The bill has also drawn the ire of Gen Z advocates, who have for weeks led major demonstrations and school walkouts in protest of the legislation. Jack Petocz, a high school junior who organized walkouts statewide and led his own at Flagler Palm Coast High School, said he had been suspended \u201cindefinitely\u201d after he distributed Pride flags at the demonstration. \u201cOn the day of protest, they tried to take away our Pride flags and stop us from distributing them at the event,\u201d Petocz told CNN. \u201cI resisted, because Pride flags are a symbol of our community, of our embrace of our queerness, and when you have these bills trying to target and silence queer youth, I didn\u2019t understand. I thought it was irrational to try to take away our Pride flags at a rally that is about anti-gay legislation.\u201d Equality Florida, the state\u2019s leading LGBTQ advocacy organization, has threatened legal action against the legislation. The Florida House on Wednesday night passed a voting overhaul bill that would create a security office to investigate election crimes and increase penalties for violating the state\u2019s elections laws. The measure is now headed to DeSantis for his signature. The legislation would establish a scaled-back version of an elections police force first proposed by DeSantis last year. The bill would set up an Office of Election Crimes and Security within the Department of State with a staff of 15 to conduct preliminary investigations of election fraud. In addition, the measure calls for DeSantis to appoint up to 10 law enforcement officers to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to probe election crimes. The combined effort would have a budget of about $3.7 million, said state Rep. Daniel Perez, the Republican lawmaker guiding the bill through the House. Perez said the new election crimes investigations unit would serve as an \u201cextra resource\u201d for local election supervisors to ensure \u201cthere are absolutely no cases falling through the cracks.\u201d \u201cThe more resources we have to attack the bad people, the bad actors who are committing fraud, the better for the state of Florida,\u201d Perez said during floor debate Tuesday night. \u201cThe more the merrier.\u201d Its opponents argued that this would deter voters. \u201cThe Anti-Voter Freedom Act was designed by Ron DeSantis and Florida Republicans, under the guise of \u2018election security,\u2019 to reduce turnout and make it harder for people to vote,\u201d Florida Democratic Party Director of Voter Protection Sam Koplewicz said in a statement about the bill Thursday. If the measure is enacted, Florida would become one of the first states to have a unit focused on election fraud. Election fraud is exceedingly rare, and Democrats and Republicans in the state previously described the 2020 election as smoothly run. DeSantis said last year that Florida had passed its automatic post-election audits with \u201cflying colors.\u201d On Thursday, the Florida Senate voted to ban public schools and private businesses from teaching people to feel guilty for historical events committed by people of their races. The bill \u2013 which would also prohibit instruction that says certain races or sexes are privileged or oppressed \u2013 had previously passed the state House and now heads to DeSantis\u2019 desk. DeSantis has led that charge on Florida\u2019s classroom culture war. Last year, his administration banned critical race theory from K-12 schools. In December, he called on lawmakers to extend the prohibition to all public schools, including colleges, and the workplace, in a proposal he named the Stop the Wrongs to Our Kids and Employees (W.O.K.E.) Act. \u201cWe must protect Florida workers against the hostile work environment that is created when large corporations force their employees to endure CRT-inspired \u2018training\u2019 and indoctrination,\u201d DeSantis said at the time. The legislation passed by the Senate does not specifically mention critical race theory, which acknowledges that racism is both systemic and institutional in American society and has benefited White people and oppressed Black and brown Americans. A bill analysis by state Senate staff, however, highlights the teaching of critical race theory as something that would be prohibited under the legislation. The bill previously said instruction cannot make people feel \u201cdiscomfort\u201d for their races or sexes, which drew widespread concern that it could lead to schools desensitizing historical events such as Jim Crow, the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II or the Stonewall riots. However, that language was changed to prohibit instruction that someone \u201cmust feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress\u201d for their race or sex. The legislation attempts to make clear that schools can teach about slavery and the history of racial segregation and discrimination in an \u201cage-appropriate manner\u201d but the instruction cannot \u201cindoctrinate or persuade students to a particular point of view.\u201d Democrats insist that despite Republicans\u2019 messaging the bills passed this week are mal-intentioned. \u201cIt\u2019s clear based on the rhetoric, based on who supports them, based on the intention of those who have supported these bills that the goal is to erase LGBTQ+ people, it\u2019s to erase conversations on Black history, on parts of America\u2019s past that are unsavory but are important for us to acknowledge so that we don\u2019t repeat them,\u201d Eskamani said.",

We\u2019re devoting this newsletter to redistricting \u2013 the once-a-decade process of redrawing the lines for congressional districts to reflect population shifts after the US Census. The main goal, as enshrined in the Constitution, is straightforward: US House seats should be equally apportioned among the states. New maps, then, must be drawn to reflect where the population has grown or shrunk. The process sounds simple \u2013 yet it is anything but that. And gerrymandering \u2013 the practice of drawing maps to benefit a political party or a group of voters \u2013 has helped make American politics more partisan. Districts have grown more homogenous, dominated by Republican voters or Democratic voters. If a congressional seat is safe from any real competition on Election Day, what incentive remains for a member of Congress to negotiate with the opposing party to actually accomplish something? We\u2019ve turned to three in-house experts who are following the issue closely \u2013 Ethan Cohen and Melissa Holzberg DePalo, who are producers for CNN\u2019s Political Unit, and CNN Politics\u2019 justice writer Tierney Sneed \u2013 to explain redistricting and to give CITIZEN BY CNN readers the latest developments. Who draws the maps? When redistricting works like it\u2019s supposed to, congressional district maps are drawn by either state lawmakers or by state redistricting commissions. But like many best-laid plans, that\u2019s not what has happened in every state. Courts have had to draw or choose the maps in six states, either because the normal processes failed to produce a plan (usually when control of state government is split between the parties) or because the produced maps failed to comply with legal standards. Where do things stand today with redistricting? Is it over yet? We\u2019re about eight months from Election Day and the redistricting process still isn\u2019t finished, delayed in part by the pandemic-driven late release of the census data required. Four states \u2013 Florida, Missouri, New Hampshire and Louisiana \u2013 still have yet to enact their final maps. In all four of those states, congressional maps are passed just like other legislation. Republicans have full control of state government in the first three states, but they haven\u2019t passed maps amid intra-GOP disputes about how aggressively to draw the lines. In Louisiana, the state legislature recently passed a new map, but Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards hasn\u2019t announced whether he\u2019ll sign it. And as litigation over newly drawn maps continues across the country, it\u2019s possible maps in other states will need to be revised as well. What\u2019s been the biggest surprise about redistricting? Republicans control most state legislatures across the country, so going into this redistricting process, a lot of analysts believed the GOP would be able to benefit significantly from new maps \u2013 especially since the party is trying to regain control of the House in November. But Democrats have had legal victories in states like Pennsylvania and North Carolina that resulted in more favorable maps. Democrats have also been able to utilize their advantage in states like New York, where they control the redistricting process. They now have a chance to come out better than expected, and perhaps even benefit from the new maps overall. However, Democrats still face an uphill climb to hold the House this November as they deal with President Joe Biden\u2019s low approval numbers and the historic trend of poor midterm performance from the party that controls the White House. Two of the strangest terms to arise about drawing congressional maps are \u201ccracking\u201d and \u201cpacking.\u201d What do they mean and how do they work? In the simplest terms, \u201ccracking\u201d and \u201cpacking\u201d are two ways congressional map-drawers gerrymander districts. Cracking is when mapmakers weaken a particular group\u2019s influence by spreading those voters throughout several districts. And packing is when specific voters are forced into one district, or as few districts as possible, to condense their influence. Tennessee Republicans gave us a good idea of what cracking looks like this year. For most of Tennessee\u2019s history, Nashville has been in one congressional district. And for most of modern political history, in a sea of deep-red Tennessee, Nashville\u2019s district consistently sent Democrats to Congress. But this year, Republicans in the state divided Davidson County, where Nashville is, into three congressional districts that are paired with more conservative and rural parts of the state. That split, or crack, will weaken the influence of the more liberal Nashville population. It also should be noted that Republicans aren\u2019t the only ones engaged in partisan map drawing. In states like New Mexico, Illinois and New York, Democrats drew lines to benefit their partisan interests. Where are the big legal fights happening and what are they about? With each redistricting cycle, the legal fight over partisan advantage in map-drawing seems to get more complicated. And this cycle is no exception. In 2019, the US Supreme Court said that federal courts could not play a role in policing partisan gerrymandering. So, some of the most impactful legal fights this cycle are playing out in state courts, where voters have challenged maps for giving one party too much of an advantage. Federal courts still have the authority to review claims of racial gerrymandering. Depending on the facts on the ground, maps alleged to be racially discriminatory can be challenged under the Voting Rights Act (VRA), under the Constitution or both. However, the Supreme Court has signaled that it may soon scale back the scope of the VRA in redistricting, which would leave voters, political parties and voter rights organizations with even fewer options to challenge unfair maps in court. In the lawsuits that are alleging that the political power of minority voters is being diluted, we are seeing a lot of arguments about how communities of color have grown in places like Texas and Georgia, with cases claiming that the new maps do not adequately reflect that growth. In Texas, for instance, people of color made up 95% of the population growth that led to the state being awarded two additional seats in the US House this decade. Yet both of those districts were drawn to have White voting majorities, as the Justice Department argued in the lawsuit it brought against the state. Americans already have begun to vote in primaries, so how will these court cases affect actual elections? It depends on the state. In some states, like Texas and Georgia, the current lawsuits won\u2019t change the maps before this year\u2019s election. Part of the issue legal challengers have run into is that maps were drawn much later last year than usual. That is because the Covid-19 pandemic delayed the 2020 Census \u2013 which produces the data for each decade\u2019s redrawing of maps \u2013 which, in turn, delayed the release date for the data from that survey. In some states, legislators or courts pushed back their electoral calendars because of coronavirus-created time crunch. But we\u2019re still seeing the legal fights over the maps run into election deadlines. In Ohio, for example, local election officials and GOP state leaders are sparring over whether to move the May 3 primary date as the redistricting commission has repeatedly seen its maps rejected by the Ohio Supreme Court. Another complication \u2013 particularly in the federal redistricting litigation \u2013 is a recent move by the Supreme Court that has discouraged lower courts from disturbing the maps for this years\u2019 election, even when those courts think the maps violate the law. Alabama earlier this year had been ordered by two federal courts to redraw its congressional map, after the courts found it likely violated the Voting Rights Act by diluting the political power of Black voters. But at Alabama\u2019s request, the Supreme Court, by a 5-4 vote, intervened to put that order on hold. The full majority didn\u2019t explain its reasoning, but Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a concurrence that touted a legal principle of avoiding court actions that could cause confusion among voters. Justice Elena Kagan, one of the court\u2019s liberal justices, shot back in a dissent: \u201cAlabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians\u2019 voting rights just because the court\u2019s order came down in the first month of an election year.\u201d Already, a district judge in Georgia has cited the Supreme Court\u2019s move in Alabama to explain he would not order Georgia to redraw its state legislative maps for its coming elections, even though the judge believes that they violated the Voting Rights Act. Where\u2019s the Supreme Court on all of this? As you may have picked up by now, the Supreme Court \u2013 particularly this current conservative majority \u2013 has generally shown more sympathy to legislators who have drawn potentially unfair or discriminatory maps than they have to the voters seeking to challenge those plans. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2015 Shelby County decision set the stage for this trend. In that case, the conservative majority gutted a provision in the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination in voting practices to get federal approval for their redistricting plans (and any other changes to their election policies). Since then, the court majority gave Texas key wins in a redistricting racial discrimination case stemming from the 2010 census cycle. The 2019 partisan redistricting decision, known as Rucho v. Common Cause put an end to any hopes that federal courts could rein in maps aggressively skewed towards one party or another. Though the court hasn\u2019t weighed in on the merits of the Alabama case, its willingness to jump in at the preliminary stage it was in suggests the court is going to scale back the Voting Rights Act\u2019s reach in redistricting once again, by making it harder for legal challengers to prove that maps can be drawn in way that don\u2019t undermine minority voters. However, in a setback for Republicans, the Supreme Court on Monday rebuffed efforts to disturb maps adopted by state courts in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. While the 2022 elections in Pennsylvania and North Carolina will be conducted with redistricting plans less favorable to Republicans, the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative wing has signaled an interest in considering a case down the road that would limit the ability of state courts to rein in partisan gerrymanders. In less than a month, voters will decide who will finish out ex-Rep. Devin Nunes\u2019 term in California\u2019s 22nd congressional district. Nunes left Congress earlier this year to run former President Donald Trump\u2019s social media company. The Republican exited office as the contours of his district changed through redistricting. The special election is April 5, with a runoff set for June 7 if no candidate receives more than 50% of the vote next month. Whoever wins the seat likely won\u2019t have a district to run in come November. The full list of candidates and details on how to vote can be found here from the California Secretary of State.

            "article_content": "From Florida, Georgia and Tennessee through Texas, South Dakota and Montana, Republican-controlled states are approving a torrent of culturally conservative hot-button legislation at a pace unmatched in recent times, and probably ever. States where the GOP controls both the governorship and state legislature are moving in unprecedented numbers to restrict abortion, limit access to voting, ban books, retrench transgender rights and constrain teachers\u2019 ability to discuss race, gender and sexual orientation at public K-12 schools and increasingly at public colleges and universities. Many of the same states are simultaneously rescinding restrictions on gun ownership, stiffening penalties for people engaged in unruly public protests and, in a new twist, empowering private citizens to bring lawsuits to enforce many of these initiatives, as Texas Republicans did on their recent law banning abortion after about six weeks. Rapidly spreading from state to state, these Republican-driven initiatives reflect the GOP coalition\u2019s shifting center of gravity away from the small-government, low-tax agenda that long topped its priorities toward the roiling cultural anxieties and resentments that have become central to its messaging, especially in the Donald Trump era. You have an emerging generation that is multiracial, multicultural, where no single ethnic or racial group is the majority, and it has struck an existential fear within those who are used to controlling everything, from the boardroom to the White House. So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away. Nadine Smith, executive director, Equality Florida More fundamentally, these red state moves are remaking the American civil liberties landscape at breathtaking speed \u2013 and with little national attention to their cumulative effect. Taken together, these moves amount to a stark reversal of what many legal scholars call the \u201crights revolution\u201d beginning in the 1960s, in which Congress and especially the Supreme Court expanded the number of rights available to all Americans nationwide and struck down state laws that constricted those rights on issues from racial segregation to abortion and same-sex marriage. In many ways, the red states are attempting to tilt the nation back toward a pre-1960s model, when the basic civil rights and civil liberties available to Americans diverged far more depending on where they lived. Further, with GOP senators wielding the filibuster and the Republican-appointed majority on the Supreme Court both providing powerful air cover for this red state ground offensive, Democrats and groups focused on defending civil rights, abortion rights and LGBTQ rights, among other issues, have not yet found any effective means of slowing the conservative onslaught. Even as the nation grows more racially, religiously and culturally diverse than ever, that means roughly half the states are on track to impose rules across this broad array of cultural flashpoints that primarily reflect the demands of one shrinking group: conservative and often older White Christians. \u201cYou have an emerging generation that is multiracial, multicultural, where no single ethnic or racial group is the majority, and it has struck an existential fear within those who are used to controlling everything, from the boardroom to the White House,\u201d says Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ advocacy group battling against the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d proposals from Florida Republicans that would severely restrict how teachers can talk about sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom. \u201cSo what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away.\u201d Conservatives praise the widening divergence among the states on this broad array of issues as a vindication of the belief among the nation\u2019s founders that states should have great leeway to set their own courses \u2013 a belief embodied in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution. \u201cThis is going to be a new test of federalism,\u201d Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, a conservative group that has promoted some of the conservative state initiatives, told me in a 2021 interview. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s a good thing, and it\u2019s largely how the founders envisioned this.\u201d A wide array of groups that promote civil rights and liberties, however, see the red state moves as a fundamental assault on constitutional rights that should be available nationwide to all Americans. \u201cWe are absolutely seeing what feels like two countries \u2013 opposed on so many fundamental questions,\u201d Deborah Archer, a professor at the New York University Law School and president of the American Civil Liberties Union, told me in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s the reality we are facing with abortion rights \u2013 pregnant people with fundamentally different protection of their Constitutional rights based on geography. That\u2019s the reality we may face with voting rights \u2013 Black voters with fundamentally different rights based on geography. That\u2019s the reality we are facing with the censorship of discussions about race in the classroom \u2013 children getting wildly different opportunities to learn about the history and reality of racism and racial inequality based on geography.\u201d The one undisputed point: On a panoramic range of volatile issues revolving around cultural values and racial equity, Republican-controlled states are advancing the most aggressive conservative agenda in memory. In a comment echoed to me by analysts in other states, political scientist Richard Murray, a senior researcher at the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, described last year\u2019s Texas state legislative session as \u201cthe most extreme session in modern Texas history. I\u2019ve been here since 1966 and nothing was comparable in all of those years.\u201d The red state offensive is advancing across a wide range of fronts, including: Abortion: Anticipating that the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority later this year will strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion, GOP-controlled states are approving a raft of new restrictions on the procedure. Seven states in 2021 passed laws retrenching access to abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute; that list included total bans that Texas and Oklahoma approved to go into effect if the high court allows. Texas also passed its separate law banning abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, and empowering citizens to sue anyone involved in providing one; five GOP-appointed Supreme Court justices, over the vehement objections of Chief Justice John Roberts and the three Democratic appointees, have refused to block implementation of that law while lower courts debate its constitutionality. In all, Guttmacher calculated, states approved 108 abortion restrictions of some sort in 2021 (such as constraints on access to abortion medication). The group says that\u2019s by far the most that have been approved in any single year since Roe. And the wave has not yet crested: Just this month, GOP-controlled legislatures in Florida, West Virginia and Arizona, anticipating that the GOP Supreme Court majority will overturn Roe, have advanced bills to ban abortion after 15 weeks. Voting: Laws making it more difficult to vote, and in several cases increasing the opportunity for Republican partisans to exert more influence over election administration and vote tabulation, have been probably the most visible component of the red state push. In 2021, 19 states \u2013 including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Montana and Texas \u2013 passed a total of 34 laws restricting access to voting, according to tabulations by the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School. The center counts 250 bills to further restrict voting access that have been introduced this year or carried over from last year\u2019s session and another 41 that could erode the integrity of election administration. Meanwhile, the new voter identification requirements in Texas have resulted in the rejection of so many mail ballots that local Democratic officials in Harris County have asked the US Justice Department to intervene. Education: Nothing has spread more rapidly across the red states than the laws \u2013 dubbed \u201cgag orders\u201d by critics \u2013 restricting how public school K-12 teachers can talk about current and historic racial and gender inequities. In 2021, nine Republican-controlled states passed laws establishing such restrictions and four others imposed them through executive branch actions. This year, according to PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors, 112 similar bills have been introduced in 34 states. Variations on the theme are multiplying: Virginia\u2019s newly elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, for instance, has created a \u201ctip line\u201d that residents can use to complain about teachers discussing supposedly \u201cdivisive\u201d concepts. Iowa\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature is considering legislation to install cameras in every classroom so that parents or others can monitor what teachers are saying. Avlon on book bans: Don't complain about cancel culture and try to cancel others This push to control what students are taught is also broadening in several ways. On one front, more of the red state bills would impose restrictions not only on K-12 teachers, but also on professors in public colleges and universities; PEN counts 48 such bills pending. Last week, Texas\u2019 Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the leader of the state\u2019s social conservatives, said he will push legislation to both end tenure for new hires at the University of Texas and make it easier to revoke tenure for professors who teach critical race theory, an academic analysis that explores structural racism. On another front, Republican-controlled states are pushing beyond race and gender inequities to advance legislation that limits how public schools discuss sexual orientation and gender identity or bars it completely for younger students. The most prominent of these bills \u2013 the Florida legislation that critics have dubbed the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill \u2013 could receive approval from the full state House of Representatives this week, with the enthusiastic support of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. In all, nine states are considering 15 similar bills, according to PEN America. On yet another front, more states and local school districts are banning books, including many by authors who are racial minorities or who identify as LGBTQ: The American Library Association told me in an email that its Office for Intellectual Freedom has received more than 330 reports of attempted book bans from just September through November 2021. Finally, several of the red state education proposals borrow from the new Texas abortion statute and empower private citizens to sue schools or school districts if they object to how teachers discuss the restricted topics. LGBTQ rights: The Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for the LGBTQ community, says 10 states in 2021 adopted 26 bills restricting their rights. One of the most common themes has been legislation prohibiting transgender girls and women from participating in high school and often college-level sports; among the eight states that approved such bans in 2021 were Arkansas, Florida, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. In Republican-controlled states, this wave also shows no sign of cresting: South Dakota recently approved its own ban, proposals are advancing in Kentucky and Utah, and the Human Rights Campaign counts 56 sports bans pending across the states. On a parallel track, Tennessee last year approved legislation requiring students to use the bathrooms for their genders at birth, and Arkansas\u2019 GOP-controlled legislature overrode a veto from Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to approve the nation\u2019s first law prohibiting gender-affirming medical care for transgender people below age 18; Tennessee also approved such a ban. Texas\u2019 GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton issued an opinion last Friday that such treatments constituted \u201cchild abuse\u201d under Texas law. The left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door. People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and \u2026 they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it\u2019s been in their face, so [if it\u2019s] \u2018good for the goose, good for the gander.\u2019 Bill Miller, lobbyist and political consultant in Texas Protest rights: In the aftermath of 2020\u2019s massive Black Lives Matter demonstrations, multiple Republican-controlled states \u2013 including Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas \u2013 have approved laws stiffening penalties on protesters accused of damaging property. In a few cases, red states have also approved laws immunizing drivers who run over protesters if they are caught in demonstrations. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which tracks these proposals, counts more than a dozen that have been approved since 2020, with 17 more pending this year, preponderantly in Republican-controlled states. Gun rights: In sharp contrast to the laws limiting rights across all the arenas discussed above, red states are rushing to loosen restrictions on gun owners. In 2021, five Republican-controlled states, including Montana, Tennessee and Texas, eliminated requirements for gun owners to receive permits or undergo training before being allowed to carry concealed handguns \u2013 or in some cases before being allowed to openly carry weapons, according to tracking by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group. This year the group says seven more Republican-controlled states are moving to eliminate such requirements; three of them (Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina) would allow the open carrying of handguns without any training or permitting. The sweep of this challenge has left civil rights and liberties groups gasping. \u201cWhat is disturbing is how \u2026 many of the legal protections are falling at the same time,\u201d says Archer, the ACLU president. \u201cWe have seen the protection of our civil rights and civil liberties being chipped away, death by a thousand cuts. Today, we are seeing more protections torn down all at once.\u201d Democrats in Washington have found no effective response. The House has passed legislation to reverse many of the state voting restrictions and to codify the national right to abortion, but a Republican Senate filibuster blocked the former last month and is expected to similarly doom the latter next week. Neither the Biden administration nor congressional Democrats have focused much attention on the other state restrictions (particularly the educational \u201cgag orders\u201d), much less devised an approach to resist them. While the red state offensive has advanced, Democrats have been much more consumed by the critique from party centrists that liberals are pushing excessively \u201cwoke\u201d policies on public safety and schooling. Multiple factors probably explain why Republican-controlled states are simultaneously moving so quickly across so many fronts. Anderson, from Heritage Action, says a key factor is that conservative activists have shifted their attention more to state and local governments. That shift has occurred, she says, both because they realize they have few opportunities to advance their priorities at the national level while Democrats control the White House and Congress and also because the Covid-19 crisis made them realize that local decisions \u201cprobably impact their day-to-day [life] more than even federal.\u201d Bill Miller, a lobbyist and political consultant who has worked for both parties in Texas, says the hard push from social conservatives there reflects a long-gestating backlash on the right to the left\u2019s efforts to advance socially liberal causes, such as more explicit discussion of racial issues in the schools. \u201cThe left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door,\u201d he says in a view echoed by Anderson. \u201cPeople got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and \u2026 they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it\u2019s been in their face, so [if it\u2019s] \u2018good for the goose, good for the gander.\u2019 \u201c Others see the key factor as the shifting internal dynamics of the Republican coalition. Particularly in the Trump era, the GOP has become more dominant among the White voters who are the most uneasy about cultural and demographic change. Those voters, energized by Trump, are creating enormous demand in the party for hardline policies on race and culture. There is definitely a difference between action and words. Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. \u2026 These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming. Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer The widespread gerrymandering of state legislative disticts, experts say, has magnified the influence of those voters because it means that almost all GOP lawmakers are running in staunchly conservative districts where they face more risk of losing primaries to opponents on their right than they do of losing general elections to opponents on their left. Murray, the Texas political scientist, says Republican primaries there typically attract only about one-fourth as many voters as the party wins in presidential general elections and those who do turn out \u201care disproportionately the cultural warriors.\u201d Other institutional factors have propelled the rapid dispersion of these ideas across red states. Conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council and Heritage Action energetically encourage Republican legislators to adopt many of these proposals; Heritage, for instance, recently issued a strategy memo urging red state legislatures \u201cto embrace the culture war\u201d over the teaching of race and sexual orientation as a means of building support for vouchers that would provide parents public funds to send their kids to private schools, a perennial goal on the right. The increasing reliance of right-leaning voters on explicitly conservative media sources that relentlessly stoke cultural and racial grievance, from Fox to talk radio, also provides a powerful transmission belt. \u201cThe nationalization of media, aided by social media and the internet, is part of the story,\u201d says Jake Grumbach, a political scientist at the University of Washington and author of an upcoming book on the polarization of state policy. \u201cThis kind of environment means that agendas can be set, with similar talking points and framing, across states very quickly.\u201d Another factor has been the indications from the Republican majority on the Supreme Court that it is unlikely to resist many of these red state initiatives. The red states \u201cfeel completely emboldened by the Supreme Court,\u201d says Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which focuses on state legislative races. In particular, she believes, the court\u2019s \u201clack of action on the Texas case\u201d authorizing private lawsuits against abortions \u201clit a wildfire of socially conservative legislation.\u201d Also critical, many analysts say, is the erosion of resistance from business groups. Under pressure from employees and consumers, business groups often pushed back forcefully during the early stages of this wave \u2013 for instance, with boycotts of North Carolina after Republicans there passed the original \u201cbathroom bill\u201d for transgender individuals in 2016. But apart from modest public criticism of some of the voting laws, business has mostly stood to the side amid this new spasm of socially conservative legislation \u2013 even, critics note, when the bills directly contradict their public claims to support LGBTQ rights or racial equity. The journalist and activist Judd Legum, for instance, has documented that multiple companies that publicly proclaim their support for LGBTQ rights are heavily contributing to the Florida Republican legislators pushing the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill. What the fallout from the Supreme Court's Texas abortion ruling means for the future of Roe \u201cThere is definitely a difference between action and words,\u201d says Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. \u201cLamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. \u2026 These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming.\u201d Republicans in these states also may have been emboldened because Democrats, after making gains in 2018, failed to flip any of the state legislative chambers they targeted in 2020. Now Republicans have been able to fortify their legislative majorities in many states with strong gerrymanders, while Democrats face the headwind of diminished approval ratings for President Joe Biden even among the suburban voters who powered their state-level wins during the Trump years. Like many red state GOP strategists, Austin-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak says, \u201cI do not expect to see a suburban revolt due to the legislature\u2019s [social issue] priorities.\u201d He predicts that Republicans will actually gain in those areas \u201cdue to parental anger at school and Covid overreach.\u201d But perhaps the most powerful reason for this surge of culturally conservative legislation is the force and immediacy of the wave it seeks to counter. The evidence of irreversible demographic and cultural change continues to accumulate: The 2020 census, for the first time, recorded that kids of color now constitute a majority of the nation\u2019s under-18 population; Gallup recently reported that a stunning one-fifth of Generation Z (as well as about 1 in 10 millennials) identifies as LGBTQ; and the latest figures from the Public Religion Research Institute show that White Christians, long the nation\u2019s majority, now compose only a little more than two-fifths of the population. All of that, critics argue, has created a sense of urgency for GOP state legislators responding to voters in their coalition uneasy about the \u201cmore diverse\u201d future \u201cthat is around the corner,\u201d as Martinez Fischer puts it. An America in which no single group makes up a majority \u201cis arriving, and so there\u2019s only two paths,\u201d says Smith of Equality Florida. \u201cOne is division, chaos, suppression, censorship, surveillance and anti-immigrant sentiment. The alternative is a [way] forward, where regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, there is a path here for everyone.\u201d The striking implication of the GOP\u2019s ongoing revolution from below is that the coming decade may see the nation\u2019s 50 states diverge between those two paths more than they have at any point since the Supreme Court and Congress began nationalizing more civil rights and liberties over half a century ago.",

            "article_content": "Kenya Goodson, a 46-year-old Black woman from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, has voted in every election since she was 19. But last week\u2019s Supreme Court decision to allow Alabama\u2019s new congressional map \u2013 which voting rights advocates say dilutes the power of Black voters \u2013 to remain in place has left Goodson, who volunteers to register voters, discouraged about casting a ballot herself. \u201cI was really very hurt, you know, and angry really by the decision by our Supreme Court,\u201d said Goodson, an adjunct professor at the University of Montevallo. \u201cThere are people that are making decisions, not because it\u2019s the law, but they\u2019re making decisions to uphold White supremacy by diluting my vote.\u201d \u201cIt is discouraging because I don\u2019t know what I could do as a citizen to change anything,\u201d she added. Legal challenges are expected to continue in this case, and similar lawsuits have been filed in Texas and Georgia, which will bring the issue of voting rights, racial gerrymandering and discriminatory election practices to the forefront ahead of the midterm elections. The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments over the Alabama map, which could determine the fate of the landmark Voting Rights Act. Goodson said she is still going to vote, and will encourage others to do so, because \u201cour ancestors \u2026 helped us to get this right,\u201d but community organizers worry there could be \u201cdevastating implications\u201d that marginalize Black voters and could, in turn, impact turnout and faith in the democratic process. LaTosha Brown, an Alabama native and founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said this ruling is \u201creally rubber-stamping voter disenfranchisement.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about Alabama,\u201d Brown added. \u201cIt has implications for voter protections around the country.\u201d Felicia Scalzetti, a redistricting organizer for the Alabama Election Protection Network and the Ordinary People Society, told CNN, \u201cThe problem with redistricting is that \u2026 it changes who you can vote for.\u201d \u201cYou can encourage people to turn out all you want,\u201d Scalzetti said. \u201cBut if the slate of people on the ballot do not actually represent your community because your community is cut six ways to Sunday, there\u2019s no amount of turning out that\u2019s going to fix that.\u201d Redistricting is the process of reallocating congressional seats every 10 years based on population changes reflected in the US Census and then redrawing the boundaries of the congressional districts so each has an equal population. In 35 states, the legislature has control over the redistricting process, which raises concerns about the incumbent party manipulating the process in its favor, also known as partisan gerrymandering. In this election cycle, 20 of the 35 states are controlled by Republicans, compared with 11 favoring Democrats, according to the Pew Research Center. Four states have divided governments. 'They know where Black voters live': Challengers say 'race blind' redistricting maps are anything but Similarly, redrawing in terms of race is known as racial gerrymandering. Since voters of color tend to favor Democrats, redistricting driven by party interests or fueled by racial motivation \u2013 whether to curb voters of color or amplify their influence \u2013 go hand in hand. Alabama\u2019s Republican-drawn map gives Black voters the majority in only one of seven districts despite them making up 27% of the population. Thus, the Alabama lawsuit argued that it had been drawn based on race, and used the \u201ccracking\u201d and \u201cpacking\u201d tactics to specifically dilute the power of Black voters. The map lumped areas with high concentrations of Black people together in one district where they could be the majority \u2013 known as packing \u2013 and split up other Black voters in the state so they remain a minority in all other districts \u2013 known as cracking. It will remain in place for the state\u2019s primaries in May. \u201cThe thinking that we could just disenfranchise people at the state level is still here and it still operates a large part of the state\u2019s attitude toward our voting structure,\u201d Dev Wakeley, policy analyst at Alabama Arise, a nonprofit public policy advocacy organization, told CNN. Wakeley and others say the map is a violation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibits any practice that denies or curtails the right to vote based on race. The law included a provision that mandated states with a history of discriminatory practices, which included Alabama, to obtain federal approval before changing electoral practices, but it was struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013. In fact, a lower court unanimously ruled that the new congressional map violates the Voting Rights Act, and the three-judge panel \u2013 which included two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump \u2013 ordered the state to draw another district where Blacks made up a majority of voters or close to it. What the Supreme Court's decision on Alabama's maps could mean for the Voting Rights Act \u201cNo one had any faith that the state of Alabama was going to have voters\u2019 best interests at heart,\u201d Wakeley said. \u201cWe expected a little more of an attempt at a fig leaf by the Supreme Court.\u201d But with a conservative majority and in a 5-4 vote, the Supreme Court allowed the new map to stay in place while the case plays out, and experts say the highest court\u2019s decision \u201csends a very strong signal.\u201d David Canon, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who focuses on redistricting, told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019ll be harder for states to follow what we thought was settled law when it comes to creating minority-majority districts or even influence districts.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to be more of an uphill climb now for anyone to win a voting rights challenge,\u201d he added. \u201cThe sort of anti-democratic ideas that have infested a lot of Alabama decision makers are much more widespread,\u201d Wakeley said. \u201cWhile we might be the sort of sandbox where these terrible policies come into play,\u201d he added, \u201cwe\u2019re far from alone.\u201d Other states have also been accused of intentionally suppressing the vote of communities of color in their redistricting plans. A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting power Mark Gaber, who litigates redistricting cases for the Campaign Legal Center, told CNN, \u201cIt just seems, you know, that wherever the folks in power want to retain their power, they\u2019ll, you know, have no sort of shame about violating voting rights of minorities.\u201d The Campaign Legal Center is a non-profit legal advocacy organization that has filed lawsuits against multiple states for racial and partisan gerrymandering. Texas faces multiple lawsuits, including one filed by the Biden administration in December, for its congressional map, which the Justice Department says does not reflect the state\u2019s growth in minority population. The state was awarded two additional congressional seats due to minority communities, who made up 95% of the state\u2019s overall population growth, but the Justice Department said Texas had drawn the map in a way that the two new seats would be decided by  majority-White voting populations. The Southern Poverty Law Center filed a lawsuit against Georgia last month on behalf of multiple advocacy groups, saying the state\u2019s new congressional map is \u201cits latest assault on the rights of Black voters and other voters of color to participate meaningfully in the democratic process and elect candidates of their choice.\u201d The lawsuit alleges that Georgia, similarly to Alabama, packed voters of color into one district and spread out remaining voters of color to ensure they are the voting minority in two other districts. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very sort of unstable time in this landscape of voting rights law, and also just generally about elections in the country,\u201d Gaber said. \u201cAnd I think the last decade of experience in America proves that now more than ever we need protections for Black and Latino voters.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The pressures of the coronavirus pandemic are reconfiguring the politics of education, dividing Democrats and creating new openings for Republicans. Both sides of that equation will be on display Tuesday in a recall election for three school board members in San Francisco, one of the nation\u2019s most liberal cities. The recall, which has split local Democrats, has combined genuine grassroots discontent over extended school closings during the coronavirus outbreak with massive funding from longtime critics of public education and some big supporters of Republican political campaigns. Divisions among Democrats are also sharpening in the accelerating blue state debates about how quickly to lift school mask mandates and other public health restrictions as coronavirus caseloads plummet nationwide. San Francisco voters set to decide fate of three school board leaders in recall vote Yet these internecine struggles between liberals are obscuring a much more expansive and explosive conflict spreading across the red states: an aggressive drive by Republicans to censor how public school teachers talk about race, gender, sexual orientation and other sensitive topics. That effort amounts to the most intrusive attempt to set legislative limits on the specific content of classroom instruction since the spate of state laws barring the teaching of evolution during the 1920s and the anti-Communist loyalty oaths for teachers that proliferated during the Joe McCarthy era after World War II. Sponsors such as Republican Govs. Glenn Youngkin in Virginia, Ron DeSantis in Florida and Greg Abbott in Texas are advancing these restrictive laws under the banner of \u201cparents\u2019 rights,\u201d attempting to frame them as part of a broader parental demand for greater input after all the uncertainties of school closings and masking and quarantine policies during the long pandemic. Yet many observers, including some critics of how public schools have handled that challenge, say Republicans are trying to divert concerns about safety and student achievement during the pandemic to advance the preexisting goals of culturally conservative, predominantly White parents long resistant to open discussions of race and other controversial topics. Based on the group\u2019s national polling and meetings with parents all over the country, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, says restricting how teachers can talk about race or gender \u201cis really at the bottom of the list\u201d of parental priorities. \u201cThis is political opportunism to hijack this momentum we are seeing from parents and families who are panicked and filled with anxiety and concern,\u201d she says. Results from the latest CNN national poll underscore her perception. While the share of adults who said education would be an important factor in their votes during November\u2019s midterm elections soared past 80%, only about 1 in 4 of them said the content of the curriculum was their major educational concern \u2013 and self-identified Republicans were far more likely to do so than other adults. A bigger share of those who said education would be important to them cited more traditional concerns about the broad social benefits of educating the next generation. \u201cIt is a very small percentage of parents and mostly it is White parents in a position of privilege who are leading that conversation\u201d about restricting classroom content, says Rodrigues. \u201cThese are the same people who are always hogging the mic \u2026 but that is certainly not reflective of the concerns of all parents.\u201d The pandemic has produced arguably the greatest challenge to the operation of the nation\u2019s public schools since the Civil War. As American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten noted in an interview, schools were able to stay open even during major earlier disruptions to American life, such as the Depression and World War II, but they faced unprecedented questions \u2013 and few clear answers \u2013 when the pandemic struck. \u201cWhen did you ever have a situation that we had in March 2020 through June 2020 that schools within a 24-, 48-hour period of time all went remote?\u201d she said. The pressures of adapting to that sudden new reality \u2013 and the long struggle to return to anything approaching normalcy \u2013 have imposed enormous strains on everyone connected to the school system, from administrators and teachers to parents and students. And in that crucible, new fault lines have opened in the politics of education. Two years into the pandemic, the clearest note in public opinion may be that parents, and the public more broadly, want schools open for in-person learning wherever possible. In a January NBC national survey, about two-thirds of all adults, and an even higher percentage of parents of children younger than 18, said they were more concerned about kids falling behind academically from not attending school in person than they were about them spreading Covid-19 during in-person instruction. (Black parents were a notable exception, with a slight majority more concerned about spreading Covid, according to detailed results provided by Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican firm that co-manages the survey.) Should parents be worried if their child's school no longer requires masks? An expert weighs in Frustration over extended school closings was the initial spur for the recall effort against three San Francisco school board members that voters will decide Tuesday. The city kept its schools closed for in-person learning longer than almost any other major jurisdiction. The San Francisco experience shows how the pandemic has divided Democrats: The city under Democratic Mayor London Breed eventually sued the board \u2013 which was engaged in marathon negotiations with the local union over the safety standards for moving teachers back into the classroom \u2013 to force it to reopen the schools; Breed has endorsed the recall effort, which some other progressives in the area oppose. Yet the fight also shows how the left\u2019s disagreements about responding to the pandemic have created new openings for longtime critics of public education on the right: Beyond its grassroots support, the recall movement has attracted substantial funding from conservatives, including William Oberndorf, a close ally of former President Donald Trump\u2019s education secretary, Betsy DeVos. We had this catastrophic failure of our public education system: They were not ready, they were not prepared for this moment and parents had to scramble. We went to the promised land of choices and options \u2026 and now that we have been there, you can\u2019t put that toothpaste back in the tube. Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president, National Parents Union The San Francisco stew is in some respects a miniature of the complex situation nationally: genuine grassroots discontent, Democratic divisions and an aggressive new push from conservatives. As Republicans like Youngkin and DeSantis rally under the banner of \u201cparents\u2019 rights,\u201d a national CBS poll released Sunday, like earlier surveys, found that many parents are indeed concerned about the impact of the pandemic on their kids\u2019 academic and emotional well-being. But in an Ipsos/Axios poll in November, the vast majority of parents of school-age children praised how their schools have balanced health and academic concerns \u2013 a finding that both the National Parents Union and the American Federation of Teachers, which have at times been at odds over the pandemic, say their own private polling has echoed. Polling also belies the perception of a widespread backlash against mask requirements in the schools. Citing declining caseloads, several Democratic governors have recently announced they will rescind mask requirements in the coming weeks for public school students, joining Republican states that either have already revoked their rules or never set them. (California on Monday reaffirmed its school mask requirement at least through the end of February.) Yet the CBS News poll released Sunday found that nearly three-fifths of parents of school-age children still believe that schools should require masks. The broadest movement that has emerged from the pandemic\u2019s turmoil is the effort by Republican-led states to censor how teachers talk about present and historic racial and gender inequities. In 2021, nine Republican-controlled states passed such laws and four others imposed restrictions through state boards of education. This year so many proposals have proliferated that Jeffrey Sachs, a political scientist who tracks the laws for the free speech group PEN America, told me his \u201cgut instinct\u201d is that ultimately all 23 states where Republicans hold unified control of the governorship and state legislature will approve some version of these measures. These proposals are not only expanding to more states but also broadening in their reach. In a news briefing on Monday, PEN America said eight states this year are considering legislation that would limit (or fully prohibit) how teachers and schools talk about sexual orientation and gender identity \u2013 with the most prominent of those efforts the legislation advancing in Florida that critics have dubbed the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill. Other states are proposing to impose greater surveillance on teachers, such as the Iowa bill that would install video feeds in every classroom. Youngkin has established a \u201ctip line\u201d allowing parents or others to charge teachers with improperly addressing \u201cdivisive\u201d topics. Book bans are spreading across red states and school districts as well. Adapting the tactic employed in Texas\u2019 new anti-abortion law, the Florida bills limiting how teachers can talk about race or sexual orientation would authorize private lawsuits by parents against schools. These measures threaten \u201cto turn Florida into a censorship and surveillance state,\u201d Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ rights group, charged in the PEN briefing. DeSantis, who along with Abbott has been among the most visible advocates of these restrictive laws, has defended them as a way of ensuring parental input into the curriculum. \u201cYou have politicians saying parents have no role in the education of their kids. Give me a break,\u201d DeSantis said last week while embracing the \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d legislation. \u201cWe want parents to be able to have access to what\u2019s going on in the classroom.\u201d Avlon on book bans: Don't complain about cancel culture and try to cancel others Yet polling suggests that the demands for restrictions on how schools address race, gender, sexual orientation and other controversial subjects are preponderantly a concern of one group of parents: Republicans. In last week\u2019s national CNN survey, only about 1 in 6 adults thought parents should have the principal say on how schools teach race and only about 1 in 8 thought they should have the most influence either on how history is taught or which books are allowed in school libraries. Big majorities instead thought that authority should be shared among parents, teachers and school officials. Republicans were much more likely than others to argue that parents should have decisive authority, but even among GOP partisans that was a minority position. Sponsors of the laws limiting the teaching of racism tout them as a means of defusing racial conflict. Reihan Salam, president of the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank that has been among the most ardent promoters of these proposals, recently argued that they will promote greater racial harmony. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to build a successful multiethnic democracy, it\u2019ll be because we\u2019ve lowered the salience of race in people\u2019s lives,\u201d he recently declared. But critics of these plans see in them precisely the opposite goal: to suppress the social and political influence of historically marginalized groups that are growing in numbers. These bills to restrict how schools discuss race or sexual orientation are coming precisely as the 2020 census found that kids of color, for the first time, constitute a majority of the under-18 population, and a 2021 Gallup Poll found a far larger percentage of Generation Z (nearly 1 in 6) identifying as part of the LGBTQ community than people in older generations. \u201cThey are attacking any place where they can see the diversity rise,\u201d George Johnson, author of \u201cAll Boys Aren\u2019t Blue,\u201d his 2020 memoir as a gay Black man, which has been banned from school libraries in multiple states, said Monday on the PEN briefing call. Critics of these proposals like Ruthanne Buck, a senior adviser to the Campaign for Our Shared Future, a group opposing them, see proponents operating a kind of \u201cbait and switch\u201d with parents. Focus groups with parents across the ideological spectrum, she says, show the pandemic has in fact exacerbated frustration with the quality of public education. \u201cThe general feeling is that Covid was a final straw to an educational system that was already struggling,\u201d she says. But, echoing the results of the CNN poll, she says those concerns are centered not on whether students are learning too much about controversial subjects, but on academic achievement, the quality of communication between schools and parents, maintaining safety amid the persisting pandemic, and mental health supports for children. \u201cAcross the board, parents do not think state legislators should be passing laws telling public schools what they can and cannot teach,\u201d Buck says. \u201cThey think decisions about education should be left to school boards, parents and teachers. \u2026 We asked what\u2019s the most important thing to you as a parent, and across the board, it was kids being able to think for themselves, show respect for others, think critically.\u201d Weingarten, the American Federation of Teachers president, similarly argues that parents, especially after watching their children learn at the kitchen table during the pandemic\u2019s many months of remote instruction, are legitimately displaying more interest in school curriculums. \u201cOf course, parents have a role,\u201d she says. But she argues that \u201cthere\u2019s a big difference between a gotcha proposal, without any kind of due process, without any kind of guardrails,\u201d such as establishing a tip line for complaints about teachers, and measures that can instill more genuine cooperation, such as \u201chaving open school nights where parents are talking to teachers \u2026 about curriculum.\u201d Weingarten argues that the goal of the bills restricting the teaching of race or sexual orientation is to \u201cchill\u201d classroom discussions of the underlying changes in American society. She likens the wave of restrictions to the measures that Southern states passed in the 1920s barring the teaching of evolution and the requirements for teachers to swear loyalty oaths and avoid teaching critical of the US government during the \u201cred scare\u201d years after World War II. \u201cWe are really backsliding,\u201d she says. \u201cThe exploitation of fear in the aftermath of Covid is being used to try to turn the clock back to the 1950s in this country.\u201d Republicans are tapping into frustrations real and imagined, but we have left a vacuum. We have no reform agenda. Our party is seen as propping up a bureaucratic status quo that many parents thought didn\u2019t perform well during the pandemic. You can\u2019t just point to Republican demagoguery about race and books and win the argument. You have to make voters a counteroffer. Will Marshall, founder and president, Progressive Policy Institute Rodrigues largely agrees with that part of Weingarten\u2019s analysis. The proliferating red state restrictions on teaching \u201care creating a toxic environment for Black and brown children in this country,\u201d she says. But she also says it is a mistake for Democrats and union leaders to ignore the other side of the equation: that a significant number of parents are concerned about the education system\u2019s quality after getting a closer look at it during the pandemic. \u201cWe had this catastrophic failure of our public education system: They were not ready, they were not prepared for this moment and parents had to scramble,\u201d Rodrigues says. \u201cWe went to the promised land of choices and options \u2026 and now that we have been there, you can\u2019t put that toothpaste back in the tube.\u201d Will Marshall, founder and president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a centrist Democratic think tank long critical of teachers\u2019 unions, sees the same dual-edged message for Democrats in the broadening conflicts over education. \u201cRepublicans are tapping into frustrations real and imagined, but we have left a vacuum,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have no reform agenda. Our party is seen as propping up a bureaucratic status quo that many parents thought didn\u2019t perform well during the pandemic. You can\u2019t just point to Republican demagoguery about race and books and win the argument. You have to make voters a counteroffer.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s administration has not set a sharply defined course through these swirling waters. It has consistently advocated for schools to reopen (and won the funding of substantial federal spending to support that), but it has neither identified with the centrist Democrats like Marshall advocating for school reforms to improve student performance nor consistently opposed the restrictions on teaching that are exploding in the red states. (Biden has directly criticized Florida\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t say gay\u201d bill.) Staying mostly on the sidelines may grow less plausible for the President as the education wars escalate from coast to coast \u2013 from the intramural liberal conflict on display Tuesday in San Francisco to the battle between DeSantis and his GOP allies with free speech and LGBTQ rights advocates in Florida. In Covid\u2019s turbulent wake, schools almost everywhere are moving to the front lines of the volatile struggle between what America has been and what it is becoming.",

            "article_content": "A contentious decision from the US Supreme Court in a Voting Rights Act case from Alabama this week previewed what could be a momentous legal battle over the 1965 law, which over the past several years has been repeatedly whittled down by the conservative justices. After lower courts ordered Alabama to redraw a congressional map that they found diluted the strength of Black voters, the state turned to the Supreme Court with aggressive arguments about the reach of the historic law. Alabama secured a 5-4 ruling on Monday night that will reinstate the disputed map for this year\u2019s election. The assertions by Alabama about the role race should play in redistricting are just one of several claims being made by states defending their maps in court that would scale back the scope of the Voting Rights Act \u2013  as Republican-controlled states move to adopt new voting restrictions in key battlegrounds. Some of the GOP states\u2019 arguments appear to go beyond even what a 6-3 conservative court would be willing to sanction. At stake is the role that a provision of the law known as Section 2 will play in combating racially discriminatory maps going forward. The provision prohibits voting procedures \u201cnot equally open to participation by members\u201d of a protected class, like racial minorities, and it has been used to strike down maps said to dilute the power of voters of colors. In response to lawsuits filed in various GOP-led states challenging their maps under Section 2, the states have made a litany of arguments that would limit the use of the Voting Rights Act in redistricting cases. \u201cRepublicans are in a mood where they want to throw mud at the wall,\u201d said Michael Li, a senior counsel for the Democracy Program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center. The Supreme Court did not formally endorse Alabama\u2019s claims. Some justices said their votes were driven by how redrawing the map would disrupt Alabama\u2019s election planning. \u201cThe court took pains to say that this was not a ruling on the merits, so we will take them at their word,\u201d former Attorney General Eric Holder, now the head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, told reporters Thursday. \u201cWe will use Section 2 of the Act in other parts of the country.\u201d Still, even the sole conservative justice to dissent from the move, Chief Justice John Roberts, referenced a \u201cwide range of uncertainties\u201d that have arisen in how courts should approach vote dilution claims brought under the Voting Rights Act. Supreme Court rulings that soften the punch of the act in redistricting could decrease the number of representatives of color in Congress and state legislatures, legal experts say. However, some conservatives have argued that the political shifts in who is electing minority candidates \u2013 with White voters helping to propel several people of color to Congress \u2013 will minimize the impact of such a change in the law. \u201cThis notion that somehow you have to have a majority Black district to elect a Black representative was probably substantially more true in 1965 than it is in 2022,\u201d said Jason Torchinsky, a Republican election lawyer. The arguments Alabama is making are focused on the technical process that courts use to review Voting Rights Act redistricting claims, but they get at the heart of how race should be used as a corrective under the law. If Alabama can convince the Supreme Court to turn away from race consciousness that has historically been deployed in Voting Rights Act vote dilution cases, it will make those cases more difficult for minority voters to bring. \u201cThis comes down to the question of the role of race in drawing districts,\u201d Ben Ginsberg, a former Republican redistricting lawyer, told CNN. Under a 1986 Supreme Court precedent in the case Thornburg v. Gingles, redistricting challenges brought under the Voting Rights Act must pass what\u2019s commonly known as the Gingles test to get courts to strike down a map. According to the test\u2019s first prong, the challengers must prove that there is a relatively compact community of minority voters that could be drawn into a minority-majority district. The second two prongs have to do with racial polarization in voting: Does the minority population vote in a politically cohesive way? And does the racial majority vote as a bloc to defeat the minority voters\u2019 preferred candidates? The Alabama dispute before the Supreme Court targets the first prong, by digging into a tension between Voting Rights Act compliance and the Supreme Court rulings limiting the use of race in redistricting under the Constitution. \u201cThe court has made clear that partisan gerrymanders are not justiciable,\u201d Ginsberg said, referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2019 decision that said federal courts had no role in policing partisan gerrymanders. \u201cIf [the Alabama dispute] portends a race-blind Voting Rights Act, then that restraint on gerrymandering is gone. That would leave little but state law grounds to stop gerrymanderers from implementing their most creative thoughts.\u201d Alabama says that under the Voting Rights Act, states should be required to draw majority-minority districts only in circumstances where a race-blind approach to redistricting would have produced those districts. That means challengers could not use race over other redistricting criteria to prove that the first prong of the Gingles test could be met. \u201cAlabama\u2019s proposal would turn the VRA into a race-blind statute that only looks into what this hypothetical race-blind process would produce,\u201d said Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a Harvard Law professor who specializes in election law. \u201cAnd so the consequence would be just substantially less minority representation in America.\u201d The approach that Alabama is advocating \u201cseems to be reverse-engineered to try to make it harder for plaintiffs to win these cases,\u201d said Rick Hasen, an election law professor at University of California-Irvine. While Alabama is making complicated arguments to the Supreme Court about the technical approach to complying with the Voting Rights Act, Texas is shooting at the moon with its claims about the act\u2019s reach. The Lone Star State signaled in briefs filed in the Justice Department\u2019s redistricting case that Texas will argue to the Supreme Court that Section 2 of the act should not apply in redistricting. Texas already has Justice Clarence Thomas on its side with its claim, as he wrote in a 2017 concurrence and in other cases that he holds that view. That case was heard before former President Donald Trump\u2019s three appointees joined the court, so it is unclear whether any of them would join Thomas. Even if they did, that would still leave Texas one justice short of the five votes it would need for a ruling in favor such an argument. Part of what makes Texas\u2019 argument such a stretch is that it ignores the legislative history of the law, legal experts said. When Congress has renewed the Voting Rights Act in the past, its adjustments to Section 2 have been aimed at how courts should apply it in redistricting. \u201cIf Justice Thomas was right that Section 2 was never intended to apply to redistricting, Congress certainly seemed to think otherwise every time it renewed the act and tweaked the redistricting standards,\u201d Hasen said. A similarly radical argument being made by Texas is that the law does not confer a so-called private cause of action. Texas made the claim in response to the redistricting lawsuit it faces from private civil rights groups challenging its maps. Alabama made the claim as well in earlier stages of its case, but it has abandoned the argument in its appeal to the Supreme Court. If that argument, which was also floated by Georgia in Voting Rights Act redistricting challenges brought there, were endorsed, it would mean that private individuals \u2013 who currently bring the bulk of Section 2 case \u2013 would no longer be able to file such challenges, leaving the law\u2019s enforcement to civil suits brought by the Justice Department. Texas and Alabama pointed to a line from Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s concurrence in the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent Voting Rights Act case, where he, joined by Thomas, said it was an \u201copen question\u201d whether such a private cause of action exists. Legal experts are deeply skeptical that the argument could gain traction with other justices, given that courts \u2013 up to the Supreme Court \u2013 have routinely heard privately brought Section 2 cases, including the case that produced the Gingles test. \u201cThe idea that none of these lawsuits could ever have been brought because private plaintiffs can sue runs against, like literally, the entire history of Section 2,\u201d Stephanopoulos said. Unlike some of the other arguments put forward by GOP states, their claims about how multi-ethnic coalitions should be viewed under the Voting Rights Act would not require the Supreme Court to drastically shift its jurisprudence. States like Texas are arguing that their opponents\u2019 legal challenges should fail because the challengers are asking for minority-majority districts that would combine racial or ethnic minorities to reach a majority. Many lower courts have OK\u2019d Voting Rights Act districts drawn with multi-ethnic coalitions, but some courts haven\u2019t. The Supreme Court hasn\u2019t yet confronted the question directly and if the justices rejected the use of multi-ethnic coalitions, the \u201cSupreme Court wouldn\u2019t have to adopt total outlier position,\u201d Stephanopoulos said. In the Texas case, the state is claiming that the Voting Rights Act does not require Texas to create a minority-majority district by combining Black and Hispanic voters, as the challengers are seeking to do in the state. The impact of such a ruling would be less extreme than one that embraced GOP states\u2019 more sweeping arguments. Coalition districts are already tough to assemble under the Voting Rights Act because, under the Gingles test, those different ethnic groups must exhibit shared political preferences. \u201cIt\u2019s not like the court saying, \u2018You can\u2019t have the rainbow coalition,\u2019 would affect a lot of districts and would overturn existing understandings,\u201d Hasen said. \u201cI think there\u2019s just an uncertainty about that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court\u2019s action late Monday in an Alabama redistricting case foreshadows a new threat to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and electoral opportunities for Blacks and other racial minorities nationwide. The justices announced they would revisit a key section of the landmark law in upcoming months and in a 5-4 vote reinstated an Alabama congressional map that a lower court found had diluted the voting power of Blacks in the state. Led by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority in 2013 eviscerated a key section of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before changing election rules. Supreme Court lets GOP-drawn Alabama congressional map that critics say dilutes power of Black voters stay in place The new controversy could lead to a further hollowing out of a separate provision \u2013 known as Section 2 and barring practices that racially discriminate \u2013 specifically in the context of redistricting maps. Combined, the court\u2019s actions could mean the reach of the Voting Rights Act is dramatically limited by the 2024 presidential election. This latest voting rights controversy arises against a broader erosion in America of democratic norms and a polarized electorate. States have increasingly adopted new restrictions for the polls, and federal legislation to safeguard voting rights has stalled in Congress. The conservatives who control today\u2019s court have consistently enhanced states\u2019 control over election practices, while diminishing opportunities for federal oversight and judicial safeguards. In a case from Arizona last year, the justices narrowed the reach of Section 2 as they upheld policies requiring ballots cast by people at the wrong precinct to be wholly discarded and criminalizing third-party collection of absentee ballots, such as at nursing homes. The three liberal justices dissented Monday and warned that if the Supreme Court fully accepts Alabama\u2019s legal rationale for opposing a second majority-Black district in the state, it \u201cwould rewrite decades of this Court\u2019s precedent\u201d that has given racial minorities an equal opportunity to participate in elections. Alabama\u2019s population is 27% Black, and the state legislature created a map that would provide Blacks the opportunity to elect their preferred candidate in only one of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts. By allowing the state to use that map, Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, the court \u201cdoes a disservice to Black Alabamians who under that precedent have had their electoral power diminished \u2013 in violation of a law this Court once knew to buttress all of American democracy.\u201d The surprising liberal consensus emerging about Biden's Supreme Court decision The court\u2019s acceptance of the Alabama dispute means the justices will begin the 2022-23 session next October with two racially charged controversies on its agenda. The justices recently announced they would hear lawsuits against race-based affirmative action practices at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. RELATED: The 3 Supreme Court justices to watch after Breyer retires Today\u2019s Supreme Court majority is plainly exerting its right-wing muscle with three new appointees of former President Donald Trump. In the current 2021-22 session that will run through June, the court already has signaled a willingness to plow through precedent related to abortion rights, gun control and religious liberties. A test of the Clean Air Act will be heard later this month as well. The scope of the historic Voting Rights Act has been a recurring agenda item for the high court under Roberts\u2019 leadership. In earlier decades, the high court upheld the sweep of the law, passed by Congress in the wake of the \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d violence in Alabama. On March 7, 1965, state troopers with clubs and bullwhips attacked civil rights demonstrators crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. In a significant departure from prior court rulings, the justices in 2013 ended the VRA Section 5 requirement that states and other localities with a history of race discrimination obtain federal approval for any electoral changes. Taking the lead for a 5-4 majority, Roberts wrote that the problems that so-called Section 5 was designed to correct no longer existed. The 3 Supreme Court justices to watch after Breyer retires \u201cOur country has changed,\u201d Roberts wrote. That 5-4 decision in Shelby County v. Holder left intact Section 2, related to direct government discrimination, but the majority now appears poised to curtail its coverage in redistricting. Monday\u2019s paired cases, Merrill v. Milligan and Merrill v. Caster, involved Section 2 challenges to a congressional map drawn by the Republican-controlled state legislature. After Black voters and civil rights advocates challenged the seven-district congressional map as discriminatory, a US three-judge district court ruled that it diluted the votes of the Black votes under Section 2\u2019s prohibition on practices that deny a person the right to vote on account of race. The three-judge court said a second majority-Black district was possible, based on traditional redistricting criteria tied to the size of a population and their geographical compactness. The judges concluded in their decision that, \u201cunder the totality of the circumstances, including the factors that the Supreme Court has instructed us to consider, Black voters have less opportunity than other Alabamians to elect candidates of their choice to Congress.\u201d New York completes congressional redistricting, likely netting Democrats several seats As the Supreme Court on Monday restored the original map with only one Black-majority district and agreed to hear the legal merits of the case next session, the majority declined to explain its rationale. Roberts separately dissented, saying he believed the lower court\u2019s map, and a second-Black majority district, should have permitted for the 2022 election cycle while the justices resolved the larger questions and set standards for future elections. But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a concurring statement saying he believed it was too close to the upcoming midterm congressional elections in Alabama to replace the legislature\u2019s map. He warned of possible \u201cchaos and confusion\u201d leading up to the May primary and November general election. Also in the majority were Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. Regarding the timing of the case, Kagan countered for the three liberal dissenters, \u201cAlabama is not entitled to keep violating Black Alabamians\u2019 voting rights just because the court\u2019s order came down in the first month of an election year.\u201d In his dissent, Roberts referred to the comprehensive lower court decision: \u201cIn my view,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe District Court properly applied existing law in an extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction.\u201d Based on the standards of a 1986 case, Roberts said, the Blacks and advocacy groups challenging the Alabama map demonstrated the need for the second Black-majority district. But Roberts also said that the 1986 precedent governing the dispute, Thornburg v. Gingles, and related rulings \u201chave engendered considerable disagreement and uncertainty regarding the nature and contours of a vote dilution claim.\u201d As a result, Roberts endorsed the majority\u2019s decision to hear the Alabama controversy. \u201c(S)ubsequent elections,\u201d the chief justice wrote, \u201cwould be governed\u201d by the Court\u2019s final decision in the dispute, likely to handed down in 2023. Alabama state lawyers have advocated for a greater use of race-neutral criteria in redistricting. Kagan and the other liberal dissenters said their arguments were \u201cpremised on an entirely new view of what the law requires\u201d and would likely lead to fewer districts where minority voters are able to elect their preferred candidates. Takeaways from the $2.3 million Ruth Bader Ginsburg library auction \u201cThe District Court here did everything right under the law existing today,\u201d she continued. \u201cStaying its decision forces Black Alabamians to suffer what under that law is clear vote dilution.\u201d On the special US district court that ruled on January 24 in the case were US appellate Judge Stanley Marcus, appointed by President Bill Clinton, and US District Court Judges Anna Manasco and Terry Moorer, appointed by President Donald Trump. In concluding that Blacks merited a second majority-Black congressional district because of their population and location, the judges also took account of another element for a Section 2 violation, \u201cthat voting in the challenged districts is intensely racially polarized.\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d the judges added, \u201cis not genuinely in dispute.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, allowed a congressional map drawn by Alabama Republicans to remain in place Monday, freezing a lower court ruling that said the map likely violates the Voting Rights Act by diluting the political power of Black voters. The lower court had ordered a new map to be drawn, which could have led to Democrats gaining another seat in the House in the fall. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the three liberal justices in dissent. The justices also said they would hear arguments over the map, adding another potentially explosive issue \u2013 concerning the scope of a key provision of the Voting Rights Act \u2013 to the court\u2019s docket. The court\u2019s order, the first dealing with the 2022 elections, means that the map will be used for the state\u2019s upcoming primary, and likely be in place for the entire election cycle, while the legal challenge plays out. The order pauses an opinion by a panel of three judges that held that the Alabama map likely violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it only includes one district where Black voters have the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing for himself and fellow conservative Justice Samuel Alito, said the court acted in order to maintain the status quo while the justices consider the issue. Kavanaugh said the court\u2019s order \u201cdoes not make or signal any change\u201d to voting rights law. But Roberts, who again found himself siding with the court\u2019s three liberals, said that while he agreed the court should take up the issue for next term to \u201cresolve the wide ranging uncertainties\u201d in the case, he would have allowed the district court opinion to stand while the appeals process played out. The Supreme Court will hear the full case next fall. \u201cThe District Court properly applied existing law in an extensive opinion with no apparent errors for our correction,\u201d Roberts wrote. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for her liberal colleagues Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, wrote a much more strongly worded dissent. Kagan said the majority had gone \u201cbadly wrong\u201d in granting Alabama\u2019s request to freeze the lower court opinion and the court\u2019s decision \u201cforces Black Alabamians to suffer what under the law is clear vote dilution.\u201d She said the decision will undermine a key section of the Voting Rights Act. She also said the court shouldn\u2019t issue such an impactful order on its emergency docket (which critics refer to as its \u201cshadow docket\u201d) without full briefing and oral argument. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is one more in a disconcertingly long line of cases in which this Court uses its shadow docket to signal or make changes in the law, without anything approaching full briefing and argument,\u201d she said. She said the court\u2019s action \u201cdoes a disservice\u201d to Black Alabamians who \u201chave had their electoral power diminished \u2013 in violation of a law this court once knew to buttress all of American democracy.\u201d Alabama\u2019s congressional redistricting plan was challenged under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, a VRA provision that has been a crucial tool for voting rights advocates after the Supreme Court gutted another section of the law that required certain states to get federal approval for its maps. The lower court panel, which included two judges appointed by former President Donald Trump, said that Alabama was required to draw a second district where Blacks made up a majority of voters or close to it. Their decision pointed to Supreme Court precedent for how VRA redistricting cases should be handled. Before Monday\u2019s ruling, US Rep. Mo Brooks complained to Alabama.com that \u201cskin pigmentation\u201d should not factor into the congressional redistricting process. \u201cThese liberal activist judges have tried to segregate us based on race, I find that abominable, in order to elect people in certain parts of the state based on race, which I also think is abominable. We\u2019ve got to put the skin pigmentation issue behind us,\u201d the Alabama Republican told the outlet Saturday, remarking later on \u201cthe concept that Blacks can only be elected in Black districts, and Whites should have districts of their own in which they get elected. I believe that is racist and I oppose it.\u201d Alabama, in seeking the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention, had argued that race had been improperly used in the proceedings to determine whether Alabama was obligated under the law to draw a second minority-majority district. Alabama, in its arguments to the court, is asking the Supreme Court to \u201ccut back significantly on the scope of Section (Two of) the Voting Rights Act in redistricting cases,\u201d Rick Hasen, an election law expert, wrote in an analysis of the case last week. \u201cA cutback could have major negative implications for African-American and other racial minority representation in Congress, in state legislatures, and in local bodies across the country, making it harder to require jurisdictions to draw districts where minority voters can elect representatives of their choice,\u201d Hasen, a law professor at University of California-Irvine, wrote on the election law blog.

            "article_content": "FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday defended the bureau against right-wing claims that it is pursuing cases against people who participated in the January 6, 2021, insurrection more aggressively than it is for rioters who attacked private and public buildings during racial justice protests in 2020. Wray, noting that the FBI has opened hundreds of investigations in connection to both the US Capitol attack and the riots that were sparked by the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police in 2020, said that \u201cthere are some differences, though,\u201d in how the bureau has been able to investigate the events.. \u201cIn the January 6 instance, it happened in broad daylight and it\u2019s been photographed extensively, people\u2019s faces eminently visible, and involved a fairly unmistakable breach and entry into the Congress while they were in the middle of conducting one of their most sacred responsibilities,\u201d Wray said during an event at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. The Justice Department has charged more than 700 people in connection with the attack on the Capitol meant to disrupt the confirmation of Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 presidential election on behalf of then-President Donald Trump However, at least half of the charges have been misdemeanors, the lowest-level petty offenses available to the department. The riots in spurred by protests to Floyd\u2019s murder largely involved protesters attacking empty federal buildings and private business in cities like Portland, Oregon, and Minneapolis. Two Trump-appointed judges reject comparisons between January 6 and Portland unrest Wray noted that in the 2020 riots, there is less federal jurisdiction that would have allowed the Justice Department to bring charges for attacks on private property and many rioters have simply been harder to find because they concealed themselves. \u201cWe are aggressively pursuing both,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have one standard, which is you don\u2019t get to commit violence. \u201d The comments come as some people on the right, including several January 6 defendants, have claimed that the administration has created two justice systems for the separate incidents, charging that their conservative politics are fueling a more intense response compared to how left-leaning rioters are being treated. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Republican and one Trump\u2019s strongest allies in Congress, told reporters Monday that there should not be a \u201cdouble standard\u201d in how the different rioters are treated by the courts. \u201cThe rule of law is blind, right? So when you commit a crime, you should pay for that crime, wherever it was done,\u201d he said. Some of the claims raised against the government by January 6 defendants have been rejected in court by at least two Trump-appointed federal judges. In December, Judges Trevor McFadden and Carl Nichols both said the Capitol riot defendants\u2019 arguments didn\u2019t have enough evidence to show discrimination. In one case, McFadden refused defendant David Lee Judd\u2019s request for the judge to dig into Justice Department records about prosecution decisions in Portland and DC, claiming he was being treated unfairly compared with similar defendants on the West Coast. McFadden explained that the Portland riots didn\u2019t have the same severe consequences as the attempted coup on January 6, pointing out that although the Portland rioters attacked federal buildings, they \u201cprimarily attacked at night, meaning that they raged against a largely vacant courthouse,\u201d while the Capitol rioters jeopardized the safety of members of Congress and their staff.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump teased a 2024 White House bid over the weekend while also spewing a raft of election lies and January 6 revisionism. His comments \u2013 both at a campaign-style rally in Texas on Saturday and in a Sunday evening statement \u2013 drew some rare GOP pushback but also underscored the legal and political challenges Trump faces more than a year after his 2020 election loss. Here\u2019s what you need to know: January 6. Trump said at his Texas rally that he would consider pardoning those who were charged in connection with the deadly January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol if he wins the White House again. \u201cIf I run and if I win, we will treat those people from January 6 fairly. We will treat them fairly,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd if it requires pardons, we will give them pardons. Because they are being treated so unfairly.\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s allies in Congress have pleaded for pardons for rioters. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a potential 2024 Republican presidential contender, recently called one-year commemorations of the Capitol riot an effort to \u201csmear\u201d Trump\u2019s supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace. It\u2019s a disgrace,\u201d Trump said of the prosecutions and prison sentences rioters have faced. The Department of Justice has charged more than 700 in connection with the attack on the Capitol. Financial and elections probes. The former President also used the speech to rail against New York prosecutors\u2019 investigations into his business empire, calling for \u201cthe biggest protests we have ever had\u201d if the prosecutors \u201cdo anything wrong or illegal.\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James earlier this month laid out details of what her office believes to be \u201cmisleading or fraudulent\u201d financial statements. And Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has vowed to personally focus on a probe into Trump\u2019s business practices. Both prosecutors \u2013 whom Trump called \u201cracists\u201d \u2013 are Black, and neither has faced credible accusations of misconduct. \u201cThese prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They\u2019re racists, and they\u2019re very sick \u2013 they\u2019re mentally sick,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re going after me without any protection of my rights from the Supreme Court or most other courts. In reality, they\u2019re not after me, they\u2019re after you.\u201d Trump also alluded to the potential legal peril he\u2019s facing in Fulton County, Georgia, where District Attorney Fani Willis has been granted a special grand jury to examine his attempt to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 win in the state. In a sign of the potential impact of Trump\u2019s incitement, Willis wrote to the FBI on Sunday asking for an immediate risk assessment for the Fulton County Courthouse and government buildings. Election lies. In a Sunday evening statement, Trump said that he wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the 2020 presidential election, repeating the false claim that Pence had the power to do so and slamming recent bipartisan efforts to reform the Electoral Count Act. The former President falsely claimed that a bipartisan group of lawmakers working to reform the Electoral Count Act proves his claim that Pence had the power, according to the ECA, to overturn the 2020 election. Though the Act is vague, it is clear the role of the vice president is ceremonial and does not include the power to overturn the result of a presidential election. \u201cActually, what they are saying, is that Mike Pence did have the right to change the outcome, and they now want to take that right away. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t exercise that power, he could have overturned the Election!\u201d Trump falsely claimed. Trump\u2019s suggestion that he could pardon participants of the January 6 attack in particular drew sharp backlash from lawmakers, including some Republicans. One of Trump\u2019s closest allies, Sen. Lindsey Graham, dismissed the promise of pardons in an appearance on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI think it\u2019s inappropriate. I don\u2019t want to reinforce that defiling the Capitol was OK. I don\u2019t want to do anything that would make this more likely in the future,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire said similarly on iSunday, \u201cThe folks that were part of the riots and, frankly, the assault on the US Capitol, have to be held accountable. There is a rule of law.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care whether you were part of burning cities in Antifa in 2020 or storming the Capitol in 2021, everybody needs to be held fairly accountable across,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d appearing to refer to violence tied to racial justice protests in 2020. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be pardoned?\u201d Bash asked, referring to the Capitol rioters. \u201cOf course not. Oh my goodness, no,\u201d Sununu said. Trump\u2019s comments also drew criticism from Maine\u2019s Susan Collins, who was one of seven GOP senators who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial for his role in inciting the insurrection. \u201cI do not think the President should have made \u2026 that pledge to do pardons,\u201d she told ABC News on Sunday. \u201cWe should let the judicial process proceed. January 6 was a dark day in our history.\u201d Additionally, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Trump\u2019s comments served as \u201ca reminder of how unfit he is for office.\u201d \u201cSo, in terms of the former President, his actions represent a unique and existential threat to our democracy, as the President has said many times,\u201d Psaki told reporters at Monday\u2019s press briefing. \u201cBut you know, his remarks this weekend, he defended the actions of his supporters who stormed the Capitol and brutally attacked the law enforcement officers protecting it. I think it\u2019s important to shout that out and call that out. He even attacked his own vice president for not in his words, having overturned the election,\u201d she added. While Trump did not explicitly say he will run for President in 2024 \u2013 doing so would trigger a series of legal and campaign finance requirements \u2013 he vowed, \u201cWe are going to take back the White House.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner, Devan Cole and Stephen Collinson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney is asking for the FBI\u2019s help in providing security for buildings and staff one day after former President Donald Trump called prosecutors investigating him \u201cracists\u201d and said his supporters should hold \u201cthe biggest protests we have ever had\u201d in cities like Atlanta if the prosecutors \u201cdo anything wrong or illegal.\u201d DA Fani Willis and her office are investigating Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. A special grand jury will be seated as part of that investigation on May 2. Trump offers chilling glimpse into possible second term At a rally in Conroe, Texas, Saturday night, Trump, without naming them, railed against Willis plus New York Attorney General Letitia James and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg Jr., who are investigating his business empire, calling them \u201cracists.\u201d The three are Black. Trump provided no evidence of racial discrimination. \u201cThese prosecutors are vicious, horrible people. They\u2019re racists and they\u2019re very sick \u2013 they\u2019re mentally sick,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re going after me without any protection of my rights from the Supreme Court or most other courts. In reality, they\u2019re not after me, they\u2019re after you.\u201d In a letter to J.C. Hacker, FBI special agent in charge of the Atlanta field office, Willis asked for a risk assessment of buildings surrounding her office and the courthouse where the grand jury will sit. She also asked for FBI agents to provide security, saying \u201csecurity concerns were escalated this weekend\u201d by Trump\u2019s rhetoric. Willis said her office had already received communications from people unhappy with the investigation before Trump\u2019s rally. \u201cI am asking that you immediately conduct a risk assessment of the Fulton County Courthouse and Government Center, and that you provide protective resources to include intelligence and federal agents,\u201d Willis said in the letter, obtained by CNN. \u201cIt is imperative that these resources are in place well in advance of the convening of the Special Purpose Grand Jury.\u201d CNN has reached out to the FBI in Atlanta for comment. Plans to close all but one polling place in a rural Georgia county reverberate through a battleground state Willis, a Democrat, compared potential violence associated with her investigation to the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. Trump said Saturday night that he would consider pardoning those who were charged in connection with the deadly attack if he wins the White House again. Several high-profile Republicans, including New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, quickly dismissed Trump\u2019s suggestion. \u201cWe must work together to keep the public safe and ensure that we do not have a tragedy in Atlanta similar to what happened at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,\u201d Willis said.",

            "article_content": "After a lousy Election Day in November, a moderate House Democrat crystallized her party\u2019s anxiety with a swipe at President Joe Biden. \u201cNobody elected him to be F.D.R.,\u201d Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, who faces a tough reelection battle, told The New York Times. \u201cThey elected him to be normal and stop the chaos.\u201d Her remarks suggested a multi-count indictment: that Biden had entered the White House with a singular mandate, abandoned it for left-wing policy aspirations, and thus split and paralyzed the Democratic-controlled Congress. That charge of ideological hubris has gained considerable currency since. But it obscures a more compelling explanation for Democratic woes: It\u2019s hard to act alone on major national problems with threadbare congressional majorities. Like all presidents, Biden won his office for multiple reasons. Many of his 81 million voters surely wanted him just to replace Donald Trump\u2019s divisiveness with calm and tame the pandemic. But many others cheered his calls to lift struggling middle-class families, respond to climate change or temper racial injustice. They included Spanberger herself. If Democrats can't pass their agenda now, they may not get another chance for years. Here's why \u201cI want a president who will hear the struggles of the parent working to make ends meet \u2026 the young adult saddled with debt \u2026 the senior who rations his medication,\u201d Spanberger wrote in endorsing Biden\u2019s candidacy in March 2020. During the general election, Biden invoked FDR while proposing trillions in new domestic spending. He did the same in his April 2021 address to Congress, which Spanberger praised for its vision of \u201can America that lives up to its promise of opportunity for everyone.\u201d Far from fracturing his party, Biden drew near-unanimous support for major early initiatives. On the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and the $3.5 trillion budget resolution setting the stage for his Build Back Better climate and social policy bill, Democratic leaders drew more than 97% of their House members and 100% of their senators. That\u2019s typical for new presidents. They require overwhelming party support on top-tier priorities since the opposition, in a highly polarized political system, tends to view them as anathema. It\u2019s not always unanimous support. Trump lost three Senate Republicans on his 2017 push to repeal the Affordable Care Act - enough to kill the effort. President Bill Clinton lost six Senate Democrats on his 1993 economic plan but held the other 50 to pass it with Vice President Al Gore\u2019s tie-breaking vote. To give Vice President Kamala Harris that same opportunity, however, Biden must hold all 50 Senate Democrats. One of them, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, represents a constituency that favored Trump by 39 percentage points in 2020. In theory, support from Republicans could overcome stray defections. On the infrastructure bill and legislation to expand domestic production of microchips, Biden has drawn some Republican backing. But on voting rights and Build Back Better \u2013 where he has come up short \u2013 that\u2019s simply not possible. Republicans have come to view broader ballot access as a mortal threat. The GOP resists even acknowledging climate change, much less acting to curb it. It unyieldingly opposes tax increases to finance more social spending. That gives unilateral veto power to all 50 Senate Democrats. On Build Back Better, Manchin has wielded it. Battered White House searches for a Biden comeback scenario That 2% of the Democratic caucus can thwart the remaining 98% does not mean the party has split between moderate and conservative factions. It means the White House is vulnerable to the tiniest splinter. \u201cThe Democrats are remarkably unified around a broad social policy agenda,\u201d said Sarah Binder, a scholar of legislative politics at George Washington University. \u201cIt looks like they\u2019re fractured and divided because of those remarkably slim margins. It is bad historical luck that their 50th vote is Joe Manchin of West Virginia.\u201d Manchin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who at various points has also used her veto, do not constitute a recognizable ideological faction in any event. The more conservative Manchin, for example, is willing to raise the corporate income tax rate to 25% from 21%; the more idiosyncratic Sinema won\u2019t accept raising it a single point. That makes it harder to craft a package that doesn\u2019t increase the federal budget deficit, something Manchin insists upon. Democratic leaders have cut the original Build Back Better outline, itself smaller than what Biden campaigned on, in half. It now bears no resemblance to the Green New Deal of Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the \u201cMedicare for All\u201d plan of Vermont\u2019s Sen. Bernie Sanders or the wealth tax of Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2013 none of whom has moved to stop it. So the question is less whether a Democratic-controlled Congress can pass the agenda of the \u201cradical left,\u201d as Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell calls it, than whether it can take any major steps at all to respond to climate change and narrowing economic opportunity. Manchin clarified that reality with his surprise December announcement halting talks over Build Back Better. For at least one frustrated House moderate, it redirected discontent from the President\u2019s ambition to the West Virginian\u2019s recalcitrance. \u201cOne Democratic U.S. Senator has now summarily walked away from productive negotiations,\u201d Spanberger said in a statement. \u201cThat is unacceptable, and we cannot act like this moment is the end. Children, families, and the future of our planet are counting on us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer are scheduled to appear together at the White House on Thursday as the 83-year-old justice is set to announce his retirement, a source familiar with the plan tells CNN. Breyer conveyed to the White House last week that he planned to step down from the court, but he did not tell Biden directly. As of Tuesday, the White House had yet to formally receive a letter from Breyer making his intentions official, the source said. A time and location for Thursday\u2019s event have not been announced. After news broke on Wednesday of Breyer\u2019s intentions to step down, the White House said Biden remains committed to nominating the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. The prospect of the historic Supreme Court nomination takes place at a crucial political moment for the Biden White House. With the 2022 midterm elections on the horizon and a myriad of policy battles playing out in Washington, the confirmation of a liberal justice could be the major win Democrats need to fire up their base this November. White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters during a news briefing on Wednesday that Biden \u201chas stated and reiterated his commitment to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court and certainly stands by that.\u201d But she had no additional details or statements about the news of Breyer\u2019s retirement. Breyer will be leaving the high court after two decades on the bench, and Biden\u2019s pick to replace him is expected be a younger, fellow liberal who could serve on the court for decades. It\u2019ll be the President\u2019s first chance to nominate someone to the high court. While confirmation timelines vary, Democrats have signaled thus far that a prospective Supreme Court justice\u2019s confirmation process would take place swiftly if Biden put forward a nominee. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday vowed that a Biden nominee will be confirmed with \u201call deliberate speed.\u201d The confirmation of justices typically takes months. But during the last Supreme Court vacancy, Republicans, as they were barreling toward the 2020 election, pushed through Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s nomination in less than a month. Despite confirmation delays over the course of Biden\u2019s first year in office, Senate Democrats are confident that a Supreme Court nominee will receive enough votes to get confirmed, according to senior Democratic sources. The President also declined to weigh in on the news of Breyer\u2019s retirement from the court on Wednesday, deferring to Breyer, personally, for any news. \u201cEvery justice has the right to decide what he or she is going to do, and announce that on their own,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThere\u2019s been no announcement from Justice Breyer. Let him make whatever statement he is going to make, and I\u2019ll be happy to talk about it later.\u201d Biden had said throughout his 2020 presidential campaign that he was committed to nominating a Black woman to the Supreme Court if elected. \u201cI (have) committed that, if I\u2019m elected as president and have the opportunity to appoint someone to the courts, I\u2019ll appoint the first Black woman to the court. It\u2019s required that they have representation now \u2014 it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d Biden said in March 2020. A short list of potential nominees had been circulating Washington well before Breyer\u2019s retirement plans became public, and officials in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office built files on various candidates in anticipation of a potential vacancy. Names on the list include: DC Circuit Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger, South Carolina US District Judge J. Michelle Childs, North Carolina Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, Minnesota US District Judge Wilhelmina \u201cMimi\u201d Wright, Circuit Judge Eunice Lee, Circuit Judge Candace Jackson-Akiwumi and Sherrilyn Ifill, a civil rights attorney who recently announced plans to step down from her role as president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. On Wednesday, Psaki declined to comment on rumors that Vice President Kamala Harris could be considered for a Supreme Court vacancy. However, she reiterated that the President has every intention on \u201crunning for reelection with Vice President Harris on the ticket as his partner.\u201d The prospective nomination of a Black woman to the high court is also a chance for Biden to make amends to progressives for his previous handling of Supreme Court nominations while serving in the Senate. As a senator, Biden presided over six Supreme Court confirmation hearings, including Robert Bork\u2019s failed nomination. Biden was the senator in charge of shepherding Breyer\u2019s nomination process as well. Most notable, however, was Biden\u2019s role presiding over the confirmation hearings for Clarence Thomas when the then-Delaware senator was the chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The hearings for Thomas\u2019 nomination included Anita Hill\u2019s testimony alleging that Thomas, who was her boss at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, had sexually harassed her. In 2019, as Biden was preparing for a presidential run, he said he regretted that he didn\u2019t give Hill, a Black woman, the \u201chearing she deserved.\u201d He said that hearing would have been one \u201cwhere she was respected, where the tone of the questioning was not hostile and insulting.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cshe paid a terrible price \u2013 she was abused through the hearing, she was taken advantage of, her reputation was attacked.\u201d Biden also acknowledged the racial dynamics at play, saying there was a \u201creal and perceived problem the committee faced: There were a bunch of white guys\u201d on the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing for Hill\u2019s testimony. As a result of that dynamic, he said, \u201cShe faced a committee that didn\u2019t fully understand what the hell it was all about.\u201d Later that year, Biden had a conversation with Hill in which he shared \u201chis regret for what she endured.\u201d Hill, in an interview with The New York Times, declined to call the conversation an apology and said she thought Biden failed to grasp the damage he did to her and other victims of sexual harassment.

            "article_content": "People cite a familiar cast of villains when they talk about the decline of democracy in America. Some point to the GOP legislators who craft voter suppression bills. Others blame those who spread the \u201cBig Lie\u201d that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Some even mention the two Democratic Senators who doomed voting rights legislation this week because they would not alter the filibuster. But there is someone most people rarely mention when talking about roadblocks to voting or the decline of democracy, says legal analyst Elie Mystal: Chief Justice John Roberts. Mystal, one of the most sought-after legal analysts in the country and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cAllow Me to Retort: A Black Guy\u2019s Guide to the Constitution,\u201d sat down with CNN for a recent Q&A on race, voting rights and the decline of democracy in the US. Mystal says people can\u2019t talk about these issues without talking about Roberts\u2019 central role in removing federal oversight of elections to allow unfettered voter suppression to become normalized. Roberts\u2019 majority opinion in the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision was a crucial milestone in his decades-long campaign to turn back racial progress, Mystal says. The 1965 Voting Rights Act was passed to prevent local and state governments from adopting laws that denied citizens the equal right to vote based on race. The Shelby decision gutted the law by allowing states with a history of racial discrimination to change their election practices without getting approval from the federal government. \u201cHis [Roberts\u2019] opinion purposefully opened the door to all manner of voting rights restrictions,\u201d Mystal writes. \u201cWhen you see lines of Black people waiting hours and hours to vote, you can largely thank John Roberts for these scenes of racism. And he hasn\u2019t gotten nearly enough blame for it.\u201d A spokesperson for Roberts did not respond to a CNN request for comment on Mystal\u2019s remarks. Such blunt talk by Mystal is characteristic of his new book, which is a lively, pugnacious, and accessible look at the legal theories that shape everything from voting to gun rights. Mystal says he wrote it to show Americans \u201cwhat rights we have\u201d and \u201cwhat rights Republicans are trying to take away.\u201d Here are excerpts from our interview with Mystal. His answers have been edited for brevity and clarity. What will be the fallout now that Democrats failed to pass a voting rights bill? The Republican Party has no agenda. No way of appealing to Black voters and minority voters across the country. Their only strategy is to suppress the minority vote. Now that the Democrats have failed to pass voting rights legislation, what they have effectively done is rubber-stamp the Republican strategy of suppressing the minority vote. The Republicans never leave their base out in the cold. Republicans always give their base red meat, something for them to get excited about every election. Whereas the Democrats never give their base, which happens to be Black and brown voters, anything to be pumped up and excited about during their governing years. And then two or three months right before the election, they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh yeah, by the way, you guys got to come vote and save the party.\u2019 Black people can\u2019t save the country if Democrats don\u2019t let us. If you don\u2019t put the laws in place to protect our right to vote, then the 14 or 15% of us can\u2019t save America from its White, right-wing theocracy. What does it mean for the country, and for democracy itself, now that the voting rights bill has been defeated? It\u2019s hard for me to not think of it kind of holistically, because not allowing Black people to participate in the polity is as American as apple pie. This country was founded on an apartheid system of government. They fought a war over slavery \u2013 the losing side won the peace. And while they were not able to reinstitute slavery, they were able to reinstitute segregation and oppression and an apartheid government. The 15th Amendment, which says you can\u2019t discriminate against people voting based on the color of their skin, meant nothing for 100 years because there was no law to back it up. Without a statute, a constitutional amendment is more like a suggestion. It has no enforcement kick. There was no statute passed to make the gains of the Fifteenth Amendment real. That\u2019s why I said the 1965 Voting Rights Act is the most important piece of legislation in American history. It is the first and only piece of legislation that makes the 15th Amendment real in this country. That is why Republicans have been trying take it away pretty much since its start. So when we say what is the effect on the country now that Democrats failed to pass voting rights legislation \u2013 the country will just do what the country has always done, which is oppress the voice and political opportunity of African Americans and minorities writ large in this country. We will be going backwards. In your new book, you say something that stood out to me: \u201cThe Constitution was designed to create a society dominated by White males.\u201d Not all the Founding Fathers were slaveholders. What about men like John Adams and Benjamin Rush, who helped birth the Constitution? They were opposed to slavery.  Isn\u2019t what you said unfair to them? No, because even for the founders who weren\u2019t slaveholders, they willing to make deals with slaveholders. One of the ways that we know that the John Adamses of the world knew that slavery was wrong is that they refused to put the word \u201cslavery\u201d in their precious document.  The word \u201cslavery\u201d is referred to only obliquely in the original Constitution. The first and only time the word \u201cslavery\u201d appears in the Constitution is in the 13th Amendment outlawing it. What do I take from that? These White people knew that what they were doing (by accepting the existence of slavery in the original draft of the Constitution) was wrong. And they did not stop it. Instead, they made deals with the Southern slaveholders in order to have a frigging country. But what about the pragmatic side to that decision? The only way the US could have a nation and a Constitution was to make that deal. How is it pragmatic to say that the only way we can have something that we really want is to hold an entire people in bondage for hundreds of years.?  How is that a deal? They didn\u2019t ask my people. They didn\u2019t ask women if they wanted to be part of the deal. I understand from the perspective of a rich White person, it was a fair deal. If you are sick of being taxed by a government from across the sea, it makes sense. I find that argument to be intellectually and morally weak. So don\u2019t make the deal. Don\u2019t break bread with slavers and slaveholders for economic opportunities. I don\u2019t think that that is how things had to happen. There were people in real time who were saying slavery is wrong and should never be allowed. I saw a recent interview where you called Chief Justice John Roberts the \u201cchief architect on the assault on democracy\u201d in this country. That sounds harsh for a public figure that\u2019s pretty popular. You may have heard about the recent Gallup Poll, where he had the highest approval rating of any federal leader. John Roberts has been the enemy of voter equality for his entire professional career. In 1982, Congress amended the Voting Rights Act because while it was illegal to discriminate against people based on the color of their skin, in 1981 you had to prove that the state legislature intended to discriminate. In 1982, they updated the law to mean that you didn\u2019t have to show intent. If your voter law had a discriminatory impact, the fact that it was discriminatory was enough. [What Mystal is describing has long been a battleground in voting rights: Can a law violate the Voting Rights Act even if legislators never announce their \u201cintent\u201d by mentioning race?] [President Ronald] Reagan said that the Voting Rights Act humiliated the South. Reagan brought in a guy to figure out how to oppose the 1982 Voting Rights Act amendment, and that guy is John Roberts. John Roberts got his legal start arguing against the Voting Rights Act. John Roberts has been the enemy of black people voting for his entire career. He showed it in the 2013 [Shelby v. Holder ruling] when he eviscerated Section Five of the Voting Rights Act. That\u2019s the preclearance provision that Reagan thought was humiliating to the South. He has been the architect of this assault on democracy. Why is Roberts\u2019 Shelby decision so offensive to you? In your book, you talked about Roberts\u2019 deciding in his majority opinion that racism was over and that Section Five was no longer needed. [Author\u2019s note: Roberts never claimed racism was over but wrote in the decision that \u201cour country has changed\u201d and that Congress must pass voting rights legislation that \u201cspeaks to current conditions.\u201d] It\u2019s ridiculous to me that John Roberts, a White elite person, would be the guy to know when racism in the Deep South has subsided to the point where Black people do not need protections of their equal rights. He would be the last guy to know that in terms of his own experience and quite frankly in terms of how the Supreme Court is supposed to function. The Supreme Court would be the last institution to know that. Congress is supposed to be the institution to know that. And Congress said we still need the Voting Rights Act. It was reaffirmed in 2006 by a voice vote in the House, which means it was so popular that they didn\u2019t bother to do a roll call, and in the Senate. Congress says that we needed the Voting Rights Act, but the Supreme Court stepped in and said, \u2018actually, no, we don\u2019t,\u2019 because racism has been defeated in the South. You talk in your book about how the Supreme Court in the late 19th century made a string of racist decisions that made the rise of Jim Crow possible. Do you think one day historians will look at rulings from the Roberts Court, such as the Shelby decision, and place them in the same league? History is written by the victors, and right now his side is winning.  But assuming that his side eventually loses, I think Roberts\u2019 popularity will fade as we get further from his decisions. The negative and racially biased impact of the decisions will become more apparent. People will look at things like Shelby County and come to the determination that Roberts was an enemy of racial progress in this country. He is a friend and a handmaiden to White supremacy. People look at his persona and they\u2019re saying he can\u2019t possibly be that bad. It\u2019s because very few people have actually read his decisions and actually understand his entire history on these issues.",

            "article_content": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is facing fierce criticism for comments he made this week in response to a question about the concerns of voters of color. Virginia Democratic Rep. Donald McEachin condemned the remark in a letter to the Kentucky Republican, saying, \u201cI am writing today in response to your recent comment on voting rights in which you insinuated that African Americans are somehow not American citizens.\u201d \u201cThis is 2022 and being American is not synonymous with looking or thinking like you. African Americans are, in fact, American citizens deserving of our recognition, respect, and equal protections under the law.\u201d At the Republican leadership\u2019s weekly news conference held on Wednesday, Latino Rebels reporter Pablo Manr\u00edquez asked McConnell what his message was to voters of color who are concerned they would not be able to vote in the midterms if Congress failed to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. \u201cWell, the concern is misplaced because if you look at the statistics, African American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as Americans,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cA recent survey, 94% of Americans thought it was easy to vote. This is not a problem. Turn out is up.\u201d Asked by CNN whether the senator had left out a word in his comment, a spokesman for his office said McConnell meant to say \u201cother Americans\u201d not just \u201cAmericans.\u201d The apparent misstatement has led to heavy criticism from the left, with groups using the Twitter hashtag #Mitchplease to address the Republican leader. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely giving #MitchPlease. African Americans are ARE Americans, 365 days a year!\u201d read a tweet posted by the Congressional Black Caucus account. McConnell, in a statement provided to CNN on Thursday by his team, said he has \u201cconsistently pointed to the record-high turnout for all voters in the 2020 election, including African-Americans.\u201d This is not the first time McConnell has come under fire for comments pertaining to issues of race and racial discrimination in America. In 2019, when asked about his position on reparations for slavery in advance of a historic House hearing on the matter, he said in part, \u201cWe\u2019ve elected an African American president.\u201d The response sparked outrage, with some arguing he had suggested the country paid for \u201cthe sin of slavery\u201d by electing Barack Obama. And last year when asked about the racial history of the filibuster, McConnell responded, \u201cIt has no racial history at all. None.\u201d \u201cFor more than a century the filibuster was widely understood to be primarily dedicated to maintaining White supremacy and blocking civil rights,\u201d Adam Jentleson, author of \u201cKill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of Democracy,\u201d said at the time. A spokesperson for McConnell later clarified that the senator \u201cwas referring to the origins of the filibuster.\u201d This story has been updated with a statement from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.",

            "article_content": "Election officials in a rural Georgia county are weighing plans to close all but one polling place ahead of this year\u2019s elections, alarming local voting and civil rights groups. But the deliberations by the Lincoln County elections board have reverberated far beyond this Georgia community of roughly 7,700 northwest of Augusta. The county is one of six in this battleground state that have disbanded or reconfigured their local election boards in the last year, thanks to recently passed bills by the Republican-controlled Georgia General Assembly. Several Democrats have been tossed off the boards. One reconstituted board eliminated Sunday voting during a recent municipal election \u2013 an option popular among Black churchgoers, a key Democratic constituency. Say goodbye to making Election Day a federal holiday and other pro-voting ideas \u201cWhat\u2019s happening in Georgia with the dismantling of these county election boards is an extreme example of the national trend in Republican-controlled states to undermine local election officials,\u201d said Jonathan Diaz, senior legal counsel for voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, which advocates for broad access to the ballot. Republican-controlled legislators in Georgia, Texas, Arizona and Florida all have enacted new restrictions on voting in the year since President Joe Biden assumed office. Voting rights activists say this is a pattern of Republicans expanding their influence over election administration in these politically competitive states in advance of this year\u2019s critical midterm elections. And it\u2019s not likely to stop there. New legislative proposals that target election operations have cropped up in Georgia, a state with high-stakes contests this year for governor and a US Senate seat. While battles over poll closures often garner little attention, Diaz said, \u201cthe procedures that happen behind the scenes can really affect whether your vote matters.\u201d In Lincoln County \u2013 a GOP stronghold where Donald Trump received more than 68% of the vote in 2020 and where 29% of its residents are Black \u2013 the all-Republican county commission now appoints three out of five election board members. Officials there say closing six of seven polling places will eliminate the need to send equipment and staff around the county. It also will help mothball cramped and outdated polling sites that don\u2019t allow for social distancing, county leaders say. All voting would happen at a central location in Lincolnton, the county seat, under the consolidation plan the elections board is set to consider. But in a community with little reliable public transportation, \u201cthe poor and marginalized people won\u2019t be able to vote because, bottom line, they won\u2019t be able to get to the polls,\u201d said the Rev. Christopher Johnson, the head of the Greater Augusta\u2019s Interfaith Coalition \u2013 one of the groups fighting the change. \u201cWe should be making voting more accessible,\u201d said the Rev. Denise Freeman, a Lincoln County activist. \u201cIt looks like they only want a select group of people to be able to vote.\u201d Freeman \u2013 who has gone door to door encouraging voters to sign petitions to stop the closures \u2013 said some voters would have to travel more than 20 miles to cast their ballots if the consolidation plans proceed. (The elections board delayed a planned vote on the matter Wednesday night to review petitions submitted by the consolidation opponents.) Lincoln County Commission Chairman Walker Norman, a Republican, defended both the changes to the election board and the poll closures, saying it will help move voters and election equipment to a central, modern facility. The future of the GOP is at stake in this Georgia battle \u201cThis has nothing to do with suppressing anybody\u2019s vote,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have some little, old concrete block voting precincts that have been used for 40 years with no handicapped facilities at all,\u201d Norman told CNN in a recent phone interview. \u201cNo real heat at all, no air-conditioning.\u201d And he scoffed at the idea that people would have problems casting their ballots, saying \u201c99.9 percent of the public today has automobiles\u201d and can get to the central polling location. Voters also can seek absentee ballots to vote by mail, he said. The county\u2019s election director, Lilvender Bolton, told CNN this week that officials are prepared to arrange rides to the polling place for voters without transportation. Georgia state Sen. Lee Anderson, the Republican who authored the bills abolishing and reconstituting the Lincoln County elections board, did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Moves in Georgia to close polling places \u2013 or make other changes to electoral procedures \u2013 once required advance federal approval under the 1965 Voting Rights Act to ensure they didn\u2019t hurt Black and minority voters. A Supreme Court ruling in 2013 struck down the heart of that law, however, freeing Georgia and eight other states \u2013 along with a slew of counties and cities in other parts of the country with a history of racial discrimination \u2013 from that federal scrutiny. But Democratic efforts to pass an updated version of the Voting Rights Act have faltered in the US Senate. Republicans have blocked consideration of any federal voting laws. And the continued reluctance of two Democrats, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, to change Senate rules to allow a straight party-line vote on the measure likely has doomed its chances. The actions to disband smaller county boards come as the election operations in the state\u2019s most populous county face scrutiny. Fulton County, a Democratic stronghold that includes much of Atlanta, is the target of an investigation of its practices ordered by the state elections board. And if Fulton officials flunk the review, the GOP-controlled state board could move to replace the county\u2019s election leadership, under the provisions of a sweeping election bill Georgia Republicans enacted last year. Helen Butler, who oversees the Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, is a Democrat who was removed from the elections board in Morgan County in one of the county shakeups last year. She worries the new Georgia laws could set the stage for election subversion. Embattled election chief in Fulton County resigns \u201cIf you have one party that controls who gets appointed to the boards of election, who gets to certify results and whose votes get counted, then if there is someone with an ideology that says \u2018We don\u2019t like the outcome\u2019 (of an election), they have a better opportunity to do something about it,\u201d she said. The moves are happening as Georgia has become one of the most important states on the political map this year. Record turnout in the Peach State in the 2020 election helped propel President Joe Biden into the White House and gave his party control of the US Senate after Georgians elected two Democrats, Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Warnock, chosen by voters in a special election, is on the ballot again this year in a high-profile race that could pit him against Trump\u2019s choice for the Republican nomination, the former football star Herschel Walker. Two other Trump-endorsed candidates are competing in primaries to try to oust Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. Trump has blamed Kemp and Rafffensperger for his nearly 12,000-vote loss in the state. Raffensperger famously rebuffed Trump\u2019s entreaty to \u201cfind\u201d the votes to overturn Biden\u2019s victory. Meanwhile, Democrat Stacey Abrams, who lost to Kemp in 2018, is making another run for governor. A sweeping elections bill enacted last year in Georgia removed Raffensperger as a voting member of the state elections board. Another proposal from Republicans this year could further sideline election officials by allowing the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to open probes into election-related complaints. For his part, Raffensperger is pushing a constitutional amendment to prevent noncitizens from voting in state elections \u2013 although they already are barred from doing so under existing state law. Another prominent Republican in the state, Senate President Pro Tempore Butch Miller, who is running for lieutenant governor, has proposed banning the use of ballot drop boxes. Georgia GOP lawmakers last year limited the number and locations of ballot drop boxes, after they were widely used in the 2020 election to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. As a result, election officials can offer one ballot drop box per 100,000 registered voters. (A recent analysis by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found that their use has plummeted \u2013 with about half as many absentee voters returning their ballots in drop boxes in the Atlanta area last year compared with the 2020 general election.) Miller has said the boxes are viewed as a \u201cweak link\u201d in protecting elections from fraud and eliminating their use will \u201chelp rebuild the trust that has been lost.\u201d All the individual changes to election procedures in states like Georgia could add up to big obstacles to voting this year, said Sean Morales-Doyle, acting director of the voting rights and elections program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University\u2019s law school. \u201cIn a lot of places where we are seeing restrictions, we are seeing restrictions on top of restrictions,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you keep putting burdens on top of burdens, you are going to make it harder to vote.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

            "article_content": "Democrats appear certain to add another failure to their list of missed deadlines and thwarted legacy goals this week, with a push for voting rights bills expected to crash in the Senate with humiliating implications for Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The party faces a moment of stark symbolism just a day after the holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., which Democrats had set as a deadline to pass new laws to counter Republican curtailments on voting in multiple states. Votes expected to be called by Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will enshrine ideological divides in the party and call into question the credibility of an under-pressure President who has led a full-throated campaign for legislation demanded by modern civil rights leaders in the week that he marks his anniversary in office. An Arizona Trump rally and voting rights march underscore the fight for democracy Despite several early term successes, the voting rights standoff, and a separate but similar one over Biden\u2019s social welfare and climate plan, emphasize the near-impossibility of enacting major reform with a 50-50 Senate majority. All it takes is one senator to stall an entire agenda. A failed voting rights drive will also deal a blow to Black leaders who were instrumental to Biden\u2019s win in the Democratic primary and the election in 2020. Many of those campaigners believe that the White House waited too long to make voting rights the main focus on his presidency \u2013 notwithstanding the fact that Biden had no credible path to passing the bills into law. Without the legislation, there could be serious consequences for Democratic enthusiasm and turnout in vital swing states in November\u2019s midterm elections. In a broader sense, the roadblock that Biden has hit in the Senate reveals the reality of a President who is in power but is unable to wield the full weight of his office because of tiny congressional majorities delivered by voters in 2020. The situation is exacerbated by almost blanket Republican opposition \u2013 save for a bipartisan infrastructure deal last year that evaded ex-Presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama but that Biden delivered in one of his major achievements. This week\u2019s theater will create a fresh picture of the futility of Democratic power in Washington. Yet the obstacle to passing voting rights reform and the Build Back Better climate and spending bill were obvious long ago. But the White House and Democratic leaders chose to press ahead anyway with no clear path to success. Absent some last minute reversal by Manchin and Sinema, which is highly unlikely, the current snarl raises questions about the White House\u2019s political strategy and decision to prepare the public for historic generational reforms without the guarantee that they could be enacted. At this point, there is a strong sense that Senate votes are being held for mostly political reasons rather than in any expectations they will deliver new laws. When they hit the Senate wall, it\u2019s not clear what Democrats will do next. Asked on Monday about the administration\u2019s plans, Harris said the strategy was to \u201ckeep working on it.\u201d What to know about the Senate's nuclear option \u201cI\u2019m making calls and meeting with folks. We\u2019re not going to give up. You\u2019ve heard me say that before, and I mean it. This is too important,\u201d the vice president told reporters. It\u2019s true that the story of the civil rights struggle was played out over decades, encountered worse congressional obstruction than is likely to unfold this week and ultimately rewarded dedicated political campaigning. But if Democrats cannot pass their voting rights bills soon, they may lose the opportunity to do so for years with Republicans confident of capturing control of the House of Representatives and eyeing a Senate takeover in November\u2019s elections. Manchin and Sinema have been impervious to pressure, and appear only to have become more entrenched the more intense the scrutiny of their positions. They have both argued \u2013 without much recent evidence \u2013 that the filibuster promotes bipartisan cooperation and laws that can be accepted by a majority of Americans. In a Senate speech last week that effectively served as a rebuke to Biden, Sinema also warned that eliminating the 60-vote threshold would in itself wipe out a safeguard for democracy and empower future demagogues. At the same time, Biden has effectively weakened his own political authority by signing up to deadlines and timelines \u2013 from the passage of the voting rights legislation to the declaration of partial independence from the coronavirus pandemic last year \u2013 that have been missed. At least four trips up to Capitol Hill to cajole Democrats, including on the spending and climate bill, yielded little result for a President who sold his long record as a senator during the 2020 campaign as proof he could build governing coalitions. And the President effectively put the entire credibility of his administration on the line last week with a major civil rights and voting rights speech in Atlanta that even some in his own party suggested went too far in comparing lawmakers who do not support changing filibuster rules to segregationists. 'History will be watching what happens tomorrow': King family demands Senate pass voting rights legislation Now Biden and the Democrats have raised the stakes for themselves by declaring a fateful moment for democracy but are at risk of coming away with nothing in a failure that could further dampen public perceptions of Biden\u2019s term, which is struggling to regain momentum in a midterm election year. If the voting rights legislation fails this week, as is expected, it is not clear how Democrats will proceed. While one single Republican, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, has expressed support for one of the current bills, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, all of the GOP Senate conference opposes the Freedom to Vote Act. Taken together, the measures would allow all Americans the right to a mail-in vote, create Election Day as a national holiday, standardize voting rules and restore protections against racial discrimination in state voting laws stripped by the Supreme Court. Republicans brand the bills as a federal takeover of the election system and rebuff criticism of state voting laws, which are rooted in Trump\u2019s lies the 2020 election was stolen. Some Republicans have expressed interest in working to amend the Electoral Count Act to eliminate shenanigans like Trump\u2019s coup plot to subvert the certification of the 2020 election that led to the Capitol insurrection. This would be a tangible step. But it would not placate voting rights activists who argue that the Republican flurry of state laws designed to suppress the vote and politicize election certification has put American democracy itself at risk. Martin Luther King III, son of the assassinated civil rights pioneer, tapped into that sense of urgency on Monday, warning that students in 50 years would read about what happens in the Senate this week. \u201cNo matter what happens tomorrow, we must keep the pressure on and say no more empty words. Don\u2019t tell us what you believe in, show us with your votes,\u201d he said. \u201cHistory will be watching what happens tomorrow.\u201d Pro-Trump Republicans try to rewrite state election laws as a voting rights showdown looms in Congress Democracy advocates are especially concerned at measures in some states that seek to politicize the non-partisan process of collecting and tabulating election results, after some notable Republican officials stood firm in 2020 against Trump\u2019s bid to steal an election that multiple courts and even his own Justice Department said he lost. The threat on this score posed by the increasingly autocratic Trump is only becoming more extreme. The ex-President spewed more delusional and dangerous lies about non-existent election fraud at a rally in Arizona on Saturday night. He also pressured legislators in the state to decertify Biden\u2019s victory in the election. In a recent video message, the twice-impeached, defeated ex-President also claimed he won Pennsylvania, a state he in fact lost by more than 80,000 votes to Biden. \u201cWe have to be a lot sharper the next time when it comes to counting the votes,\u201d said Trump, who has been trying to leverage supporters onto election boards and into positions responsible for running voting across the country. \u201cSometimes the vote counter is more important than the candidate,\u201d he added. So far, Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert the 2020 election have all failed. But his tantrum after refusing to admit defeat to Biden has resulted in substantial changes to the US electoral system that arguably make it less democratic. The current President and his party may be about to squander their best, and perhaps last chance to respond.",

            "article_content": "Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs \u2013 best known nationally for taking a stand against former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of election fraud \u2013 entered this year\u2019s governor\u2019s race as the prohibitive favorite among Democrats. But her involvement in an employee termination seven years ago threatens to weaken her candidacy in a purple state Democrats are hoping to turn more blue in November. At issue is the 2015 termination of the only Black policy staffer working in the state Senate when Hobbs was Democratic leader in the chamber. Hobbs\u2019 role \u2013 and the way she\u2019s spoken about it recently \u2013 has divided leaders in the state\u2019s Black community, jeopardizing her support among a key constituency as she heads into a bruising election year in a state President Joe Biden won by fewer than 11,000 votes. Five Black leaders who spoke to CNN said the case has struck a nerve in Arizona, not only because of their historical marginalization in the workplace, but also because of the state\u2019s history of discrimination against voters of color, which was compounded by the efforts of Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. Hobbs offered an extensive apology in early December \u2013 stating that she now recognizes that her \u201cexperience and understanding of racism has sometimes been too narrow.\u201d And her allies insist that those who have spoken out against her were unlikely to back her candidacy anyway. But it remains to be seen how voters will respond as her Democratic rivals raise it as a campaign issue ahead of the August primary. The controversy arose shortly after Hobbs was elected Democratic leader in the Arizona state Senate in late 2014. Attorney Talonya Adams, a Senate policy adviser, alleged that she was paid less than White men who were serving in similar roles in the legislature and said she was fired after asking supervisors, including Hobbs, about staff salaries. In two federal jury trials alleging discrimination based on race and sex by the Arizona Senate, Adams represented herself and won. A federal jury first awarded her $1 million in 2019. But the judge ordered a new trial in response to arguments from the state that Adams had failed to present sufficient evidence for the jury\u2019s finding that the state Senate retaliated against her for complaining that her lower pay resulted from discrimination. That second trial concluded in November, with a federal jury awarding Adams $2.75 million. It found she \u201ccomplained that she was being discriminated against on the basis of race or sex with respect to her pay and was terminated for that reason.\u201d The judge reduced the damages to $300,000 \u2013 along with back pay Adams was owed \u2013 due to limits on compensatory damages. The Arizona Senate has not indicated whether it will appeal the second verdict, and Adams told CNN she is taking steps to sue Hobbs personally, alleging that the Democratic secretary of state has damaged her reputation by suggesting outside of court that Adams was fired because of unspecified performance issues, rather than race and gender. Hobbs told the Arizona Mirror in November, \u201cI can say with certainty on my part, my decision in the termination was not based on race or gender. There were other factors.\u201d Through a campaign spokeswoman, Hobbs declined to speak to CNN for this story and did not respond to a series of written questions about the case and her handling of the termination. Attorneys representing the Arizona Senate did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests to discuss their arguments in the case. But Hobbs testified that Adams was insubordinate by repeatedly raising questions about employment issues in 2015 \u2013 including with multiple Democratic lawmakers after she was told they should be directed to the Democratic chief of staff. Hobbs said Adams showed a similar pattern of refusing to drop what Hobbs viewed as a settled issue with Adams\u2019 2014 request for time off related to academic field work for her MBA program. Hobbs also testified in 2021 that she was new in the Senate minority leader role during the 2015 episode with Adams and that she came to learn that \u201cthe system doesn\u2019t work right\u201d and was sorry that she hadn\u2019t done more to address \u201cpay equity.\u201d Because Republicans were in the majority, she testified, \u201cthe Democratic staff, who happened to be more reflective of Arizona in terms of diversity, got paid less because those decisions were made by the majority.\u201d But the case has become a central point of contention in the Democratic gubernatorial primary that appears unlikely to recede from the headlines \u2013 both because of Hobbs\u2019 response to the November verdict and the controversy over her decision to terminate Adams in 2015, which she made in consultation with then-Democratic chief of staff Jeff Winkler and then-Senate Republican chief of staff Wendy Baldo. It has created disquiet about her judgment and the vulnerability of her candidacy within her party, according to a half-dozen Arizona Democratic strategists, lawmakers and activists who spoke to CNN on background to discuss the dynamics of the race. Hobbs\u2019 equivocation about the case after the November verdict \u2013 including two different statements released weeks apart \u2013 drew criticism from many corners, including from both her Democratic and Republican opponents. She at first did not take responsibility for the discrimination against Adams \u2013 with her campaign blaming the Republican Senate leadership. In that first statement, Hobbs\u2019 spokesperson told the Arizona Republic, \u201cthe Republican majority chief of staff acted as her supervisor and the ultimate decision-maker regarding the termination of her employment.\u201d But that assertion conflicts with Baldo\u2019s testimony in the 2021 trial about the basis for the decision when she told Adams under direct questioning that the \u201cdecision was made by Minority Leader Katie Hobbs and Jeff Winkler to terminate you. And they asked me in my role as chief of staff to contact you.\u201d Winkler and Baldo did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Six prominent Black Arizona leaders released a statement in November calling on voters to \u201creconsider\u201d their support for Hobbs as governor, because of what they view as her \u201cunjust actions\u201d toward Adams, her initial refusal to admit that discrimination occurred, and her failure to \u201ctake responsibility for her role in the retaliatory termination.\u201d Hobbs\u2019 two Democratic rivals \u2013 former state Rep. Aaron Lieberman and former Nogales Mayor Marco Lopez \u2013 have expressed concerns that voters of color might stay home if Hobbs is the party\u2019s nominee. The eventual nominee could face Trump-backed candidate Kari Lake, who has repeated the former President\u2019s election lies, in November. GOP Gov. Doug Ducey is term-limited and not running. \u201cIf we alienate diverse communities, they won\u2019t show up for us as Democrats, and we\u2019re going to lose. That\u2019s, that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Lopez, a former Obama administration official, told CNN. \u201cTo have someone (in Hobbs\u2019 position) who is trying to lead the ticket and trying to lead a state that has a history of demonizing people of color is really troublesome as a party.\u201d Lieberman argued that Hobbs\u2019 role in firing an employee who repeatedly complained about her pay violated core Democratic values. \u201cWe want to uplift people; we want equal pay for equal work, and we want to fight against discrimination, not take part in it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jury has spoken now twice, that Katie was part of this really unfortunate incident.\u201d Normally Republicans \u201chave to be creative and figure out how they are going to attack our candidates,\u201d Lieberman added. \u201cThese negative ads have already been written \u2013 it\u2019s just Talonya Adams speaking to camera directly and saying Katie Hobbs is unfit to be governor,\u201d he added, explaining how he expects Adams\u2019 public comments in recent press conferences to be used against the party\u2019s would-be nominee in a general election. With the advantage of more than six months to go before the primary, Hobbs has been working to make amends. In a December Twitter video, she said she understood that her first response to the November verdict was \u201cunnecessarily defensive\u201d and \u201cfell short of taking real accountability,\u201d adding that she was \u201ctruly sorry for the real harm that I caused Ms. Adams and her family.\u201d \u201cWhat Ms. Adams experienced is yet another example of the systemic inequities and racism that have long permeated every aspect of our lives, too often in ways that are invisible to people like me,\u201d Hobbs, who is White, said in the video. She added that she has \u201cmissed personal and leadership opportunities to fight harder for racial equity.\u201d She promised she would work not only to be \u201can ally,\u201d but also an \u201cadvocate\u201d going forward, and vowed to recruit and \u201celevate\u201d women and people of color to leadership positions on her campaign. Those who are championing Hobbs\u2019 candidacy insist that she has yet to lose significant support for her campaign. They point to Black leaders like Garrick McFadden, the former vice chair of the Arizona Democratic Party, who was critical of Hobbs after the 2019 verdict, but now argues that she understands her mistakes and has taken real accountability for her actions. McFadden pointed to what he sees as Hobbs\u2019 more recent work to right injustices, including her advocacy for removing Confederate monuments from the state Capitol grounds, as well as her efforts as secretary of state to correct pay inequities after The Arizona Republic published a database of public employee salaries statewide in 2019. Her campaign aides say that as secretary of state she has focused specifically on giving raises to women of color, some of whom were making less than $15 per hour, and on increasing diversity, with employees of color now comprising nearly 43% of the office\u2019s staff compared to 33% when she arrived, according to figures compiled by the office. Her senior leadership team at the secretary of state\u2019s office is primarily composed of women, according to her campaign. Hobbs\u2019 allies say she has also been laser-focused on preventing the disenfranchisement of voters of color in her current role, which McFadden said has opened her eyes to the more subtle forms of racism that exist in Arizona. \u201cDoing her job in a state that was protected under the Voting Rights Act, she knows about the disenfranchisement of Black voters, of voters of color \u2013 especially in Arizona (among) Latinos and indigenous people. To do her job, she had to evolve,\u201d McFadden said. But Karl Gentles, co-chair of the Black Engagement Committee of the Maricopa County Democratic Party, said the rollout of Hobbs\u2019 apology about the jury verdict \u201cwas not the most effective, nor successful\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201cstill a lot of work to be done to regain the trust and confidence of voters.\u201d \u201cThere are some in the African American community who are willing to give (Hobbs) a chance, but obviously there are others who have taken a real wait-and-see position in terms of looking for actions, instead of words,\u201d he said. Not only did Adams represent herself and win in federal court twice, Gentles said, \u201cbut she showed others that they could stand up for themselves, fight for themselves, and have a voice and not accept the status quo.\u201d \u201cShe has exposed some systemic issues that we as African Americans have known and experienced for many, many years \u2013 and have never had the real voice or opportunity to bring to light,\u201d he said. Warren Stewart Jr., a pastor and activist, said the controversy is forcing a reckoning about racism within the ranks of the Arizona Democratic Party \u2013 and he called on the state party to ask Hobbs to step aside in the governor\u2019s race. CNN has reached out to the state party. Stewart, who also co-chairs the county party\u2019s Black Engagement Committee but spoke to CNN in his personal capacity, said he was troubled by Hobbs\u2019 responses to questions about the case from the committee in a vetting session that they did with her after the November verdict. \u201cHer response was very well scripted, but it was not taking responsibility; it was not apologetic,\u201d he said. Stewart called her subsequent December apology \u201ctoo late.\u201d The Adams case has shown, Stewart said, that \u201cwe really have to vet our politicians and elected officials to see if Black lives do matter, and if the rights of all people \u2013 groups that are oppressed and marginalized \u2013 matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m at a place where I am not impressed by apologies and videos,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cI think the most noble thing that Katie could do is to step down and wait until she has proven herself as a leader.\u201d Some of Hobbs\u2019 critics, including Stewart, have also cited the 2013 ouster of the first Black minority leader in the Arizona Senate as a reason for concern. Hobbs joined the majority of the Democratic caucus in voting to remove former Senate Minority Leader Leah Landrum Taylor from her leadership position, which angered some other Democratic members. Hobbs testified that the ouster was the result of an internal caucus dispute, but Taylor testified that the move was \u201cunprecedented\u201d and that she \u201cdid not have any idea why\u201d she was ousted from her post. Taylor declined CNN\u2019s request for comment. The conflict between Adams and Hobbs at the Arizona Senate arose in February of 2015, more than two years after Adams joined the staff as a policy adviser and shortly after Hobbs ascended to the position of minority leader. Adams, who was making $60,000 a year, told CNN that she had long suspected that she was being paid less than her male colleagues. She testified that she met with Hobbs and Winkler, the Democratic chief of staff, in February 2015 to raise concerns about her workload and her salary. She told CNN that she argued in the initial meetings that her workload staffing legislative committees was heavier and more challenging than that of several of her male counterparts. But Winkler testified that while Adams handled three committees and several other policy staffers only staffed two, they had other duties as part of their job descriptions (like serving as communications director, for example). Adams testified during the 2019 trial that she raised her concerns about discrimination with several lawmakers, as well as Baldo, the Republican chief of staff. Adams said she told Baldo that she believed women were \u201cunderwriting the work of these men and that I feel strongly that I\u2019m being treated differently,\u201d according to court transcripts. Hobbs and Winkler rebuffed her requests to discuss her salary, Adams told CNN, telling her they could not engage in those kinds of discussions until after the legislative session because of an agreement with Republicans. Hobbs testified in November that she became concerned by Adams\u2019 \u201cseries of requests\u201d wanting to discuss employment issues. The issue came to a head when the Arizona Capitol Times published a list of Senate salaries and Adams discovered not only that several of her White male counterparts were receiving higher salaries, but that several had also received raises. She reached out about the protocol for requesting a raise to the Republican chief of staff, who, Adams said, told her to email her Democratic leadership team. Adams did that, asking them to discuss her status on the team \u2013 to which Hobbs responded that her request was inappropriate, referring her back to the Democratic chief of staff. Hobbs testified in the first trial that she was \u201cdisturbed\u201d by Adams\u2019 conduct \u2013 reaching out to the entire leadership team about her salary concerns after she had already been rebuffed \u2013 and viewed the email as manipulative. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the timeline or how many times this happened, but when we didn\u2019t give Ms. Adams the answer that she wanted, she went to \u2013 directly to\u2026 Wendy (Baldo) or the Senate president, even after being redirected (to Winkler) multiple times,\u201d Hobbs said, according to court transcripts from the second trial. Hobbs said in 2019 testimony that the Senate Democratic Caucus aides \u201cwere the lowest paid staff of all the legislative staff\u201d and she and her colleagues were \u201ctrying to fight for increased pay\u201d at that time. Salaries had long been a subject of contention within the Arizona legislature, Winkler noted during the first trial, because there is no agreement between the House and Senate about what the appropriate salary level is for similar jobs. Several aides who worked in the Arizona legislature at the same time as Adams, who asked to remain anonymous in interviews with CNN because of fear of retribution, echoed Hobbs\u2019 argument in her testimony that the pay disparities for staffers stemmed not from issues of race and gender, but rather from the fact that Republicans held majority control, limiting the purse strings of Democrats. They said they believed Hobbs has been unfairly portrayed during coverage of the trial, arguing that she has long been committed to equity and advancing opportunities for both women and aides of color. Aside from the salary discussions, Hobbs cited one previous instance to justify her view that Adams showed a pattern of refusing to drop what Hobbs considered to be a settled issue, arguing that she felt Adams was \u201cuntruthful\u201d about her request for time off for the trip that was required as part of her MBA coursework. Hobbs said she had discovered Adams wasn\u2019t allowed to take time off under a previous agreement with the Senate allowing her to pursue the degree, but Adams told CNN the agreement was \u201csubject to revision.\u201d Hobbs testified that she never documented any concerns about Adams or pursued any disciplinary action against her. Asked about Adams\u2019 skills and performance during the earlier trial, Hobbs testified that she believed Adams was \u201cvery competent\u201d in her role as a policy adviser during the two years they had worked together. Winkler testified in 2019, however, that Adams was \u201cout of the office a lot, and I think that was noted by most members of the staff.\u201d Adams denied that there were ever any issues with her performance when asked about the criticisms by CNN. Adams\u2019 notification of her termination eventually came when she was out of town caring for her son. On the same Friday that she reached out about the salary discrepancies published in the Capitol Times, she emailed Winkler and copied Hobbs to notify them that her son was having emergency medical issues, that it was \u201ctouch and go,\u201d and that she would likely need to travel to Seattle. Winkler responded in an email that was shown in court that \u201cfamily comes first\u201d and that she should do what she needed to do for her son. But Winkler testified that he did not perceive his response as approval for Adams to leave immediately for Seattle \u2013 which she did that weekend \u2013 and that he believed Adams was still going to meet at his office on Monday to discuss her pay concerns and an inquiry she had made about the family and medical leave policy. When Adams did not appear at work that Monday, Winkler engaged in a series of meetings with Hobbs and Baldo about her. He testified that she had given \u201cno notice that she was actually leaving\u201d and \u201cno handoff\u201d to the team. (During the trial, Adams presented phone records showing she had contacted both the main line at the office, and Winkler directly, four times on that first Monday that she was gone, starting early that morning). Though Hobbs was copied on Adams\u2019 Friday night email explaining her son\u2019s emergency medical needs, Hobbs testified that she also did not think Winkler\u2019s response amounted to approval of emergency leave and testified that she did not know why Adams had left. \u201cIt is not my understanding at all that any of us knew that there was an emergency that needed to be attended to,\u201d Hobbs said, according to court transcripts. Winkler testified that the \u201cconversation about termination ensued\u201d after he asked Hobbs whether she trusted Adams, and the then-minority leader responded that she did not. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem if the leader of the caucus doesn\u2019t trust an individual member of the staff,\u201d he said, calling the termination a \u201cconsensus decision.\u201d Adams was terminated for \u201cabandonment of position\u201d and \u201cinsubordinate behavior,\u201d according to Winkler\u2019s November testimony. Hobbs had testified in 2019 that it\u2019s \u201cnever an easy decision to terminate someone\u2019s employment,\u201d but \u201cI think we all agreed that we had lost trust and confidence in Ms. Adams and that was why that decision was made.\u201d Adams told CNN she was stunned that Hobbs made so little effort to understand or address the pay and workload issues that she raised \u2013 and showed \u201cno care and no concern\u201d as to why she was absent from work at the time that she was terminated. \u201cYou are going to take away someone\u2019s livelihood from them for reasons seven years later that you can\u2019t even remember or articulate, and had no direct knowledge of at all?\u201d Adams told CNN, calling that a \u201cblatant disregard\u201d for an employee\u2019s welfare. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m the only African American staffer in either chamber, right? And nothing in her mind says: \u2018Can we just see what\u2019s going on here?\u2019\u201d In addition to apologizing to Adams in a 2019 statement, Hobbs testified that she left Adams a voicemail and told her she wished she\u2019d been a \u201cbetter ally.\u201d Adams said she still has never spoken to Hobbs directly beyond their interactions in court since she was fired, and that she believes Hobbs\u2019 public apology in December was driven by political pressure. \u201cShe has always, up until the second week of November of 2021, been adamant, been righteously indignant \u2013 it has been a point of pride \u2013 that she has been justified,\u201d Adams said. \u201cShe has articulated proudly and loudly in many different venues her decision to terminate my employment, so to see this about-face eleven-and-a-half months out from a gubernatorial election, it\u2019s shocking. It really is shocking.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats control Washington but President Joe Biden is staring at a wall of conservative power, accrued over years and wielded with a ruthlessness and zeal for rule-breaking that his own party has rarely matched. The President\u2019s struggles to implement his strategy to protect US democracy and reshape the economy to help working Americans are hampered by divisions in his own party. But a wider battle is playing out \u2013 a generational struggle between conservatism and liberal activism that Biden appears to be losing, despite some early legislative successes, as the right\u2019s hold on critical institutions of the US political system tightens. On Thursday, the new conservative Supreme Court majority, fresh from weakening the constitutional right to an abortion, dealt another devastating blow to Biden, striking down his Covid-19 vaccine and testing requirement mandates for big businesses. The decision completed a desperate day for the President after two Democratic senators rebuked his call to change Senate rules in order to pass voting rights legislation. The pair, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, were at the White House for last-ditch talks with Biden on Thursday night. Majority Leader Chuck Schumer later announced the Senate would take up the voting rights legislation on Tuesday, citing Covid-19 and an impending winter storm, which means the chamber will miss his self-imposed deadline of voting by the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday on Monday. Day of defeats threatens Biden's attempt at second year reset But unless those two moderates change their minds, Democrats will lose a chance to halt the other big current conservative power play \u2013 a nationwide effort by GOP-run states to make it harder to cast ballots and easier to steal elections, which is rooted in ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s voter fraud lies. A parallel effort to restore portions of the Voting Rights Act protections to racial minorities, gutted over the last decade or so by the Supreme Court, will also likely founder in another right-wing victory over democratic values. The latest demonstration of the extraordinary power the 6-3 conservative majority on the court could wield over Democratic presidents for years took place with Republicans already laying plans to eviscerate Biden\u2019s White House next year. Certain they will capture the House at least in November\u2019s midterm elections, some GOP lawmakers are raising the possibility of impeaching Biden, and planning withering investigations against top administration officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci. The President\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, could find himself called to testify before Congress, in what would be an agonizing moment for his father and evidence the GOP would use its possible majorities as an unfiltered tool of revenge for Trump. Meanwhile, the Republican who wants to be the next speaker, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, offered his latest example on Thursday of the absurd political amnesia he is effecting to reinvent history and to cover up his criticisms of Trump over the January 6 insurrection, which he had delivered on the House floor a year ago on Thursday. McCarthy\u2019s sycophancy reflected the hold over the party of the twice-impeached ex-President, in the House especially, which could make Biden\u2019s political plight intolerable next year. And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s on-air humiliation at the hands of Fox demagogue Tucker Carlson \u2013 who seized on his comments that January 6 was a terrorist attack \u2013 showed the extent to which the extremist propaganda media machine behind Trump and his authoritarianism has the power to forcibly radicalize Republicans who want a future in the party. In another sign of the right\u2019s readiness to use its power to further rupture the traditions of democracy, the Republican Party signaled Thursday that it would force presidential candidates to refuse to debate under the auspices of the Commission on Presidential Debates without major revisions. In 2020, the Trump campaign released a list of potential debate moderators that included several who have since amplified his election fraud lies. There was a mini-revolt among GOP senators this week in support of Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who had committed the cardinal sin of pointing out the truth that Biden actually won the 2020 election. But Trump apologist and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham warned his longtime friend, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, that he must find a way to work with the ex-President. It\u2019s no secret the Kentucky Republican dislikes Trump, though he tolerated \u2013 and sometimes enabled \u2013 him between 2017 and 2021 to advance his own conservative goals. The Supreme Court\u2019s blocking of vaccine and testing requirements at large businesses struck at the heart of Biden\u2019s strategy for finally ending the pandemic as the highly infectious Omicron variant surges. More broadly, it devastates his attempt to use the powers of the federal government to combat the worst public health crisis in 100 years. The decision could also offer an opening for other conservative challenges against government authority on which the court might look favorably. In practice, the logic of epidemics also means the decision will slow attempts to stop the spread of the virus and cause more sickness and death. The question of the power of the relative branches of the US government is as old as the republic itself. The court essentially found that Congress hadn\u2019t given the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the authority to regulate public health in such a sweeping manner. White Houses often face court rebukes on executive power. Yet the case cannot be divorced from its political context. It was brought by Republican-run states that have spent the past year seeking to disable Biden\u2019s attempt to fight the virus. Multiple possible presidential hopefuls, including Govs. Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, have led the battle, clearly with their own political futures in mind. Nation's top trade groups hail SCOTUS ruling after filing emergency appeals against Biden's vaccine mandate The decision on mandates was also handed down by the most politicized Supreme Court in modern memory. The conservative majority is the project of a decades-long ideological quest on the right. There\u2019s nothing un-American about using elections and democratic majorities to change the balance of the court. But the final leap to that goal showed the kind of relentless and even illegitimate application of power and indifference to the principles of democracy with which Republicans have become synonymous. McConnell, for instance, has spent the week warning that Democrats will destroy the Senate if they change its rules to bypass the filibuster in order to enact voting rights bills by a simple majority. Yet he did much the same in a previous spell as majority leader, pushing through rules changes to allow Supreme Court justices to be confirmed on a majority vote and to bypass a Democratic filibuster. (Republicans followed similar changes to lower judicial confirmations made by former Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid, another hard-nosed power player, who died last month). But McConnell\u2019s move undoubtedly changed the Senate and escalated its partisan standoff. Republican hypocrisy is also glaring since McConnell built the conservative majority on the top bench by inventing a Senate principle to justify his refusal to confirm then-President Barack Obama\u2019s pick, Merrick Garland, during the Democrat\u2019s final year in office. He said the American people should decide who should fill the vacancy during an election. His obstruction paved the way for Trump to pick Justice Neil Gorsuch for the court after he took office. Then, days before the general election in 2020, McConnell ignored his own principle to seat Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a bulwark of the new conservative majority. McConnell\u2019s moves might be ruthless and against the spirit of democracy. But so far, Democratic leaders haven\u2019t come close to showing the same merciless capacity to maximize their power in order to enshrine long-held goals. In fact, they can\u2019t even get their own side on board. Both the voting rights push and Biden\u2019s massive climate change and social spending bill have been thwarted by the two moderates \u2013 Sinema and Manchin. Before visiting the White House, both senators indicated Thursday that they will not budge on the filibuster, despite Biden\u2019s warning this week that those who stand in the way of protecting democracy against a GOP onslaught are akin to segregationists. In a stunning show of defiance, Sinema took to the Senate floor Thursday to explain herself, just before Biden \u2013 a President of her own party \u2013 arrived on Capitol Hill to make his case. Manchin has provoked fury among Democrats because in a 50-50 Senate they cannot move major legislation without his vote. But his position can also be partially explained by the strength of conservatism. If it weren\u2019t for the West Virginian, the party wouldn\u2019t have a Senate majority since it fell short of its targets in congressional elections in 2020, with candidates who ran behind Biden in their races. And but for Manchin\u2019s 2018 victory in a state that Trump had won overwhelmingly two years earlier and has again since, they\u2019d be in even more trouble. Manchin hasn\u2019t said whether he will seek reelection. But clearly, the West Virginian\u2019s political choices now are being conditioned by the possibility he may have to run in 2024 in a state that rejected the Biden presidency \u2013 and possibly with Trump heading the Republican ticket. The difficulties that the Biden administration encountered in subverting Republican power, despite controlling Congress and the White House, are only a tepid preview of what life could be like after the midterm elections. If Republicans win the House and the Senate in November, Biden will be isolated in the White House, and under siege from a constant churn of investigations and attacks by Republican majorities. All White Houses should expect congressional scrutiny. But top GOP leaders are not even hiding their intention to scorch the political earth for a possible Trump presidential campaign in 2024. CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona and Manu Raju reported Thursday that the GOP is plotting a torrent of investigations. Republicans also appear determined to hold hearings to legitimize Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud and to whitewash the truth about the Capitol insurrection he incited. One of the key questions for a future Republican majority would be whether pro-Trump extremists would be so radical that they would give Biden a foil and Democrats a chance to run against rampant extremism in 2024. History suggests overreaching is likely. But in the longer term, Republicans may have such a grip on the mechanics of electoral power that Democrats might find it difficult to exploit such transgressions. And the conservative cast of the Supreme Court ensures that future Democratic majorities and White Houses will find wielding power effectively a constant battle.",

            "article_content": "Pressure is intensifying on President Joe Biden to articulate a plan to enact meaningful voter protections as a counter to strict new voting laws going into place around the nation after warning for the past year of nascent dangers to democracy. Biden heads to Atlanta on Tuesday to make an urgent new case for voting rights legislation as Democrats prepare to advance two new bills that will require a weakening of Senate filibuster rules in order to pass \u2013 a step Biden is prepared to endorse. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris \u2013 who asked Biden last year to take on voting rights as her signature issue \u2013 plan to lay a wreath at Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s crypt and visit the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the slain civil rights leader preached. Coming at a critical moment, the day is meant, in part, to quiet criticism that the President hasn\u2019t done enough to break a congressional logjam. That criticism is growing louder after a coalition of voting rights groups annoced Monday they would be boycotting the President\u2019s speech. The two measures \u2013 the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act \u2013 would jointly bolster voting protections by, among other things, creating national standards for mail-in voting and restoring some stripped-out elements of the Voting Rights Act. Biden\u2019s speech at the Atlanta University Center Consortium, on the grounds of the historically Black institutions Clark Atlanta University and Morehouse College, will work to galvanize support behind the bills as they come up in the Senate. Democrats in Congress are preparing to advance the bills ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections, but \u2013 with nearly all Republicans opposed \u2013 the measures\u2019 only chance of success is to alter the Senate\u2019s filibuster rules. Activists and some of Biden\u2019s allies are worried there is little hope of convincing the remaining Democratic holdouts \u2013 centrist Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona \u2013 to go for the rule changes and are growing increasingly frustrated with Biden for not breaking the impasse. Paired with his sharpest-to-date denunciation last week of his predecessor for fomenting lies about the 2020 election, the address Tuesday in Atlanta marks a distinct new focus for the President as he enters his second year in office. As Democrats enter an uncertain election year, Biden appears poised to wage a more sustained campaign against Republicans\u2019 attempts to rewrite election rules and install Trump loyalists on election boards. Ahead of his visit, some voting rights groups in Georgia voiced skepticism at the President\u2019s approach. A consortium of organizations wrote in a statement they would \u201creject any visit by President Biden that does not include an announcement of a finalized voting rights plan that will pass both chambers, not be stopped by the filibuster, and be signed into law.\u201d \u201cAnything less is insufficient and unwelcome,\u201d the statement read. Biden will be flanked by some Georgia elected officials on Tuesday. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who won his seat in 2020, will attend the event, a spokesperson for the senator said. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat who is up for reelection in 2022 after winning a two-year term alongside Biden and Ossoff in 2020, also will attend the presidential event, according to a representative for his Senate office. \u201cOur democracy is in peril and time is running out,\u201d Warnock said. \u201cThis is a moral moment, and if leaders in Washington fail to protect the voices and the votes of the American people, then we have fallen way short of our responsibilities. It\u2019s time to act.\u201d Prominent Georgia leader Stacey Abrams \u2013 arguably the Democratic Party\u2019s preeminent voting rights advocate after using her 2018 gubernatorial loss to Republican Brian Kemp to elevate the issue \u2013 will not attend Biden\u2019s speech due to a conflict, a spokesman said While it\u2019s not clear if the President will lay out that specific path, Biden will \u201cdescribe this as one of the rare moments in a country\u2019s history when time stops and the essential is immediately ripped away from the trivial,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. \u201cWe have to ensure January 6 doesn\u2019t mark the end of democracy, but the renaissance for our democracy.\u201d Biden\u2019s aides said he wasn\u2019t planning to concentrate on Trump again in Atlanta, believing last week\u2019s speech marking the anniversary of the January 6 US Capitol riot was a more appropriate venue to unleash his scathing criticism of his predecessor. But he does plan to home in on some of the same lines of critique he used in that address, including attacking Republicans for trying to reckon with the 2020 election results by tightening voting laws. \u201cInstead of looking at the election results from 2020 and saying they need new ideas or better ideas to win more votes, the former President and his supporters have decided the only way for them to win is to suppress your vote and subvert our elections,\u201d Biden said inside the Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s undemocratic and, frankly, it\u2019s un-American.\u201d The President has already stated he would back a rule change on the filibuster to pass voting rights bills \u2013 a significant acknowledgment for a longtime denizen of the Senate. But he hasn\u2019t specified exactly the parameters for the changes or laid out his reasoning in extensive detail. On Tuesday, he is preparing to spell out more clearly what those changes could look like, according to people familiar with his plans. Biden has previously stated he would support a return to the \u201ctalking filibuster,\u201d which requires a senator to remain speaking in the Senate for the duration. Biden\u2019s allies hope more forceful support for the filibuster revisions and a renewed focus on the voting issue can help sway the two Democratic holdouts to support the changes. But the likelihood of bringing Manchin or Sinema around appears low. Both have stated they oppose changes to the 60-vote threshold to pass legislation. Biden has been phoning senators over the past several weeks to discuss voting rights and to identify a pathway to passage, according to people familiar with the matter. After it became evident late last year that the President\u2019s Build Back Better bill wouldn\u2019t be passed in the near-term, Democrats began prioritizing voting rights legislation, setting a deadline of Monday\u2019s Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. \u201cMy sense is that with the White House, the game plan originally was to pass the rescue plan, pass the infrastructure plan and pass Build Back Better. They got two out of three and stymied on Build Back Better. So this definitely reflects a necessary and needed pivot by them to focus on democracy and focus on voting rights,\u201d said Marc Morial, the president of the National Urban League. Civil rights organizations have \u201cworked incredibly hard\u201d to push the President, vice president and members of the Senate \u2013 particularly Manchin and Sinema \u2013 on prioritizing voting rights legislation, Morial said. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re on the 1-foot line. And then sometimes I feel like we\u2019re 50 yards away,\u201d Morial told CNN. \u201cWe have been encouraging the White House for many months to use the full weight of the presidency\u201d to get behind the voting bills. Biden has delivered previous speeches on voting rights \u2013 including in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on the centenary of the race massacre there and more recently at a commencement address in South Carolina \u2013 but hasn\u2019t spelled out a distinct vision for overcoming Republican opposition to the proposed revisions. The speeches are wearing thin with some activists, as evidenced by the boycott announced Monday by a coalition of voting rights groups. The Asian American Advocacy Fund, Black Voters Matter Action Fund, GALEO Impact Fund, Inc., New Georgia Project Action Fund and Black Voters Matter announced ahead of Biden\u2019s visit that they will not attend. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another speech. What we need is a plan,\u201d Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, told reporters on Monday. \u201cWe won\u2019t be attending the speech that the President is giving tomorrow.\u201d Instead of attending the President\u2019s speech, Albright said, the groups will be continuing their work to advance voting rights in the state and plan to deliver a response to Biden\u2019s message on Tuesday. \u201cRight now in Georgia, organizations are busy fighting attacks against Black voters, Brown voters and voters all throughout the state of Georgia, from election board members to poll closers and even extreme racial gerrymandering,\u201d said James Woodall, former president of the Georgia NAACP. \u201cThe legislation that is currently pending both in Congress and the state legislature is our utmost priority and what we need is complete support from this administration to be able to support our democracy.\u201d Many voting rights advocates have lamented that Biden chose to focus so intently on other areas of his agenda during his first year in office. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, who has sat with both Harris and Biden on the issue last year, said she didn\u2019t believe Biden has made passing voting rights legislation a \u201cpriority.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve not seen evidence that the President has prioritized this. So hopefully tomorrow will be a change; it\u2019s never too late,\u201d she told CNN on Monday. Brown said she did not believe she would be attending the President\u2019s speech, \u201cbut we\u2019re way beyond speeches. At this point, I\u2019m looking for a strategy and I\u2019m looking for a commitment and that he is going to get this passed.\u201d Brown said she was disappointed at how long it\u2019s taken the administration to take this issue seriously: \u201cWhite voters get priority, Black voters get promises.\u201d The vice president\u2019s office has been lobbied by Democratic donors to increase her efforts on the issue, arguing her voice should be a louder part of the campaign to get something done, according to a source familiar with the matter, who said the pressure increased toward the end of last year after the sweeping spending plan faltered. The latest push on the issue will also include a renewed focus on corporations and chief executives, many of whom have spoken out in support of passing new voting rights protections. A source familiar with planning said the vice president\u2019s office had discussed organizing a roundtable with CEOs on the issue. Throughout her time in office, Harris has used her role for a series of speeches and meetings that have brought together prominent Black women, civil rights activists, poll workers and election officials to signal her commitment. For her, officials described voting rights as a nearly \u201c24/7\u201d issue. Both Brown and Morial commended Harris\u2019 leadership on the issue so far, identifying Biden as the President and being chiefly responsible for getting the bills passed. Still, Morial cheered Harris\u2019 increased leadership on the issue, saying she was an important asset to the agenda. \u201cHer very presence as vice president underscores the journey we\u2019ve been on to improve democracy and to expand democracy,\u201d Morial said. \u201cAnd why should we allow it to be retrenched right now? And I think she should be fully engaged or unleashed in this fight.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has set the stage for a showdown this month over voting rights \u2013 pledging to muscle through sweeping new federal legislation aimed at counteracting moves by Republicans in state capitols to restrict access to the ballot. But to do so, he must accomplish a near-impossible feat and persuade reluctant senators in his own caucus to change the chamber\u2019s rules to bypass the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome Republicans\u2019 repeated blockades of the bills. Despite supporting voting measures, two of his fellow Democrats \u2013 Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin \u2013 have defended the so-called filibuster, which requires 10 Republicans to support advancing legislation in an evenly divided 50-50 Senate. Time is running out for Democrats, who are racing to establish new ground rules for voting ahead of this year\u2019s midterm elections that will determine which party controls Congress. Republican-controlled legislatures, particularly in battleground states that saw increased turnout and Democratic victories in 2020, already have enacted a raft of new laws that limit absentee balloting, impose additional ID requirements and otherwise create new hurdles to voting. And more restrictions are likely to pass in upcoming state legislative sessions. Schumer has set a deadline of Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 17 to vote on rule changes if Republicans once again block consideration of the bills. The looming confrontation comes as some GOP leaders have begun to voice support for a more modest approach: updating an arcane 19th century law, known as the Electoral Count Act, that details how Congress counts Electoral College votes from each state. Schumer has insisted that an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act is no substitute for bigger electoral reforms. And President Joe Biden is expected to make the case for broader federal voting rights legislation when he travels on Tuesday to Georgia, a key political battleground and a cradle of the country\u2019s civil rights movement. As the Senate gears up to tackle voting rights, here\u2019s a look at the various legislative proposals and what they would do: This bill from a group of Democrats, including Manchin and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, sweeps into one place broad changes to election and campaign-finance laws. The goal is to set baseline rules that all states must follow in administering federal elections. Among its provisions: Making Election Day a public holiday, mandating same-day voter registration, guaranteeing that all voters can request mail-in ballots and restoring the federal voting rights for ex-felons once they are released from prison. It also seeks to safeguard against partisan takeovers of election administration, ban partisan gerrymandering of congressional districts and mandate disclosure of donors to deep-pocketed \u201cdark money\u201d groups that seek to influence elections. All 50 members of the Democratic caucus in the Senate back the bill; Republicans have rejected it as federal overreach. The bill, named for the late Georgia congressman and civil rights icon who died in 2020, would restore the power of the federal government to oversee state voting laws to prevent discrimination against minority voters. A 2013 Supreme Court decision gutted a central pillar of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which required nine states and parts of others with a history of racial discrimination to win approval or \u201cpreclearance\u201d from the US Justice Department or a federal judge before changing their electoral policies. Soon after the ruling, some states began enacting new voting laws, such as adding stricter voter identification requirements. And in the last year, Republican-led states have moved quickly to change more laws, spurred on by former President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless claims that widespread voter fraud led to his 2020 loss. The John Lewis bill would change the formula used to determine which states need to obtain \u201cpreclearance\u201d for their voting rules. It would extend preclearance coverage to states that have incurred multiple voting rights violations during the previous 25 years \u2013 an attempt to address the Supreme Court majority\u2019s concern that some states were being unfairly punished for decades-old misdeeds under the old law, rather than current discriminatory practices. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is the only Senate Republican to sign on to the bill. The 1887 law focuses on what happens after Americans vote, setting out the process Congress uses to certify the Electoral College votes submitted by the states. On January 6, 2020, then-Vice President Mike Pence resisted calls by Donald Trump and his allies to exploit perceived weaknesses in the act and insert himself into the vote-counting process to toss out Joe Biden\u2019s slate of electors. Pro-Trump rioters stormed the Capitol that day to stop the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Members of the select House committee investigating the January 6 attack on US Capitol have been looking at tightening the certification process as part of their work. But the idea of tweaking the act to make clear the the role of Vice President has gained more currency among Republican leaders in the Senate recently. Liberal activists have worried aloud that the new focus on changes to the Electoral Count Act might take pressure off lawmakers to pass the broader voting bills. \u201cThe Electoral Count Act is a fine reform,\u201d Ezra Levin, co-founder of the progressive group Indivisble, said in a statement, \u201cbut it would do nothing to reverse or prevent gerrymandering or voter suppression",

It\u2019s been a dramatic six months since the establishment of the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol Hill riot. Much of the committee\u2019s work to this point has taken place behind closed doors, and with an interim report not expected until the summer, the panel has drawn more headlines for the twists and turns of its plodding investigation than the revelations it\u2019s produced. But it hasn\u2019t been just closed-door interviews, document requests and legal showdowns. Here\u2019s some of the panel\u2019s work that has been made public: The select committee has information from multiple sources with firsthand knowledge that describe what then-President Donald Trump was doing during the riot, according to a person familiar with the investigation. \u201cThere\u2019s a collection of people with relevant information,\u201d the source told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel. One key witness who has given a deposition is Keith Kellogg, then-Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s national security adviser, who was with Trump in the White House when the riot was happening. The committee also has texts and other documents that shed light on what Trump was doing, according to the source. Some of those messages came from Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, who provided them to the panel. The House voted last month to refer Meadows to the Justice Department for criminal contempt of Congress after he failed to appear for a deposition. \u201cWe have significant testimony that leads us to believe that the White House had been told to do something,\u201d Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWe want to verify all of it so that when we produce our report and when we have the hearings, the public will have an opportunity to see for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I can say, it\u2019s highly unusual for anyone in charge of anything to watch what\u2019s going on and do nothing.\u201d Fox News host Sean Hannity was concerned about Trump\u2019s strategy and conduct before, during and after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, according to the panel. The committee said it has text messages from Hannity pushing back on the plan to urge Congress to challenge the certification of the election and urging Trump to prepare for his departure from office. According to the panel: Donald Trump Jr., Hannity and other Fox News personalities and lawmakers unsuccessfully implored Meadows on January 6 to get Trump to stop the violence unfurling at the US Capitol, according to text messages relayed by the House committee investigating the attack. The messages were read by committee members on the House floor before referring the criminal contempt of Congress against Meadows to the Justice Department. Trump Jr. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s got to condemn this sh*t ASAP. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough,\u2019\u201d Trump Jr. wrote in one message to Meadows, according to the committee\u2019s vice chairwoman, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming. Cheney detailed that when Meadows had texted back that he agreed, Trump Jr. said: \u201cWe need an Oval office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.\u201d People inside the Capitol, including lawmakers. The congresswoman also read aloud messages that she said had been sent between Meadows and people inside the Capitol complex during the attack: RELATED: Timeline of the coup: How Trump tried to weaponize the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election Fox News hosts. \u201cIndeed, according to the records, multiple Fox News hosts knew the President needed to act immediately,\u201d Cheney said, adding: \u201cThey texted Mr. Meadows, and he has turned over those texts.\u201d Other messages to Meadows revealed by Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California last month show correspondence before and after the 2020 presidential election centered on keeping Trump in power. Message about Jeffrey Clark. Schiff read a text from an unknown number that applauded the potential appointment of Jeffery Clark to be acting attorney general while Trump tried to get the Justice Department to support his false claims of election fraud. \u201cI heard Jeff Clark is getting put in on Monday. That\u2019s amazing. It will make a lot of patriots happy, and I\u2019m personally so proud that you are at the tip of the spear, and I could call you a friend,\u201d the text to Meadows read. Clark was one of the big proponents at the Justice Department of using the power of the department to investigate unfounded claims of voter fraud, but he was rebuffed by the department\u2019s leaders. Message suggesting \u2018aggressive\u2019 strategy. On November 4, 2020, the day after the election, Meadows received a text message suggesting an \u201caggressive strategy\u201d for Republican-led state legislatures to \u201cjust send their own electors\u201d to Congress and let the Supreme Court decide who had won the election. Members of the January 6 committee believe that Rick Perry, former Texas governor and energy secretary in the Trump administration, was the author of that message. A spokesman for Perry told CNN that he denies being the author of the text. Multiple people who know Perry confirmed to CNN that the phone number the committee has associated with that text message is his number. Elusive correspondence. Another text message from a member to Meadows underscored how the committee has not received everything from the former White House chief of staff. \u201cPlease check your signal,\u201d the January 5 message said, a reference to the encrypted messaging application Signal. The panel\u2019s first and only public hearing so far featured harrowing testimony from officers who experienced firsthand the violent events of January 6 at the hands of the pro-Trump mob. While a few of the officers had already shared their accounts of the attack publicly, their July testimony under oath brought the insurrection into chilling clarity. Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell. \u201cThe physical violence we experienced was horrific and devastating,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fellow officers and I were punched, kicked, shoved, sprayed with chemical irritants and even blinded with eye-damaging lasers by a violent mob.\u201d \u201cI was particularly shocked at seeing the insurrectionists violently attack us with the very American flag that they claimed they sought to protect,\u201d he said. DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone said he had been \u201cgrabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country\u201d and that he \u201cwas at risk of being stripped of and killed with my own firearm as I heard chants of \u2018Kill him with his own gun.\u2019 I can still hear those words in my head today.\u201d Taking aim at efforts to rewrite the history of the insurrection, he said, \u201cWhat makes the struggle harder and more painful is to know so many of my fellow citizens, including so many of the people I put my life at risk to defend, are downplaying or outright denying what happened.\u201d DC Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges described the rioters as \u201cterrorists\u201d and likened the mob to a \u201ccult,\u201d saying at one point during his testimony, \u201cTerrorists pushed through the line and engaged us in hand-to-hand combat. \u2026 One latched onto my face and got his thumb in my right eye, attempting to gouge it out. I cried out in pain and managed to shake him off.\u201d Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who is Black, testified that the rioters repeatedly targeted him with vicious racial slurs and called him the N-word. \u201cIn the days following the attempted insurrection, other Black officers shared with me their own stories of racial abuse on January 6,\u201d he said. At one point, he recalled growing emotional and yelling, \u201cIs this America?\u201d as he began sobbing while other officers tried to console him. The panel is working toward a goal of releasing an interim report with initial findings by the summer, a committee aide told CNN, with a final report following next fall. Committee members have said they hope to present more of their work in a public setting this year, which would include hearings that outline the story of what occurred on January 6. The specific timing of these hearings has not yet been set. The source said the timing of the release of these potential reports, which was first reported by The Washington Post, is subject to change. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a specific date,\u201d Thompson told CNN last month when asked when the panel would begin holding public hearings. \u201cBut we\u2019ll have some rolling hearings that will go on a good bit. It will be a nontraditional type of hearing.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. My husband, Jeff, and I have been together for nearly three decades. During this time, we\u2019ve been invited to a lot of weddings. We bring nice gifts! While each invitation has been joyfully received, none has been as impactful as the email we got last week. The upcoming ceremony to be held in our nation\u2019s capital was not just about two individuals but spoke to the commitment of a country to its citizens \u2013 and to what more is needed to make that commitment fully worthy of an all-out celebration. December 13, 2022, is a date to be remembered for generations: the day President Joe Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act, a bipartisan bill affirmatively recognizing and protecting marriages of same sex couples and of interracial couples at the federal level, a feat that seemed impossible only a few years ago. My husband and I were among the lucky guests invited to witness this historic signing held in the vastness of the White House\u2019s South Lawn. Opinion: The Senate just gave LGBTQ Americans a reason to breathe easier The festive gathering certainly felt like a real nuptial. The atmosphere was electric. People came in from all over the country. We flew in from Los Angeles on a redeye. We reconnected with friends whom we hadn\u2019t seen in person for years, heard great music, courtesy of Cyndi Lauper and Sam Smith and strained our necks to see the VIPs who had shown up. Most importantly, hope for a better future was in the air. All were there to celebrate (yes, they even played Kool & The Gang\u2019s wedding staple). Standing in the cold and listening to the President discuss his own journey on the issue of same-sex marriage made me reflect on what Jeff and I have been through in our relationship. Like all couples, we\u2019ve had our share of ups and downs (dealing with finances and family, figuring out where to live, even establishing the timeline for when we first met). While we\u2019ve done our best to navigate these common struggles, as a queer couple, we\u2019ve faced additional challenges imposed by our own government. The first came in 2008. During that election cycle, I was so busy serving on Barack Obama\u2019s Presidential campaign to help elect our nation\u2019s first bi-racial president that I didn\u2019t pay enough attention to Proposition 8, an initiative to limit the definition of marriage in the California constitution to heterosexual couples, especially since the polling looked like it was going to fail. Then in the fall, when proponents began scaring suburban moms with ads about the threat to their children, suddenly, we began to fear what if. Out of growing concern, Jeff and I held a shotgun wedding at the office of a public official we knew, attended only by his sister and young nephew and one of our closest friends. While we were happy to be able to tie the knot, we weren\u2019t celebratory. We didn\u2019t even go out for lunch. Watch Biden's speech before he signs same-sex marriage bill When Prop 8 narrowly passed the following week, out of respect for our friends and community who had suddenly lost that right, we cancelled any thought of having a more public reception or ceremony. No big Chinese wedding banquets for us. Outside of our immediate family and circle of friends, we told very few people about our changed relationship status. As our marriage stayed hidden in the closet, we still had to navigate a whole bunch of other things affected by government policy like hospital visits, taxes, and inheritance. Things came to head when we began exploring starting a family through the foster care and adoption system, only to face hurdles and disapproving judgment from a government case worker assigned to us. (I will save those gory details for another essay.) When the US Supreme Court decided the landmark case of Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015 guaranteeing the right to marriage for same-sex couples, we cheered. Finally, our government was being held accountable about the full meaning of justice for all. We were safe because we, our friends and the rest of the community now had court precedence on our side. And we became confident enough to come out as husbands. So many people were surprised to hear that we were legally wed. Still no gifts, but hey, we were happy just for the warm smiles. Life was good. Our families steadily grew to accept our marriage. We even sorted out the issue of how to present ourselves in tax returns. But, this summer, when the US Supreme Court \u2018s Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision overturned Roe v. Wade, it threw the concept of precedent out the door, immediately threatening rights that had been considered settled by the Court decades ago as well as ones more recently established. The longest-serving member of the Court, Justice Clarence Thomas, made this crystal clear in his concurring opinion, stating that in \u201cfuture cases, we should reconsider all of this Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence and Obergefell.\u201d We were left unsettled. We started to wonder again, what if.  Thankfully, the Respect for Marriage Act that Biden signed gives Jeff and me, and others like us who are already married or live in states where same-sex marriage is politically relatively safe, security from people who have no business in our relationship, those who are trying to deny us the benefits that they take for granted. As we get older, this law gives us peace of mind to focus on the things that matter: preparing for our future and retirement, taking care of parents, thinking about our nieces\u2019 and nephews\u2019 futures and so on. But, while this law is important, we \u2013 once again \u2013 can\u2019t quite fully celebrate. Like most weddings, after the celebration, the hard part of the relationship begins. This bill protects us at the federal level and for federal benefits, but if Thomas and the court\u2019s far-right majority do \u201creconsider\u201d the cases that establish rights to privacy, contraception and same-sex marriage, individual states (some of which have leaders who have expressed a clear interest in doing so) could be able to discriminate in how they define marriage, forcing residents who want to recognize their same-sex relationship through marriage to turn to states that don\u2019t discriminate. Just like women now have to do for their reproductive choices because of Dobbs. Only once we have firmly guaranteed that every American has the right to marry whom they choose \u2013 regardless of sexual orientation \u2013 can we fully celebrate.  Until then, we must continue to fight.",

He is the author of \u201cThe Third Reconstruction: America\u2019s Struggle for Racial Justice in the Twenty-First Century.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion on CNN. As a Black man, I found the US Senate race between Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker a particularly painful one to watch, observe and analyze. The assumption that a Black football player whose celebrated symbolism in Georgia would be enough to split the Black vote thankfully went unrealized, but the reality that a number of White Georgians were willing to support Walker underscores the troubling questions ahead for a country mired in division and bracing for former President Donald Trump\u2019s bid for his old office in 2024. I\u2019m relieved that Warnock, who serves as pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Sr. once led, defeated woefully unqualified Walker and claimed a full six-year term. His victory in a hotly contested race represents a triumph of substance over cynicism. Walker possessed absolutely no credentials to become the Republican Party\u2019s Senate nominee, other than being a famous former athlete friendly with Trump. Yet Walker, who starred as a running back during the early 1980s at the University of Georgia, turned this contest into a race to the bottom and ran a campaign whose toxic imprint won\u2019t fade away so easily. Backed by Trump (who reportedly personally recruited the Heisman Trophy winner to run against Warnock) and a MAGA movement running on fumes,  Walker served as an extreme manifestation of the ongoing misunderstanding and disrespect of the Black community by the Trump wing of the GOP. Opinion: Why Herschel Walker lost I grieve for the parts of America that enthusiastically embraced Walker\u2019s candidacy. Some people are hopelessly unaware of the negative message their support of him sent to millions of Black Americans, who won\u2019t soon forget it. The GOP embrace of Walker represents an American tragedy. Walker\u2019s behavior on the campaign trail included incoherent ramblings about movies and farm animals, nonsensical asides that went nowhere and dancing in front of overwhelmingly White audiences in bizarre scenes that recalled the minstrel shows of the Jim Crow era. The whiff of the Jim Crow era\u2019s objectification of Black men as intellectually feeble but physically powerful grew stronger as Walker\u2019s humiliating campaign continued to showcase the GOP\u2019s  failure to understand or connect with Black voters. Yet the allegations that Walker serially abused women, traumatized his son Christian (who has openly criticized his father\u2019s fitness for public office), engaged in extramarital affairs and pressured women into abortions did not prevent just over 48% of Georgians from supporting him. When pressed by reporters, Walker (who denied some of the allegations of violence against him and has cited mental health issues but hasn\u2019t denied being violent toward his wife) rejected the abortion allegations. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m done with this foolishness,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve already told people this is a lie.\u201d For too many White voters who remain enthralled by Trump, MAGA and January 6, Walker represents the only form of racial \u201cprogress\u201d they find acceptable \u2013 and that problem wasn\u2019t defeated at the polls the way Walker the candidate was. For too many of these voters, only a Black man who knows his \u201cplace\u201d\u2014 as a figurehead for a Republican Party openly pursuing a policy agenda of voter suppression, educational censorship and reproductive injustice \u2014 is worthy of the support of many parts of Georgia\u2019s electorate, a mere two years after George Floyd\u2019s murder sent the entire nation (and parts of the world) into a period of public rebellion and private introspection. White support for Walker sends the exact wrong message for America at this moment in our history, not simply about political parties or ideology but also about the direction of our country. Still, I found hope in Warnock\u2019s victory. While all the votes have yet to be counted, almost 100,000 more Georgians voted in support of a campaign whose belief in multiracial democracy represents ancestral dreams in action. Black women in particular proved key to Warnock\u2019s victory. Former Democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams\u2019 efforts in recruiting Warnock to become a candidate in 2020 and helping to organize the largest voting turnout campaign in the Peach State\u2019s history paid amazing dividends in 2022. The Warnock campaign\u2019s grassroots efforts helped to build the kind of multiracial coalition that would have made Dr. King proud. On January 5, 2021, Warnock became the first Black person elected to the US Senate from Georgia in American history. Alongside Jon Ossoff, who became the first Jewish senator ever elected from the state, these historic victories were overshadowed by the tragic circumstances that commenced the next day.  There is a uniquely American symmetry in what has followed in the almost two years since then. Trump\u2019s election denialism and toxic rhetoric have blinkered the GOP\u2019s political imagination and policy vision. If Warnock\u2019s surprise win in 2021 reflected the galvanizing power of the racial and political reckoning unleashed the previous summer, this hard-fought victory represents a clear moral rejection of the kind of cynical political environment that leads to candidates such as Walker in the first place. And that is reason enough to fully acknowledge the pain left behind by Walker\u2019s candidacy, and even more reason to celebrate Warnock\u2019s win as more than a partisan victory for the Democratic Party. It is a much-needed step toward realizing the dream of multiracial democracy.",

During the Trump administration, he was press secretary for the Department of Labor and deputy communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services. The views expressed here are their own. View more opinion on CNN. In 2016, when I worked for Donald Trump, I campaigned with him in dozens of states across the country. At nearly every rally or fundraiser, he closed by declaring, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win so much. You\u2019re going to get sick and tired of winning.\u201d It\u2019s unquestionable that the Trump administration, which I served in for two years, delivered a number of wins for the American people. Take, for example, its role in unleashing American ingenuity by rolling back burdensome regulations and signing the First Step Act, a major criminal justice reform bill, into law. Despite these wins, it\u2019s become increasingly apparent that many Republicans are growing sick and tired of Trump \u2013 and the losses his failed leadership has inflicted on the Republican Party in the last three election cycles. The reality is that no matter how Trump and far-right Republicans try to spin it, our party\u2019s performance in the most recent election was entirely underwhelming \u2013 and yet another referendum on the former President. The expected \u201cred wave\u201d turned out to be anything but. And aside from likely squeaking by with a slim majority in the House, Republicans lost gubernatorial seats, secretary of state races and, most notably, control of the United States Senate. Following this dismal performance, it\u2019s high time that we, as Republicans, engage in a period of introspection and reevaluate who we are as a party. We must reflect on what we stand for, and whether our party\u2019s standard bearer, who announced Tuesday that he is running for reelection again in 2024,  is currently leading us forward, rather than backward. Opinion: The voters sent a message to Trump and Biden More specifically, we must ask ourselves: Will we continue to be the party of divisiveness and conspiracy theories, dominated by the likes of Trump, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and failed-Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake? Or will the Republican Party finally part ways with them? We must seize this moment, in which more and more Republicans seem to be uniting together in our opposition to the former President, and restore principled leaders who prioritize integrity and exercise moral fortitude. And we must recognize that we have a stacked bench of candidates who are highly skilled, fit to serve and palatable with the general electorate \u2013 all of which Trump continues to prove time and time again he is not. Make no mistake, if the Republican Party intends to win back the White House in 2024, and if we take seriously our desire to reclaim solid majorities in both chambers of Congress, we must not embrace another Trump reelection bid. Instead, we must embrace a different leader who is capable of ushering in a new day for GOP politics by championing many of the traditional conservative policy positions \u2013 such as lowering taxes and supporting a strong military \u2013 which have come to define the party. We must renew our commitment to these principles while also addressing a host of issues that are important to millennial and Gen Z voters, such as LGTBQ+ rights, racial equity and the environment. Recognizing this now is especially important, considering recent CNN exit polls found that a majority of millennial and Gen Z voters supported the Democratic Party in this year\u2019s midterms. Opinion: A really bad night for some high-profile Trump-backed candidates For too long, we have catered to the far right and strayed further away from being what former President Ronald Reagan once dubbed the \u201cbig tent\u201d party. Considering the Republican base isn\u2019t getting any younger, it\u2019s high time we reevaluate our platform and more closely align it with the priorities of today\u2019s electorate. While Trump may be the first to declare his presidential run, and while it remains unclear who will mount a challenge against him, after his victory in Florida last week, many view Gov. Ron DeSantis as a favorite to take on the former President. The Florida governor was propelled to victory by, among other things, making inroads with key demographic groups that typically favor Democrats, including Latino voters and White women. Aside from DeSantis, who easily won his recent reelection bid but is regularly criticized by the left for his use of Trump-like inflammatory and divisive rhetoric, speculation is also swirling around former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who has  significant experience in foreign policy and a staunch fiscal conservative. Either of these candidates, along with Trump\u2019s former Vice President, Mike Pence, who is said to be considering a run for the presidency, could deliver on many of the fiscal policies in place under the Trump administration, while also restoring decency and a respect for the office that suffered under the former President.  Though it\u2019s too early to tell who else might declare, one thing is clear: This moment is ours. We can choose to move forward together unified as one party, or we can remain divided and beholden to one man who has proven time and time again that he will put his own interests ahead of the country\u2019s. To my fellow Republicans and my former colleagues, it\u2019s time to do what\u2019s right. And to those who remain on the fence, I simply ask: Are you tired of losing yet? Let\u2019s move on from Trump \u2013 or rest assured we\u2019ll be having this same conversation in the days following the 2024 presidential election.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This roundup is part of the CNN Opinion series \u201cAmerica\u2019s Future Starts Now,\u201d in which people share how they have been affected by the biggest issues facing the nation and experts offer their proposed solutions. The views expressed in these commentaries are the authors\u2019 own. Read more opinion at CNN. There are many problems roiling America\u2019s public schools, including culture wars that have found their way into the classroom, school libraries and school board meetings over the past several months. But some challenges are more endemic, the product of decades of low pay and lack of appreciation for the service that administrators and teachers perform. CNN Opinion gathered the views of nine experts in the field of education about the problems they feel should be most urgently addressed in the classroom \u2013 and what solutions might be viable in our tumultuous political times. Last year, Democratic Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe lost his reelection campaign, at least in part because his Republican opponent, Glenn Youngkin, repeatedly declared that McAuliffe\u2019s reelection would lead to the widespread teaching of critical race theory in schools across the Commonwealth. Simply put, attacking critical race theory helped the now-governor of Virginia secure his win. Critical race theory is a set of concepts seeking to explain the structural underpinnings of inequality and racism in the United States. But the term has been attacked by its critics as unfairly pinning blame on White Americans for some of society\u2019s most pernicious ills. Classroom discussions about race, and what I like to call \u201ctruth teaching,\u201d haven\u2019t been as much of a talking point as they were a year ago, and critical race theory isn\u2019t being debated as much in this year\u2019s midterm campaigns. It doesn\u2019t have to be. For the most part, conservatives have already succeeded in banishing talk about racism from the classroom. After a campaign of intentional misinformation and fear mongering, critical race theory quickly became one of our nation\u2019s most contested and misunderstood education issues. Conservative strategists successfully convinced millions of Americans, including concerned parents of school-aged children, that it was being taught in K-12 districts across the country. No evidence exists to confirm that this was actually the case. As of last month, elected officials in 42 states have introduced legislation that broadly aims to ban the teaching of racial and social justice topics in public schools, according to data compiled by Education Week. Similar bills have passed in 17 of those states. Many more school boards have enacted local bans. In addition, books about race have been banned in numerous districts. The campaign to eliminate critical race theory succeeded mostly because White parents and state lawmakers were led to believe that White school children were being made to feel badly about being White. Where\u2019s the proof that teachers, nearly 80% of whom are White, were doing this? They weren\u2019t, certainly not in any widespread fashion. With no credible evidence of an actual problem and no opportunity to vote on the issue, citizens who recognize the value of teaching our children the truth about America\u2019s racial past and present won\u2019t have a voice in the upcoming election. There\u2019s at least one state where voters will decide this fall what gets taught in the classroom. West Virginians will consider a ballot question known as the Education Accountability Amendment, which if passed, would amend the state constitution to give the majority-Republican legislature more control over just about every aspect of public schooling. Until bans on truth teaching are lifted, our democracy will become increasingly susceptible to the exacerbation of the racial tensions, inequities, injustices and violent acts of racism that have always kept America from reaching its full potential. Educators, meanwhile, will have unchecked authority to lie to school children about race. One recent example of this is educators\u2019 failed attempt to change slavery to \u201cinvoluntary relocation\u201d in Texas schools. Those who truly care about the advancement of our democracy must insist that its full truth be taught. Unfortunately, we may have to wait a while before that discussion resumes in our public schools. Shaun Harper is a professor at the Rossier School of Education and the Marshall School of Business at the University of Southern California. His research focuses primarily on race, gender and equity in the classroom and in the workplace. He tweets @DrShaunHarper. I\u2019m a middle school social studies teacher in New Hampshire and an avid supporter of public education. Having taught for over 20 years, my greatest joy is participating in a democratic institution that is for everyone. I stand for all my students by committing myself to perpetual learning and growth. I continue to update instructional strategies, let go of old projects that no longer serve my current students and adapt my curriculum and language to ensure my approaches are culturally sensitive. I teach well-rounded history to the best of my ability as I continually strive to keep my background knowledge robust. I am here to hold space for all my students regardless of their identity, political positions or other affiliations. To do this, I must rigorously and regularly examine my biases, consider what and whom I am centering and why. That\u2019s why it was so disheartening to see laws like House Bill 2 (sometimes referred to as the \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d law) pass in New Hampshire. The disrespect and lack of trust it communicates to the hundreds of honorable educators I know and work with cannot be overstated. The measure, formally known as the Right to Freedom from Discrimination in Public Workplaces and Education bill, was written with the mistaken idea that discrimination is somehow endorsed or practiced in public spaces and classrooms. The new law bars educators from teaching that any particular group is inherently racist, sexist or otherwise oppressive. It purports to promote teaching about people without regards to their race, gender, disability or other differences. But the language is so vague that it discourages teachers from having classroom conversations about race, racism and discrimination. Legislation like HB2 and similar laws in other states are obstacles to growth, student well-being and compassionate practices. HB2 prohibits schools in New Hampshire from creating mandatory equity training for faculty because someone might \u201cfeel bad.\u201d Because I teach social studies, I\u2019ve developed a healthy resilience around complex conversations and divergent opinions. My entire career has been centered around navigating one tricky topic or another. I\u2019ve mediated dialogues around presidential elections, the events of September 11, different wars and conflicts, and facilitated a variety of debates. Through it all, I\u2019ve dedicated myself to building a foundation of trust, joy, understanding, respectful discourse, care and acceptance in my classroom. Some of us are finding that harder to achieve under the new legislation. For example, a colleague who teaches in a nearby school district was told that if she openly said slavery was a \u201cbad practice,\u201d she must make it clear to her students that she is expressing an \u201copinion.\u201d It\u2019s an experience other teachers in my state have spoken about as well. At what point did we decide it\u2019s divisive to take a stance on cruel and dehumanizing activities? Who are we harming by taking a hardline on the concept of slavery? Our silence is an endorsement. That is our ethical crisis. That is what fear-mongering yields. Teachers deserve better: Shame and blame have been imposed upon a profession that is filled with loving, kind, compassionate and principled people. Choosing a career in education is almost always driven by a heart-centered desire to make a positive difference. I have never encountered a teacher in four districts, two states and 22 years who displayed devious political intentions. The conflation of equity and inclusion work with \u201ccritical race theory\u201d has led to wildly inaccurate and unfounded accusations. This \u201cthreat\u201d has taken seed in the imaginations of some legislators and families. Future voters must understand that disagreement is normal and healthy. Changing your mind in light of new evidence is logical and admirable. Nothing could be more American, patriotic or democratic than striving for a more just society. Feeling discomfort and dissonance often accompanies growth and learning; this is something I strive to normalize for my students. Teachers teach critical thinking and analysis by asking students to wrestle with challenging ideas and evidence. At some point, we have confused feeling uneasy with a lack of safety. There is a crucial difference. Poorly constructed laws were drafted to stop good, productive work under the guise of being \u201canti-critical race theory\u201d and have resulted in the oppression of free thought, critical thinking and children. I know we can do better. My message to lawmakers? Trust teachers. Asking them to be thoughtful, sensitive and inclusive is always reasonable. You\u2019ll find that\u2019s what they generally already are. Valerie Wolfson, a middle school social studies teacher, was named the 2020 New Hampshire Social Studies Teacher of the year. Public schooling struggles with diversity. From early battles over the Bible to current fights over race, gender identity, prayer and more, public schooling \u2013 in which all must fund a single system of government schools \u2013 inevitably pits people with diverse values, needs and backgrounds against each other. But why are conflicts burning especially hot now? Covid-19 set the conditions, creating clashes over in-person instruction and masking that many saw as having literally life-and-death stakes. The murder of George Floyd added fuel, prompting many public school officials to target systemic racism \u2013 discrimination built into American institutions \u2013 and conservatives to demand colorblindness and an emphasis on America\u2019s basic goodness. Graphic novels, such as \u201cGender Queer,\u201d with graphic depictions of sexual activity, and other books on hot-button topics sparked dueling accusations of \u201chate\u201d and \u201cindoctrination.\u201d This all happened amid rapid demographic and social change. In 2000, the US population was 71% non-Hispanic white. By 2020, that was down to about 58%. Gay marriage support skyrocketed from 27% of Americans in 1996 to 77% in 2021, while the share of people belonging to a church, synagogue or mosque plummeted from 70% in 1999 to 47% in 2020. What can deescalate education politics? Not \u201cparents\u2019 rights,\u201d a term that can encompass useful things like requirements that districts share curriculum information, but sometimes seems invoked so that just one group of parents will get what it wants. Giving parents more say does nothing to change a system that forces diverse people, including parents, to fund \u2013 and fight to control \u2013 government-run schools. Freedom is the answer: Attach money to students \u2013 as many other countries do \u2013 and let families choose among diverse options. This can be accomplished through universal education savings accounts, such as Arizona recently enacted, scholarship tax credits and other choice vehicles. Regardless of how it is done, the goal of choice is to enable diverse families to access education they think is right rather than forcing neighbor to defeat neighbor to control public schools. Neal McCluskey directs the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute and is the author of \u201cThe Fractured Schoolhouse: Reimagining Education for a Free, Equal, and Harmonious Society.\u201d American students\u2019 steady progress in reading and math has become the latest casualty of the Covid-19 era. In the first results since the pandemic began, the 2022 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) showed steep declines in the math and reading scores of fourth- and eighth-grade students. It\u2019s not hard to see why. The pandemic has disrupted three years of students\u2019 lives. More than 200,000 children in the United States are grieving the loss of at least one parent to Covid-19. The economic fallout of the pandemic exacerbated food and housing insecurity. People were, and still are, stressed and scared. And remote learning has always been an inadequate substitute for in-person instruction, although NAEP results show comparable drops in student performance in school systems that were quicker to reopen. Some critics see this as a chance to point fingers and to use kids as political pawns. We see it as an urgent call to institute short-term and long-term investments and proven strategies to support students\u2019 emotional development and to accelerate learning, especially for Black and Latino students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, who were underserved and behind their peers prior to the pandemic. What we must not allow is for students and educators to be dragged into bad-faith battles over bathroom access and participation on sports teams as an unwelcome distraction from ensuring that every student receives a great education and the supports needed to thrive academically and socially. The good news is that we know what works from research and experience, and there is historic federal funding to accelerate learning and to start to remedy long-standing inequities. Resources from the Biden administration\u2019s American Rescue Plan and the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund can be directed so students have better access to experienced, diverse and certified teachers, high-quality summer and after-school programs, engaging and relevant curriculums and mental health supports. Both our organizations are engaged in longer-term strategies to address the needs of kids, families and communities, but there are interventions that can help students right now. In the short term, targeted, intensive tutoring has large positive effects on both math and reading achievement. Teachers tend to be the most consistently effective tutors; however, recent studies have found that paraprofessionals (teaching assistants), AmeriCorps volunteers and others who are trained to support student learning can be just as effective when tutoring one-on-one or in small groups. Many states are using state and federal funds to invest in strategies to increase the diversity of the workforce. Access to a racially and culturally diverse teacher workforce is beneficial for all pre-K-12 students, particularly for students of color, who often thrive in classrooms led by teachers who share their racial and cultural background. The pandemic\u2019s impact on children cannot be measured by assessments alone. But we hope that the alarm over the steep drop in NAEP scores creates urgency to address the conditions that contributed to the decline, many of which far predate the pandemic. Educators didn\u2019t need to see declines in test scores to know what to do right now: focus like a laser on helping our kids recover and thrive. Safety was required to return to in-person teaching and learning. Now is the time to double down on proven strategies, using the resources we are fortunate to have, to deliver on a promise the US has not yet fulfilled\u2014providing every child access to a high quality public education, without exception.

It should come as no surprise that parents have been fighting for their rights so vociferously when it comes to public education. They\u2019re fighting because they sense that those rights are under attack. It started with the lockdowns in 2020. For the first time, many parents suddenly saw, courtesy of online conferencing apps like Zoom, what their kids were being taught. And they didn\u2019t like it: Toxic and divisive ideas about race \u2013 disguised as lessons on slavery and racism \u2013 contradicted the belief in racial equality that most Americans \u2013 whatever their politics \u2013 shared with civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. But critical race theory is far less shocking than the radical gender ideology that seems to have overtaken our nation\u2019s schools. It teaches children that \u201csome people are boys, some people are girls, some people are both, neither, or somewhere in between\u201d\u2019 \u2013 as one popular children\u2019s book puts it. Schools are promoting the notion that some kids \u2013 perhaps many kids if recent trends continue \u2013 are born in the wrong body. Suddenly, from Florida to Texas to Wyoming, parents are discovering that schools are teaching, seemingly across the curriculum, that an internal sense of gender trumps biological sex. Worse, some schools are changing, at their students\u2019 request \u2013 but without their parents\u2019 knowledge or consent \u2013 their students\u2019 names and pronouns to conform to a child\u2019s surprising new \u201cgender identity.\u201d When parents come to school board meetings to complain, far too many are met with silence or risible accusations that they are politicizing education. Parents have the primary right and responsibility to raise and teach their children. Many parents delegate part of the teaching task to schools, in an act of trust. Rather than acting as faithful stewards of that trust, too many schools have decided that it\u2019s their job to alienate kids from \u201cregressive\u201d views of their parents. Is it any wonder that this has proved controversial? We could dissipate some of the heat by increasing the rights of parents over their children\u2019s schooling. States should connect school money to children, rather than to school buildings. Universal school choice for everyone \u2013 rich and poor, conservative and liberal \u2013 would not just make schools better and more competitive. It would make them less of an arena for the culture war that is otherwise roiling our culture. Jay Richards is the William E. Simon Senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, where he is also director of the Richard and Helen DeVos Center for Life, Religion, and Family. Book bans and censorship debates have always existed, but America\u2019s children are facing an unprecedented moment in history. Today, school resources are stretched thin, schools are facing teacher and staff shortages and districts are still grappling with the long-term effects of the pandemic on student learning, as individuals\u2019 rights to quality education are under increasing threat. Important investments toward providing more supports for teachers, classroom aid and salary increases \u2013 such as by passing the RAISE Act \u2013 are needed now more than ever. That measure would provide teachers tax credits totaling\n            \n                 as much as $15,000 each year. Rather than addressing the real challenges facing teachers, many MAGA extremists have taken aim at books, racial and gender inclusion and more. Defunding the Department of Education, an ongoing federal level tactic among other changes in public school funding, should not be a topic of debate. However, it has also been central to MAGA Republicans\u2019 federal policy agenda and could have devastating consequences for students nationwide. While parents are working with teachers and librarians to ensure that every child is acknowledged in school curricula and has a chance to thrive in school, regardless of who they are or where they live, far-right MAGA extremists are increasingly running for vacant school board seats or for reelection to gain control and power over decision-making at all levels of government. Students and teachers want safer schools that reflect the diversity of their families and teach truthful history. They can be best supported through policy making that increases equity and understanding in our school systems by supporting their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights, not denying them. Akilah Alleyne is the director for K-12 Education at the Center for American Progress, a think tank in Washington, DC. Public schools educate approximately 90% of young Americans. The society we are, and the one we will become, is profoundly shaped by public education. It has made America more inclusive, improving outcomes across lines of race, gender and ability status. The result has been overwhelming bipartisan support for public schools over generations. But the evidence of a crisis in our public schools is overwhelming: Hundreds of thousands of students have disappeared from school rolls, derailing their futures and foreshadowing budget woes when emergency Covid-19 relief funds expire. The Nation\u2019s Report Card reported historic declines in reading and math scores, not surprising given pandemic disruptions. What\u2019s more, educator morale is low, exacerbating staff shortages. Classrooms are targets in the culture wars, leading to book bans and speech codes that never end well. Young people report epidemic levels of anxiety and depression. The pandemic and broader turmoil afflicting the nation have left public education in peril. Every one of us has a stake in reversing this decline because, whether we\u2019re talking about growing the economy or strengthening democracy, every path to redeeming the promise of America runs through public schools. Addressing lost learning is important, and so is addressing the lack of trust in public education. Public education has played an enormous societal role: In the 19th century, common schools forged shared identity when government of the people, by the people, for the people was a novel idea. In the 20th century, universal high school fueled the growth of the middle class. Over the last several decades, the broad vision that propelled America\u2019s public schools has dwindled into a narrow, technocratic policy frame. \u201cA Nation at Risk,\u201d a major report on education released by the Reagan administration in 1983, used fear-based arguments to argue that reading and math test scores were essential for national security. This logic eventually transformed test scores from one critical indicator (which they are) to the very purpose of public schools (which they are not). Early accountability reforms led to gains among low-income students and students of color, but progress plateaued a decade ago. Test-and-accountability reforms over-promised and under-delivered and no longer command broad bipartisan support. Renewing the promise of public education starts by rebuilding trust. Local education leaders were left holding the bag on school closings that should have been shared with health officials and political leaders. Schools were expected to arrange meals, computers and broadband access \u2013 burdens they often shouldered alone. This was thrust on school systems where teachers already felt beleaguered and disrespected; in truth, our schools have operated in a low-trust environment for years. This led to schools being closed for far too long with continuing consequences, not only in diminished learning but also in diminished public support. We must recommit to the mission of public education. The Aspen Institute recently convened a bipartisan group of state policymakers to ask: What do we want to be true about the opportunities our public schools offer? After reflecting on values and reviewing research, these policymakers authored \u201cOpportunity to Learn, Responsibility to Lead.\u201d The principles they developed refocus attention on the core purposes of education in a diverse democracy and market-driven economy. It presents an evidence-informed vision for schools as engines of opportunity, which could galvanize the political middle to coalesce around a more positive approach. State leaders should call for a public conversation about the future of their state and the role of public education in realizing that future. Unspent federal Covid-19 relief can be a perfect catalyst for this work. Grants to community-based organizations and PTAs, after-school providers, 4-H Clubs and faith-based youth groups can support stakeholders in articulating what they want to be true about their public schools and identifying opportunities in their communities. Universities, chambers of commerce and other civic organizations can use their own resources to sponsor similar inquiries. Experience demonstrates there is much common ground to be found in efforts to strengthen public schools. Channeling Americans\u2019 shared commitment to opportunity is the ideal antidote to the cynicism and division currently plaguing the policy and politics of public education. Ross Wiener is executive director of the Education & Society Program at the Aspen Institute and the author of \u201cWe Are What We Teach.\u201d Teacher shortages are not new, especially in schools serving predominantly students from low-income backgrounds, who are disproportionately young people of color. Yet cracks in the system before the pandemic have become gaping crevasses: In February 2022, there were nearly 600,000 fewer educators in public schools than there were in January 2020, and National Center for Education data showed less than half of schools serving majority Black and brown students were fully staffed. The organization I lead, Teach For America, has 33 years of experience attracting talented individuals early in their careers to teach in rural and urban classrooms. Our research into the priorities of current college students finds that they want to have an impact on what matters most in the world, and the issue of quality education for all children is in their top five. However, they also want to preserve their mental health and have financial stability, and the teaching profession\u2019s low pay and structures that challenge work-life balance are deterrents \u2013 especially when the average student-loan debt is nearly $30,000 and many other professions offer flexible schedules and remote work options. This disconnect affects the profession at large, which has been struggling for years. Between 2008 and 2019, the number of graduates from traditional teacher education programs fell by more than a third. We can tackle these issues in a number of ways: by increasing teacher pay; creating financial incentives for effective educators to teach in schools serving low-income communities; expanding student loan forgiveness for teachers, especially in hard-to-staff schools and subjects; ensuring teachers\u2019 have sufficient resources and planning time, proper administrative help and the support of counselors and nurses; and fostering educator wellbeing by offering mental health supports and addressing sources of occupation-related stress. These policies and practices will make teaching more desirable and accessible and will work to increase the racial, ethnic and socioeconomic diversity of the teaching workforce, a move that research shows has a positive impact for students. As essential as these efforts are, they are not sufficient to address teacher shortages in the long term. Our country must think boldly at this moment about another problem that needs solving: What if the real issue is not that young adults don\u2019t want to teach, but that the purpose of education has changed drastically and our education system has not kept up? What if we\u2019ve reached the limits of this outmoded system and the conventional role of the teacher? It\u2019s time to expand the traditional definition of learning to include all the skills and mindsets that students want and need to thrive in our 21st century world and careers of the future: qualities like developing empathy, sustaining mental health and wellbeing, building relationships and applying learning to solve real-world problems. Redefining learning opens the door to a more diverse set of adult leaders to work alongside educators and students: professionals in various fields who can support the development of students\u2019 workplace skills; college students who can support digital literacy and serve as tutors and mentors; and any number of community leaders who can support students\u2019  sense of belonging.  For example, technology could allow expert educators to teach multiple classes virtually while a colleague who is expert in creating productive learning spaces \u2013 where every student is valued and feels they belong \u2013 focuses there. Many teachers excel at both roles \u2013 we just don\u2019t have enough of them to staff every classroom in our country. This shift is not only about making teachers\u2019 jobs more sustainable, but also about positioning teachers to further develop their areas of greatest expertise. Fundamental changes of this magnitude don\u2019t happen quickly. But, for too long, we\u2019ve expected teachers to carry the weight of an outmoded education system. We can\u2019t just replenish this system. We must redefine what and how students learn and reimagine the role of the teacher to inspire a new generation of purpose-driven young people to get involved and reinvent the system for a stronger, more equitable future.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. This Sunday more than 120 million Brazilians went to the polls to vote in a run-off presidential election in which former President Luiz In\u00e1cio \u2018Lula\u2019 da Silva posted a stunning political comeback. Lula beat incumbent President Jair Bolsonaro with 50.9% of the vote against Bolsonaro\u2019s 49.1% \u2013 a difference of roughly two million of the eligible votes cast. It was a nail-biter of an election with the final result coming only after nearly all of the votes from the country\u2019s 577,000 electronic voting machines had been tabulated. On one hand, Lula\u2019s victory marked a sharp rebuke of Bolsonaro\u2019s irreverent and often-times controversial governing style, which earned him the derisive moniker as the \u2018Trump of the Tropics.\u2019 Not only was Bolsonaro in fact endorsed by former US President Donald Trump, but like Trump, he was widely criticized for his handling of the coronavirus which resulted in nearly 700,000 deaths in the country, according to the World Health Organization. Moreover, Bolsonaro\u2019s aggressive anti-LGBT agenda, decidedly anti-environmental policies and authoritarian tendencies made him something of a pariah in the international media. Lula, who previously served two terms as president from 2003 to 2010, also brought his fair share of baggage to this election. In fact, if it were not for his conviction being annulled on a jurisdictional technicality for his role in \u201cOperation Car Wash\u201d \u2013 one of the largest public corruption scandals in the world \u2013 Lula would still be serving out his 12-year prison sentence. Not since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s have Brazilians been faced with two more starkly contrasting candidates, each with diametrically opposing political outlooks for the country. Arick Wierson His detractors have feared that his return to public office might usher in a new wave of large-scale graft and inefficiency with Brazil\u2019s economically relevant state-owned companies. Not since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s have Brazilians been faced with two more starkly contrasting candidates, each with diametrically opposing political outlooks for the country. And with Lula winning by a little over two million votes while around five million votes were purposely left blank or spoiled by voters, it\u2019s clear that a sizable percentage of the voting population didn\u2019t buy into either of their visions for the country. Although it\u2019s still early, fears that Bolsonaro might not accept the results or even stage a coup are quickly dissipating as even pro-Bolsonaro conservative media is accepting the results. That\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that, now come January 1, when Lula is sworn in for his third term as President, he will have to find a way to govern a country that is deeply divided and highly mistrustful of the other side. Unlike in his past victories where Lula came into office with a clear mandate, winning over 60% of the votes in both 2002 and 2006, this time not only did Lula eke out a the slimmest of victories, but he will face a congress that is still very much aligned with Bolsonaro. In fact, in the first-round election in early October, allies of the current president took a plurality of seats in both the lower chamber as well as the Senate. Moreover, with the down-ballot results of Sunday\u2019s run-off elections for governorships across the country, it\u2019s clear that allies of Bolsonaro will be in power in 14 of Brazil\u2019s 27 states including the most economically important states of S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. And it\u2019s in this context that Lula will have to confront seismic challenges on multiple fronts. Brazil has been in something of an economic freefall since the onset of the pandemic and has yet to fully recover. Hunger has reemerged as a pressing social concern while racial inequities have been exacerbated in recent years. Urban violence continues to terrorize cities across the country and systemic corruption is still rampant. Perhaps most importantly for the rest of the world, Brazil\u2019s role in the fight against global warming is undeniable \u2013 the country is home to a large part of the Amazon rainforest. Under Bolsonaro, deforestation of the Amazon surged. Lula meanwhile, highlighted the need to protect the rainforest in his victory speech, saying his administration would \u201cfight for zero deforestation.\u201d That said, mobilizing the requisite political force needed to address these issues in this country of 215 million will be anything but easy. But if there is a silver lining to Lula\u2019s victory it is that both regional powers and financial markets seem to be willing to extend a hand in helping the incoming president as he pursues his governing agenda. Lula will be embraced with open arms by many of Latin America\u2019s leftist leaders who have been propelled to victory in recent years, as well as across global financial markets where investors are cautiously bullish on the growth prospects of a Lula-led Brazil. Lula would be wise to lean into these international partnerships as he begins to form a government. But perhaps most importantly, Lula\u2019s success \u2013 and that of the country as well \u2013 will likely hinge on the president\u2019s well-honed political skills and his ability to extend an olive branch to key political leaders who supported Bolsonaro as he looks to build a coalition that can help him bring his political agenda to fruition.  There is already talk on Brazil\u2019s right about impeaching Lula \u2013 a very real possibility with ample historical precedent given that two of out of the eight presidents Brazil has had since the country\u2019s return to democracy in the 1985 were removed from office before the end of their terms. The stakes are high for Brazil. And the stakes are high for Lula, not only politically but personally as well.

The views expressed in these commentaries are the authors\u2019 own. Read more opinion at CNN. Though Americans don\u2019t agree on many political issues, there is one issue both Democrats and Republicans acknowledge poses a major problem: the state of American democracy. According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll, 69% of Democrats and 69% of Republicans think the nation\u2019s democracy is on the brink of collapse. And the figure for independents, 66%, isn\u2019t much better. This fear, if actualized, would have ripple effects around the world, given that so many nations look to the United States to be a global leader in democratic efforts. But it also has very real implications for our country\u2019s immediate domestic politics and policy \u2013 as evidenced by the recent attacks against election officials across the country. The threats after the 2020 presidential election were so serious, writes Philadelphia City Commissioner Lisa Deeley, that \u201cI had two plain-clothes Philadelphia police officers assigned to follow me wherever I went \u2013 including the bathroom.\u201d We turned to a group of experts and asked what can be done to fix what is broken and restore faith in democracy. Social psychologist Muzafer Sherif brought two highly similar groups of 11- to 12-year-old boys to Oklahoma\u2019s Robbers Cave State Park in 1954. His intention was to study how hostilities arise between groups. The boys arrived on separate buses and camped in different areas. One group decided to call themselves the Eagles; the other, the Rattlers. When the groups met, they fell into conflict. First, there was verbal sparring and then physical confrontation. Sherif changed the terms of the experiment. He didn\u2019t bring the boys around a campfire to express their feelings \u2013 polite chatter wasn\u2019t the answer. Sherif gave both groups a problem to solve. He had jammed the camp\u2019s water supply. If the boys wanted water, they would have to work together to fix the jam. The boys collaborated on several problems. The hostilities dampened, and they stopped calling each other names. Several even asked if they could ride home together on the same bus. Since the mid-1970s, Americans have been self-segregating. We live in neighborhoods, go to churches, read news and join clubs that are increasingly politically homogenous. We even date and marry within our chosen party. We are Rattlers and Eagles \u2013 and the consequences in 2022 are the same as in 1954. What can we do? Mandatory national service. For a year or two, we would join others \u2013 a tossed salad of class, race, religion, party and way of life \u2013 to work on a problem facing the country. Not talk \u2013 do. It could be through military service or a new version of the Appalachian Volunteers, the Peace Corps or Civilian Conservation Corps. But everyone at some point \u2013 Rattlers and Eagles \u2013 would have to work together to make the United States a better place. Studies of World War II support the notion that working together reduces tensions between groups that might otherwise be hostile toward one another. White troops who fought alongside Black soldiers held less racial animus post-war. The same was true with White merchant marines who served with Black sailors. So let\u2019s carry that lesson into the present day. And when our time of service is up, we just might choose to ride the same bus home together. Bill Bishop is author of \u201cThe Big Sort: Why the Clustering of Like-Minded America Is Tearing Us Apart.\u201d Democracy is broken because\u202four trust is broken. From\u202foverturning access to reproductive rights to upholding state laws that suppress the right to vote, federal courts \u2013 in particular, the Supreme Court \u2013 keep making decisions that most Americans simply do not support. It\u2019s only natural that this would erode trust. But it\u2019s not just that some of these decisions call the rule of law into question \u2013 it\u2019s that it appears our judiciary isn\u2019t really listening to how the law is lived for each and every one of us. And that contrast is made all the more stark when the courts are compared to the communities directly impacted by their decisions. The majority of federaI judges are White and male. They\u2019re making decisions for communities they have often never been a part of \u2013 and that can have huge and irreparable implications, particularly for women and people of color. We are in a pivotal moment. This session, the Supreme Court is hearing cases on affirmative action, voting rights and LGBTQ+ discrimination. We need a diverse judiciary \u2013 across all levels of the federal government \u2013 that gives the public confidence that the judges who hold our fates in their hands are seeking to fully understand the parties before them and are intent on reaching more fair-minded and informed decisions. President Joe Biden feels this urgency and remains committed to judicial diversity. His appointment of Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the first Black woman on the Supreme Court, was a monumental milestone. And, as reported this July, 68% of Biden\u2019s judicial nominees confirmed by the Senate are Black, Hispanic or Asian American. This fall, we\u2019re calling on the Senate to confirm all of Biden\u2019s nominees \u2013 not just for the sake of the courts, but for the urgent and long overdue sake of restoring the public\u2019s trust. Fatima Goss Graves is the president and CEO of the National Women\u2019s Law Center. Despite polling that indicates Americans think democracy is on the brink of collapse, we all have a choice. We can either cower before the challenge, or we can act to support, defend and strengthen our experiment in democracy. After spending two decades serving as a US Marine, I\u2019ve chosen the latter approach. I now belong to We the Veterans, a nonpartisan pro-democracy group committed to building a more perfect union. We believe that positive civic engagement is an antidote to political tribalism and extremism \u2013 and that veterans can be a part of the solution. More specifically, veterans can fill the poll worker deficit currently facing our country. Democracy runs on elections, and elections run on volunteers. If a community does not recruit enough volunteers, it will have fewer polling stations, longer lines and potentially disenfranchised voters. The pandemic and threats of political violence have severely diminished volunteerism within the traditional cohort of election poll workers, many of whom are 61 years of age and older. According to one estimate, the US requires more than 1.1 million volunteer poll workers to administer elections, and experts now project a shortage of about 130,000 going into November. To meet this challenge, We the Veterans has launched its first nationwide public awareness campaign called Vet the Vote to recruit 100,000 veterans and family members to become poll workers in their communities. To date, we have recruited more than 60,000 poll workers. The military \u2013 including its veterans \u2013 is one of the most trusted institutions in our society, and it is our hope that when Americans see their veterans conspicuously serving in their polling stations, it will increase their faith in their electoral system and its outcomes. Additionally, veterans are trained to deescalate moments of tension and may be best suited to address any potential threats at the polls.

Plenzler is also on the board of We the Veterans and co-creator of Vet the Vote, a nationwide campaign to recruit 100,000 veterans and their family members to be poll workers. If you lower a pinata packed with treats into a chaotic children\u2019s birthday party, not only will you see some of the most astonishingly rapacious behavior imaginable, someone will almost certainly end up bleeding. Every election, we essentially simulate those conditions in our democracy. To retain whatever faith Americans have in our system of governance, we must arrest and reverse the dangerous tendency to turn everything into fodder for national political point-scoring. That means we must deregulate and devolve power to allow individuals to make their own choices about their love lives, their children\u2019s education, the substances they put in their bodies, how they run their businesses \u2013 and many other topics about which Americans have widely varying and deeply held opinions. As politics seeps into every single part of life, the stakes of our elections become untenably high. We must unstuff the pinata by reducing the size and scope of the government. That means eliminating giveaways to corporations and other favored groups, as well as strengthening protections for economic and civil liberties in order to dramatically expand the sphere of privacy. With less power over others at stake, the temptation to cheat (or accuse the other side of cheating) is reduced. This task isn\u2019t easy, but it makes all subsequent policymaking much easier. I disagree with 69% of both Republicans and Democrats \u2013 nothing unusual there since I am a libertarian \u2013 and don\u2019t think our democracy is on the brink of collapse. But I do think we are asking too much of our politicians and our political system, and that we shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they act like spoiled children. Katherine Mangu-Ward is editor in chief of Reason magazine and co-host of The Reason Roundtable podcast. Today, our congressional (and state) representatives are nominated in low-turnout party primaries, in which the most highly motivated, partisan voters predominate. Increasingly, the nominees that emerge from that process \u2013 particularly in Republican primaries \u2013 are the most uncompromising. Then, in November, elections are a \u201cfirst past the post\u201d contest only between the Republican and Democratic nominees, because a vote for a third-party or independent candidate is seen as wasted. This system stifles political choice and innovation \u2013 and leaves voters unsatisfied. There is an alternative: ranked choice voting (RCV) with open primaries. Step one is a non-partisan \u201cblanket\u201d primary that advances the top four or five finishers to the November election. Pragmatic representatives couldn\u2019t be knocked out at this stage because they would win enough votes from party moderates and independent voters to finish among the top four or five. In the general election, RCV also would be used to choose the winner. Voters would rank their choices among the final five, and the winning candidate would need an absolute majority of votes. If no candidate won a majority of first-preference votes, the weakest finisher would be eliminated \u2013 and their preferences would be transferred to their second choices. This would continue until a candidate won a majority. In this way, voters would be freed to vote for moderates and independents without fearing that they would be electing the candidate they most dislike. And pragmatism and flexibility would be encouraged because the process would tend to choose the most broadly appealing candidate. Some states are already moving in this direction. As a result of a 2020 voter initiative, Alaska is using the \u201ctop four\u201d RCV system this year for its executive, legislative and US House and Senate elections, and Nevada is voting this November on an initiative to adopt \u201ctop five\u201d RCV voting for its future elections.

The ability to vote is the most crucial component of a functioning democracy. Yet voting rights are under constant attack \u2013 more than 440 restrictive bills were introduced during the 2021 legislative session alone \u2013 and the integrity of election results are being called into question by some of the very people we elected into public office. In order to ensure that US democracy doesn\u2019t just survive, but thrives, we need first to rebuild trust in the electoral process itself to increase voter turnout. We can easily remove many of the existing barriers which have been built to impede one\u2019s ability to vote by implementing modern, proven, common sense solutions. For example, Arizona first pioneered online voter registration in 2002. Yet 20 years later, states such as Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas still refuse to offer this service. Online registration not only increases voter participation among under-represented minority communities but also lowers administrative costs for state and local governments. Enforcing arbitrary registration deadlines weeks before an election only serves to compound the voter registration problem. These deadlines could be eliminated entirely if all states adopted same-day registration (or Election Day registration). Especially in states with strict voter ID requirements, such as Indiana, it\u2019s a straightforward process to implement \u2013 and one which could enfranchise exponentially more voters than are disenfranchised by these ID laws. It\u2019s also been shown to radically increase voter turnout and overall confidence in election results. These simple and practical solutions must be made available to all eligible voters nationwide \u2013 both to increase voter participation and to rebuild their trust in our democracy. Debra Cleaver is the founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonprofit which builds technology to simplify political engagement, increase voter turnout and strengthen American democracy. As told to CNN Opinion Like many historians, I am an optimist. And American history provides a good baseline to assess the country\u2019s potential. Given that the US has weathered three great crises \u2013 the Civil War, the Great Depression and World War II \u2013 there is reason to believe America can survive its latest crisis. But this crisis \u2013 a loss of faith in American democracy \u2013 reflects a deep-seated anxiety about the very institutions this nation was founded on. In recent years, elements of democracy we took for granted, such as free and fair elections and the peaceful transfer of power, have been called into question. That said, this isn\u2019t the Weimar Republic in 1929, and there is still hope for American democracy. It begins by acknowledging that freedom has a cost, and it requires constant vigilance. In an era in which we are distracted by transactional opportunities \u2013 and not transformative ones \u2013 we lose sight of that fact. We must ask ourselves where we wish to live. Think of the film \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life.\u201d The larger question of that film is whether we want to live in Bedford Falls, a largely welcoming and friendly town, or Potterville, a dark and hateful place. Most Americans would likely choose the former. The only way we get to Bedford Falls is not through argument, but through story, conversation and connection. The novelist Richard Powers says, \u201cThe best arguments in the world won\u2019t change a person\u2019s mind. The only thing that can do that is a good story.\u201d I\u2019m in the business of trying to tell good stories. And my hope is that with each film I make, I move viewers. While I cannot control how they interpret the film, if I succeed, and the story lands some place inside of them, there is the potential for transformation. Though every story is different, the one commonality among them is really American resilience \u2013 how in the face of adversity, much internally-borne, America managed to survive and thrive. And it certainly can again. To paraphrase historian Deborah Lipstadt who appears in my latest project, \u201cThe U.S. and the Holocaust,\u201d the time to save a democracy is before it is lost \u2013 and that requires people paying attention, filtering sources of news and beginning a politics of compromise built on conversation and storytelling now. Ken Burns is an award-winning documentary filmmaker who has been making films for PBS for more than 40 years. He recently released \u201cThe U.S. and the Holocaust,\u201d a three-part, six hour series that examines America\u2019s response to the Holocaust. Liza Donnelly is a cartoonist and writer for The New Yorker and many other publications.  Her history, \u201cVery Funny Ladies: The New Yorker\u2019s Women Cartoonists,\u201d was published in 2022. To break the deadly cycle of hyper-partisan polarization that threatens American democracy, we should have a system that creates and supports more viable political parties, simply by allowing parties to cross-endorse candidates. Notice that I didn\u2019t say that we need a new party. In the current system of winner-take-all elections and single-member congressional districts, just creating a party isn\u2019t enough. A third party\u2019s candidates will often be spoilers, in many cases benefiting the party its voters like least. Instead, we need a system that encourages the formation of one, three or many new and lasting parties that can better represent the complex views of all voters at the local, state and national levels. With more than two political parties, some might represent factions of existing parties, such as non-MAGA Republicans or political moderates, while others might try to put particular issues on the agenda, such as universal basic income or marijuana legalization. They would bargain and form coalitions where they agreed \u2013 and differ where they didn\u2019t \u2013 creating some of the dynamics of a parliamentary democracy. There\u2019s just one modest step that could help us move toward that ideal of multi-party democracy: States should allow parties to nominate anyone who is eligible for the office, even if they have already been nominated by another party. This practice, known as \u201celectoral fusion,\u201d would let new parties emerge that might sometimes cross-endorse candidates from one of the major parties, if they agreed with them, sometimes run their own candidates or sometimes stay out of a race altogether. They wouldn\u2019t be spoilers unless they chose to be. Using fusion, new parties could influence the two major parties, even if they weren\u2019t yet big enough to win elections on their own. In states with a tradition of fusion, such as New York and Connecticut, the Working Families Party exercises such a role \u2013 and other parties have done so in the recent past. All but eight states enacted laws to prohibit parties from cross-endorsing candidates \u2013 mostly around the turn of the 20th century. Letting parties nominate whomever they want, including a candidate from another party, is just a partial step toward the fluid multi-party democracy we\u2019ve had in the past. But it would restore some of the bargaining and compromise that we\u2019ve been missing for the last several decades. Mark Schmitt is the director of the Political Reform Program at New America, a nonpartisan policy research organization. Threats to democracy are often examined through a national lens. However, a state approach can help strengthen democracy. For the past 50 years, pursuant to Florida\u2019s state constitution, citizens have had a right to propose constitutional amendments for all Floridians to vote on. This process is called the \u201ccitizens\u2019 initiative\u201d process. Through this process, Floridians have proposed whether to expand enfranchisement by restoring voting rights to persons who complete felony sentences, protect natural resources and ensure fairness in our political districts. These amendments, which all passed, have helped improve the lives of everyday Floridians and protect core facets of our democracy. Unfortunately, our state legislature continues to attempt to chip away at our precious citizens\u2019 initiative process by proposing legislation that ultimately seeks an all-out elimination of our ability to propose meaningful constitutional amendments or willfully ignores laws already adopted by voters. An instance of this can be easily exemplified. In 2010, more than 60% of Floridians voted for a pair of \u201cfair districts\u201d amendments. These amendments require our legislature to draw nonpartisan redistricting lines and protect minority voting power by prohibiting the diminishment of voting strength for racial or language minorities. In 2012, the state legislature blatantly ignored these requirements and passed partisan, gerrymandered maps. After the League of Women Voters of Florida and others sued and won, the Florida Supreme Court upheld these amendments in 2015 and fair maps were enacted. In 2022, the Florida legislature has again gutted the same fair districts amendments. Legislators have enacted a map drawn by our governor that cuts minority voting power in half and gives a stark advantage to one political party. The League and others have sued the legislature once more for violating the will of the people. This case is ongoing. It is time Florida\u2019s legislators stop ignoring successful citizens\u2019 initiatives and stop attempting to pass laws that further limit the process. Other states without any sort of similar process should consider creating their own to allow the direct voices of the people to be heard. Cecile M. Scoon, a lawyer, is the president of the League of Women Voters of Florida. There is no silver bullet for the problems confronting our democracy, but it is crucial to begin by recognizing that the political arena is intended to be a venue for disagreement and contention. Our political system now feels dysfunctional \u2013 not because we have forgotten how to agree with each other but because we have forgotten how to disagree constructively. Our two major parties spend too much time talking about each other and not enough time talking to each other. At the national level, only Congress can change this. Congress is designed as an arena for productive disagreement, where members who represent the diversity of the American polity can make accommodations and come to agreements on behalf of their disparate constituents. When it works properly, Congress builds common ground in American life. It would be an understatement to say that Congress does not do this today. And it is hard to see any way we could improve the health of our democracy without helping Congress function better. That could mean creating incentives for people more inclined toward legislative bargaining to run for Congress \u2013 for instance by experimenting with electoral reforms like ranked-choice voting. And it could mean reforming the work of the institution to make traditional legislative negotiation more appealing to the ambitious men and women who run for Congress \u2013 for instance by re-empowering the committees. More specifically, committees in both chambers could be given some direct control of floor time, as happens in some state legislatures, so that the work the committees do wouldn\u2019t feel like a dead end. Or Congress could eliminate the boundary between authorizing bills (which create programs) and appropriating bills (which spend money) so that all members, and not just the few who are appropriators, could be involved in meaningful legislating with real-world consequences. There is no shortage of ideas about how to move power from party leaders to rank-and-file legislators, but there has long been a shortage of will. Yes, electoral and congressional reform isn\u2019t exciting work, but it\u2019s essential for the future of our democracy. And we should want our politics to be a little less exciting anyway. Yuval Levin is the director of Social, Cultural, and Constitutional Studies at the American Enterprise Institute, where he also holds the Beth and Ravenel Curry Chair in Public Policy. When the Soviet Union collapsed some 30 years ago, people in Slovakia \u2013 my home country \u2013 looked to the American model of democracy as they built a new country founded on the principles of rule of law, human rights and civil liberties. The United States even aided those efforts, providing grants, training and exchange programs to guide our democratic efforts. Of course, Slovakia is far from perfect. It has made mistakes along the way \u2013 including in its use of police violence against the Roma minority, which a 2014 State Department report said was a hindrance to its democratic development. But the US has also lost the high ground on this issue, particularly in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death and other incidents of violence by the police against American minority populations. Simply put, how can we, Slovaks, accept advice or criticism from Americans, when they seem to be struggling with the same problems \u2013 and yet have a democracy that is over 200 years older than ours? If the US wants to regain trust abroad \u2013 and to continue to inspire young democracies to believe in its form of governance \u2013 it needs to lead by example. In the case of police violence, there may not be a simple solution, but the US can put forward solutions. President Joe Biden has taken positive first steps by signing an executive order advancing accountability in the police force and criminal justice system. Congress should follow with a more comprehensive bill that includes specific training, instruction and incentives for law enforcement facing this issue. Americans may not realize how much those of us beyond their borders look to the US to lead the democratic world. But it\u2019s a truth worth reminding my American friends. Your country can be imperfect, but it should be at the forefront of putting forward ideas that address those imperfections \u2013 and guiding young countries like mine toward becoming more inclusive nations.

He is the author and editor of 24 books, including, \u201cThe Presidency of Donald J. Trump: A First Historical Assessment.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Democrats have to be feeling good about recent polls. It appears that former President Donald Trump and the Supreme Court have given Democrats a chance to blunt, if not reverse, the historic midterm trend that leaves the president\u2019s party nursing significant losses. If the polls are to be believed, Democrats might just hold on to their majorities in the House and Senate, making 2022 a rare example of the party in power doing well. Opinion: The albatross around Democrats' necks The most recent data from a New York Times/Siena College poll found that Democrats are in a competitive position, with 46% of registered voters saying they back the party\u2019s candidate for Congress in their district, compared to 44% for Republicans. This is a dramatic turnaround, given that analysts had anticipated a \u201cred wave\u201d at the beginning of the year. While President Joe Biden\u2019s legislative success (most notably, the Inflation Reduction Act) has been important, the easing of gas prices, the scandals surrounding Trump and the fury over the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has put the GOP on the defense. For Dems, highlighting a radicalized Republican Party with a leader who is in serious legal and political trouble will be a key element of any success they achieve. This shouldn\u2019t be particularly difficult, given that Trump has endorsed numerous election-denying candidates and made headlines in response to the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into his handling of government records. But being the anti-Trump party won\u2019t be enough. If Biden wants to shape the political narrative in congressional Democrats\u2019 favor, he will have to do more to tell the country the story of his administration. Telling the story of a presidency is part of what leaders do. When there is immense legislative output, as we have now seen during the Biden administration, presidents have worked hard to connect the dots for voters in order to drive home how new laws will make a positive difference in their lives. This can also be a branding exercise, as shown by President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cNew Deal.\u201d When FDR accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in 1932, he promised a \u201cnew deal for the American people.\u201d The phrase remained a powerful framework though which voters could understand what he was trying to do as he vastly expanded the reach of government in American life. Not only did each new program aim to ameliorate the devastating effects of the Great Depression, but the administration also sought to create a new level of security and support \u2013 through unemployment compensation, agricultural support, social security, unions and more \u2013 for working Americans. Opinion: Adam Kinzinger's big regret In the 1960s, President Lyndon Johnson was looking for a way to explain his goals for the country. As he embarked on one of the most ambitious expansions of government since the New Deal, Johnson understood that the language he used would be important. He enlisted the help of Princeton history professor Eric Goldman and speechwriter Richard Goodwin, who helped him conceive of and coin the phrase \u201cGreat Society.\u201d Through a \u201cGreat Society,\u201d Johnson offered a vision of how the federal government could help every individual become more self-sufficient and independent, ultimately obtaining the tools that were needed to prosper in the growing economy. As LBJ said at the University of Michigan in 1964, the Great Society \u201crests on abundance and liberty for all. It demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time. But this is just the beginning. The Great Society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talent. It is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness \u2026 The Great Society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work. It is a challenge constantly renewed.\u201d In other words, his policies would help an already prosperous nation do better and to bring everyone into the fold. Other presidents have relied on slogans to convey their stories. President Harry Truman had his \u201cFair Deal\u201d and, of course, Trump sold his agenda around \u201cMaking America Great Again.\u201d Legislative leaders have used this too, such as when Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republicans won control of Congress in 1994 by promising a \u201cContract with America.\u201d These slogans give Americans a concise way to understand what these politicians stand for \u2013 and their repeatability helps amplify any political victories won. What\u2019s Biden\u2019s vision? Despite his legislative breakthroughs on Covid-19, infrastructure, health care, climate change and more, the answer to this question remains unclear. He has tried on different approaches and appeals with varying success, whether it be building back better or defending democracy at home and abroad.  What\u2019s clear is that the President has been committed to what might be called a public investment society. He sees that the federal government has a huge role to play in devoting resources to areas of the economy and parts of society that need more support. The goal is to help the middle class grow, ensure the future of our planet and preserve our democratic process. Telling this story and offering Americans a simple way to understand what he is doing and what his party aspires to do after the midterms would be enormously helpful as Democrats hit the campaign trail in coming weeks. Encapsulating his vision in clear and concise terms could make the difference for Biden and the Democrats in what promises to be a tight midterm election. Warning about the dangers of a radicalized Republican Party is a powerful message, but so too is offering a path forward for a better America.",

Growing up in Brooklyn and Queens in the 1980s, I was saved by the study of Black history. It helped me to make sense of the police shootings of Black people, the segregated schools I attended and the all-Black neighborhoods that I lived in. Beginning in childhood, my mother became my history teacher and intellectual raconteur. The lessons that I learned growing up about the power of storytelling to change politics, legislation and the ways entire communities related to each other, reverberate now more than ever. I cling to those memories now, amid our current moment of partisan division, rancorous debates over the teaching of American history, controversies over voting rights and confrontations over the meaning of the events of January 6, 2021. I know that the stories we tell each other about the nation we live in have taken on a new sense of urgency. Personally, I have been invigorated by efforts \u2013 as a scholar, an active citizen and a husband and father \u2013 to tell a more complicated, uncomfortable, but ultimately more satisfying narrative about America\u2019s past, present and future, and my (and our) place in it. America\u2019s present has the power to transform its history, and vice versa. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming, but tonight because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment change has come to America,\u201d then-President-elect Barack Obama observed to the cheering throng in Grant Park in Chicago. Obama\u2019s historic election night in November 2008, like the Thirteenth Amendment\u2019s passage and ratification in 1865 and the Supreme Court\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education decision ordering desegregation in 1954, opened up a new political world. All three moments introduced new possibilities for how Americans defined citizenship. The image of Obama standing on stage as president-elect of the United States of America breathed new and animating life into the Thirteenth and Brown \u2013 transforming Americans\u2019 understanding of their own history. For some, this was a revelation. For others, it constituted an existential threat. Why I'm not giving up on the embattled dream of America To appreciate why, it\u2019s important to discern that most Americans\u2019 understanding of their history since the end of the Civil War has been split between a \u201creconstructionist\u201d perspective \u2013 adopted by supporters of multiracial democracy \u2013 and a \u201credemptionist\u201d point of view \u2013 offered initially by former Confederates and later by advocates of White supremacy. The stakes of the battle between them have long been the nation\u2019s very soul. Understanding the American story requires learning about the nation\u2019s history through a set of new eyes that allows us the vision to see both the grandeur and travails of our ongoing democratic experiment. In so doing we get to witness the historical parallels and political juxtapositions that show us that history, while never exactly repeating itself, most definitely rhymes. These contrasting approaches have shaped more than our history; they have also influenced (and still play a role) in how Americans have defined citizenship, national identity and democracy since 1865. Jim Crow America was largely ruled by a redemptionist hand. At the turn of the 20th century, for instance, redemptionist politics were mainstream enough for a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan to take place (it was revived in 1915 in Stone Mountain, Georgia, where a monument to White supremacy remains today). \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d D. W. Griffith\u2019s silent film portraying Reconstruction as a horrible mistake, was released in February of that year and became a sensation (it was screened for an approving President Woodrow Wilson at the White House). Mass violence was perpetrated in multiple American cities in the years following, including a massacre in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in 1921 in which White people murdered over 300 Black people and razed a prosperous, all-Black neighborhood (Greenwood) to the ground. America's monument to White victimhood Struggles for Black dignity that reached a low point in Tulsa\u2019s aftermath, took on new and vital dimensions after the Second World War. During the Second Reconstruction, which unfolded from the Supreme Court\u2019s 1954 Brown decision until the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, reconstructionists won important legislative victories in bills declaring formal segregation unconstitutional. None were more significant than the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. America\u2019s Second Reconstruction transformed the social compact for Black folk, and the legacies from this period still reverberate nationally. We are still engaged in debates over voting rights, citizenship and dignity that roiled the nation during the 1950s and 1960s. The Second Reconstruction institutionalized support and unprecedented consensus around the value of Black equality to the strength of democracy, as a political and moral good. Pastor: 'There are Tulsas across this country' Though Brown, in 1954, marks the beginning of the Second Reconstruction, the origin date for the emergence of a national consensus on racial justice could be traced to June 11, 1963, when President Kennedy delivered a televised address on the issue. That evening Kennedy spoke more candidly about racial inequality than ever before, noting that Blacks were \u201cnot yet freed from social and economic injustice\u201d and that this fact negatively impacted the entire country. America, Kennedy observed, \u201cfor all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free.\u201d Although there were setbacks, false starts, outright lies and performative gestures in the years that followed, and the achievements fell far short of the ambitious goals of reconstructionists, rhetorical support for racial justice proved much better for the nation\u2019s democratic health than its opposite. In retrospect, America enjoyed a 50-year period of affirmation of racial justice between JFK\u2019s finest moment as president and the June 25, 2013, \u201cShelby v. Holder\u201d Supreme Court decision, which gutted the Voting Rights Act. What the broader consensus had helped to mask was the continuing division over the federal government\u2019s role in guaranteeing Black citizenship and dignity. Reconstructionist thought situates America as a multiracial democracy, one free, in word and deed, of the ancient bonds of discrimination and racial injustice. In the wake of the Second Reconstruction, redemptionists pledged support for racial justice, too, but not for federal intervention, which they interpreted as a violation of constitutional principles and the sanctity of states\u2019 rights and individual preference. From the Shelby decision in 2013 to current midterm debates over how to address race and gender in the classroom, the nation is missing the racial justice consensus that fostered the rough compromises that allowed for racial progress to move at such a pace to lead to the election of a Black president. What one man's life and death can teach us about the fight for the Black vote Many politicians who adhered to redemptionist thinking apparently failed over more recent decades to spot the paradox between claiming proof that America was no longer a racist nation and supporting policies, from the blocking of anti-discrimination measures to the passage of laws that stymied voting rights and fueled mass incarceration, that resulted in the amplification of Black misery, suffering and premature death even if these outcomes were not always the intent. Among the effects were ongoing residential and public-school segregation, high rates of unemployment, imprisonment and housing discrimination, which largely shut Black families out of the wealth created through home ownership. As the nation moved into the Third Reconstruction that started with Obama\u2019s election and continued through the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol building in 2021 and the investigative hearings that dominated the news this year, the racial cold war produced striking juxtapositions between racial progress and setbacks. For as long as I can remember, I have been a student of American history. Its grace and its horrors helped me make sense of my own familial history, as the proud son of Haitian immigrants who moved to New York City in the mid-1960s.  \u201cEyes on the Prize,\u201d the monumental documentary series first broadcast on television in 1987, during my freshman year in high school, brought the history of the civil rights movement to life in my household over six glorious hours. The series treated Black people with deep empathy; suggesting their stories were worthy of respect. And then in the summer before turning 17, I saw Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d which premiered on July 21, 1989. The film, set in the Bedford Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn, documented the anatomy of a race riot triggered by police violence. 'Do The Right Thing' still has something to say The film\u2019s portrayal of the afterlife of the civil rights movement \u2013 a city still scarred by segregation, poverty and racial discrimination \u2013 mirrored my own experiences. The police killing of a young Black man named Radio Raheem, who spends most of the film blaring Public Enemy\u2019s \u201cFight the Power!\u201d from a boom box, made the film a touchstone for me and an entire generation of young African Americans. The movie\u2019s coda, which drew quotes about Black dignity from Malcolm X and Black citizenship from Martin Luther King Jr., stayed with me and inspired me to turn my love of history into a lifelong vocation. I discovered new worlds in history books, echoes of earlier freedom struggles \u2013 some victorious and others short-lived \u2013 that nonetheless served as inspiration for me to find out where I fit into a narrative that seemed larger than the one offered during the course of my secondary education. In college I majored in history and Black Studies and stumbled into an interest in Reconstruction that only grew after I went to graduate school. But even completing a doctorate in American history on the civil rights era, a time period I came to later view as America\u2019s Second Reconstruction, left me unsatisfied with the stories we tell about the nation\u2019s past. We can finally meet the real Malcolm X Dissatisfaction grew into determination, and I found myself using the study of history as both an intellectual shield and political sword capable of explaining the links between contemporary instances of structural racism and backlash and long forgotten episodes of inequality that served as the origin story for our latest political woes. But it was not until 2020\u2019s political and racial reckoning, when I watched millions of people around the world look to history to heal a troubled global soul, that I realized that there were so many people in search of a story that could help them make sense of things. The more I tried myself to make sense of the murder of George Floyd, the rise of then-President Donald Trump and his MAGA supporters and the grace and dignity of the Black women who led the Black Lives Matter movement, the more I turned to history.  I believe that the more we learn about these three periods of Reconstruction the better off we will all be. Understanding the origins of our current discontents allows us the collective power to choose a different path. This requires that we confront the dark parts of American history while holding on to the freedom dreams of Black, White, Latinx, Asian American and Pacific Islander, Indigenous, queer, disabled, working class and immigrant communities that have transformed this nation for the better. Our first two reconstruction periods ended prematurely, wrecked by political violence, partisan divisions and a failure to craft a new narrative of American history courageously inclusive enough to deal with the bitter and beautiful parts of our history. This latest reconstruction period offers the profound opportunity to begin to shape a new more compassionate, ethical and morally redemptive story of America. That new story, beyond the history books, national commemorations and evolving political culture, starts with each of us. All we have to do is choose.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion on CNN. On Tuesday, voters in Kansas cast their ballots and rejected a measure that would have allowed restrictive abortion laws to go forward in the state. It\u2019s a huge victory for abortion rights: Kansas is the first state to vote on abortion since the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs v Jackson Women\u2019s Health decision earlier this summer that overturned Roe v. Wade, and ended nearly 50 years of a constitutional right to abortion. The result in Kansas confirms that Americans simply do not want an extreme anti-abortion movement regulating women\u2019s bodies. Kansans have said what most Americans believe: abortion is an issue best left to women and their doctors. The vote was much watched by abortion rights proponents and opponents alike. It also wasn\u2019t exactly a fair fight: One conservative group sent out text messages on Monday, the day of the vote, warning, \u201cWomen in KS are losing their choice on reproductive rights. Voting YES on the Amendment will give women a choice. Vote YES to protect women\u2019s health.\u201d Voting \u201cyes\u201d on the Amendment was actually a vote against abortion rights. Abortion opponents, though, were clearly worried enough that Kansas voters cared about women\u2019s rights, and so they resorted to playing dirty. They still lost, which makes this victory even sweeter. Still, this win is a complicated one. It\u2019s tempting to look at the outcome of this election and draw sweeping conclusions about America\u2019s appetite for \u2013 or rejection of \u2013 abortion restrictions. The truth is, Americans overwhelmingly did not want to see Roe v. Wade overturned and are generally pro-choice, but when you drill down, people have all kinds of opinions on how, whether and when abortion should be regulated \u2013 whether it should be legal in cases of rape or incest; whether it should be legal if a woman is too poor to support a child; whether it should be legal after the first trimester. These are all the wrong questions. Fundamental rights \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t get more fundamental than sovereignty over one\u2019s own body \u2013 should not be up for a vote, even if the righteous side is likely to win. This is a foundational principle in the United States: That while voters should be able to pick their president and their representatives in Congress and at the state level, and have the power to vote on various state-level laws, our Constitution protects the rights of minority and other historically mistreated groups as well. No one should see their basic rights subject to the tyranny of the majority. And yet that is the position that women and others who can get pregnant are now in. It\u2019s the position that LGBTQ folks are in as well, as they watch their rights head toward the conservative chopping block:  A majority of Republicans in the House voted against a bill that protects same-sex and interracial marriage rights. The legislation was passed as a response to fears that the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could take aim at same-sex marriage in the future \u2013 47 Republicans voted with the Democrats in favor of the bill, while more than 150 voted against. Its fate in the Senate depends on whether 10 Republicans will join with the Democratic majority to support it there. Thunderclap ballot box victory on abortion rights in Kansas gives Democrats a potent midterm issue The right to marry who you love, the right to decide whether and when to have children \u2013 there are few decisions more fundamental to one\u2019s life than these. Even though same-sex marriage and abortion rights are broadly supported by the American public, it simply should not be up to that public to decide which groups are granted legal protections and the basic dignity of fair and equal treatment. In 1965, the country was split on the question of whether interracial marriage should be outlawed, and like with abortion and same-sex marriage, there was a significant regional divide: nearly three-quarters of Southern whites supported anti-miscegenation laws, while a minority of non-Southern whites said the same. That same year, a majority of Southern whites also said that President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s administration was moving too fast on racial integration. In response first to the push to end slavery and then to end racial segregation, these same Southern whites and their political representatives took up the mantle of \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d \u2013 the ability of individual states to make their own laws, which would in turn let them enslave other human beings, or treat Black people as second-class citizens. Then, as now, questions of fundamental rights and human dignity should not have been left up to the whims of voters or even state legislators. The Supreme Court said as much in its decisions ending racial segregation, anti-miscegenation laws, bans on abortion and contraception and laws restricting same-sex marriage. Unfortunately, with its more recent decision in Dobbs, the Court didn\u2019t just end the right to abortion \u2013 it ended the era of protecting fundamental rights, no matter which way the political winds were blowing. The same states\u2019 rights ideology that conservatives have long used to justify slavery and segregation now shapes women\u2019s rights in the United States. Whether you are allowed to end a pregnancy or forced under threat of law to continue it against your will depends on where you live. The vote in Kansas reflects this same view: That the question of whether or not women have basic rights to our own internal organs \u2013 whether, as Irish writer Sally Rooney eloquently put it, women get to decide what happens to our own bodies or whether we are \u201cgranted fewer rights than a corpse\u201d \u2013 should hinge on whether you can convince a majority of people in your state to agree.  Democracy is a powerful tool, and frankly the US should have a lot more of it. But democracy without proper safeguards for minority groups and those long mistreated can be profoundly unjust. That\u2019s where American women are today. The Kansas vote is a tremendous relief, and it should curb an overly-aggressive anti-abortion movement. But the fact that a vote happened at all is a sign of our misogynist decline.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Kara Alaimo, an associate professor in the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University, writes about issues affecting women and social media. She was spokeswoman for international affairs in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion at CNN. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democrat, is campaigning against Republican TV personality Dr. Mehmet Oz in one of the highest-stakes elections in the upcoming midterms. Fetterman\u2019s congressional campaign gives the Democrats a chance to pick up a seat in the US Senate, where they currently have a paper-thin majority \u2013 and the reason he just might do it could come down to his cheeky social media strategy. Fetterman\u2019s Twitter account combines policy stances with dashes of his \u201ceveryman\u201d personality \u2013 all while humorously trolling his opponent. By repeatedly chipping away at Oz\u2019s legitimacy as a Pennsylvania resident, Fetterman has successfully shaped and controlled the narrative, even when he\u2019s been off the campaign trail for two months due to a life-threatening stroke. It\u2019s an inspired approach, and I really hope other Democrats are taking notes. Let\u2019s be clear: There\u2019s plenty for Fetterman to criticize about Oz, a physician and media personality who has long peddled dubious medical claims. In 2014, a study published in the British Medical Journal found that 54% of the recommendations Oz made on \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show\u201d were either inconclusive or lacking in supporting evidence. Oz, who has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, has also cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 election. \u201cI have discussed it with President Trump, and we cannot move on,\u201d he said in a primary debate. \u201cWe have to be serious about what happened in 2020.\u201d It\u2019s downright terrifying that someone with Oz\u2019s inability or unwillingness to rely on facts could be in a position to cast critical votes affecting people across the nation. But Fetterman\u2019s hardest-hitting social media attacks accuse Oz of something else altogether: being from New Jersey (Oz says he moved to Pennsylvania in 2020 after living in the Garden State for decades). Fetterman\u2019s campaign enlisted the help of Nicole Polizzi \u2013 the \u201cJersey Shore\u201d star known as \u201cSnooki\u201d \u2013 to create a video wishing Oz well on his move \u201cfrom New Jersey to Pennsylvania to look for a new job.\u201d  Fetterman also started a petition to induct Dr. Oz into the New Jersey Hall of Fame, and released a campaign video on Twitter featuring clips of Dr. Oz talking about his New Jersey roots. Opinion: Trump's ego and greed help divide a sport When Oz ate at Pat\u2019s and Geno\u2019s, Philadelphia\u2019s two most famous cheesesteak joints, Fetterman tweeted that doing so is \u201ca rite of passage for every tourist.\u201d (His comment was spot on. As Matthew Cantor wrote in The Guardian, \u201cAny local can list at least five cheesesteak places they\u2019ve deemed better than those two.\u201d)  And before the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, Fetterman tweeted that the players \u201cmight have a *famous* fan cheering them on from Cliffside Park, NJ.\u201d The strategy is brilliant for several reasons. First, the ribs are memorable. The creative approach shows an understanding of how to cut through the firehose of information to go viral, reaching even voters who don\u2019t pay close attention to politics. By driving home the notion that Oz isn\u2019t really from their state \u2013 and by extension, wouldn\u2019t represent the people of Pennsylvania as well \u2013 Fetterman has made this a central issue that will likely stand out in voters\u2019 minds come Election Day. This also allows Fetterman \u2013 who has broken out of what we typically expect from politicians (see the trademark hoodie and shorts) \u2013 to present himself as a down-to-earth candidate who understands the needs of everyday Pennsylvanians. This is in sharp contrast to the image Fetterman paints of Oz as an out-of-touch celebrity who owns mansions. Never mind that Fetterman grew up in an affluent suburb and earned a graduate degree from Harvard. His ability to make references to the convenience store chain Sheetz or use \u201cyinz\u201d while calling for the federal minimum wage to be raised conveys the very authenticity he accuses his opponent of lacking. Opinion: Biden is on the verge of a huge political victory The element of jest is also savvy. His tweets suggest that Oz (who has peddled misinformation and made some questionable attacks) simply isn\u2019t someone who Fetterman takes too seriously \u2013 and the implicit message is that neither should the rest of us. That\u2019s a devastating blow to Oz. But because it\u2019s being conveyed with humor, Fetterman doesn\u2019t come off poorly for going on the attack. What\u2019s just as relevant as the strategy Fetterman has taken is the one he\u2019s chosen not to deploy. Oz\u2019s parents were born in Turkey and Oz identifies as Muslim, but Fetterman isn\u2019t suggesting Oz isn\u2019t American \u2013 a tactic Trump, who has an ugly record of attacking people from different racial, ethnic and religious groups, famously deployed against former President Barack Obama. The contrast with the behavior of Trump \u2013 who is aligned with Oz \u2013 sends a powerful message about Fetterman\u2019s values. Instead, Fetterman has been emphasizing kitchen table issues while giving people something to laugh about. Oz, on the other hand, has been deploying tired Republican tactics of fear, amping up concerns about how Fetterman would handle crime and calling his policies \u201cradical\u201d and \u201csocialist.\u201d There\u2019s evidence Fetterman\u2019s approach may be working: the lieutenant governor, who has been sidelined for two months due to his health, has raised $11 million in the last three months, compared to Oz, who brought in nearly $4 million.  Fetterman\u2019s strategy is one that other Democrats \u2013 who badly need a unified message going into the midterms \u2013 should be learning from. Remember when Trump\u2019s tweets would lead the day\u2019s headlines? The Biden White House simply isn\u2019t shaping the narrative in the same way. It should try to control the national conversation by using Twitter in the way Trump did so successfully \u2013 but instead of the rancor, outrageousness and constant controversies, it should try injecting some of the personality, flair and creativity we\u2019ve seen from Fetterman\u2019s campaign. Fetterman has found a way to rib Oz while playing it cool. He lets voters know that they shouldn\u2019t take Oz too seriously \u2013 but instead of the mudslinging that turns people off from politics, he has some fun while still making his message clear. Here\u2019s hoping other Democrats take a page from his playbook.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In the 1850s, a barroom brawler named John Morrissey took on and defeated some of the leading boxers of the time. Nicknamed \u201cOld Smoke,\u201d the Irish immigrant who grew up in Troy, NY, would go on to mastermind a gambling empire, found the famed Saratoga horse racing track and win a seat in the US House of Representatives. But Morrissey is also known for popularizing one enduring phrase. Challenging a rival to fight him for stakes of $2,500, Morrissey said, \u201cNow, if he means business, let him put up, or shut up\u2026\u201d Those last five words were the same ones former White House counsel Pat Cipollone used when he described to House investigators his reaction to the 2020 election deniers in Trump\u2019s inner circle who floated increasingly desperate schemes to overturn the results. \u201cThere was a real question in my mind and a real concern, you know,\u201d Cipollone told the January 6 committee, \u201cparticularly after the Attorney General had reached a conclusion that there wasn\u2019t sufficient election fraud to change the outcome of the election when other people kept suggesting that there was. The answer is, what is it? And at some point you have to put up or shut up.\u201d Trump\u2019s extreme supporters showed \u201ca general disregard for the importance of actually backing up what you say with facts,\u201d said Cipollone. And seizing voting machines, as lawyer Sidney Powell and others suggested during a tumultuous six-hour meeting on December 18, 2020, was \u201ca terrible idea,\u201d he added. \u201cThat\u2019s not how we do things in the United States.\u201d Cipollone may have killed that bonkers idea, but it didn\u2019t deter Trump from tweeting, shortly after the White House meeting broke up, \u201cBig protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\u201d Trump and his backers never put up real evidence of fraud \u2013 but they also didn\u2019t shut up, and the 45th president harps on about it even now as he considers when to announce he will run for the presidency again in 2024. Will the House select committee\u2019s investigation block Trump\u2019s path back to the White House? Norman Eisen and Fred Wertheimer praised the committee for \u201ca blockbuster series of seven hearings \u2013 we would argue the most important ones we\u2019ve seen in a half century.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201cwill be wild\u201d tweet served as a \u201csiren setting us on the path to the conflagration that was January 6\u2026\u201d And now, the threat to democracy remains, according to Eisen and Wertheimer. \u201cThe mob dispersed on January 6 and Trump left the White House, but he and his enablers continue to push the outrageous lie that the 2020 election was stolen. There are over 100 Trump adherents running for federal and state office, over 200 pieces of legislation based on the election fraud lie, and the Supreme Court is set to take up a case that could allow state legislators to do the kinds of things that Trump and his allies sought. With all of this, we face not only a constitutional crisis, but also an existential one.\u201d As Michael D\u2019Antonio pointed out, \u201cAmong the startling bits of evidence the committee presented was a text message exchange between Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Brad Parscale and former Trump campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson after the riot. Parscale expressed that he was feeling \u2018guilty\u2019 for helping Trump become president because his rhetoric had inflamed the mob. \u201cPierson texted. \u2018You did what you felt right at the time and therefore it was right.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Yeah. But a woman is dead,\u2019 Parscale replied. \u201cPierson said Trump\u2019s rhetoric hadn\u2019t been the cause of the attack. Parscale answered, \u2018Katrina. Yes it was.\u2019\u201d D\u2019Antonio wrote, \u201cIf, come 2024, we find ourselves with a candidate Trump on the presidential ballot, this hearing provides a terrifying glimpse of what\u2019s at stake. It should serve as a huge wake up call to voters that they would be electing a man who will let nothing \u2013 not the truth or the safety of Americans \u2013 stand in the way of his omnipotent aspirations.\u201d For more: Norman Eisen and Dennis Aftergut: Steve Bannon\u2019s new ploy Democrats seemed determined last week to prove the truth of Leo Tolstoy\u2019s famous line: \u201cAll happy families are alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\u201d A New York Times/Siena College poll found that 64% of Democratic voters think the party should pick a 2024 candidate other than President Joe Biden. Nearly half of Republicans don\u2019t want Trump to run again either. And while only 13% of American voters think the country is headed on the right track, the poll shows, at this very early stage, that Biden could narrowly defeat Trump in a 2024 rematch. On Thursday, Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, made it known that he would block most of the remaining parts of Biden\u2019s Build Back Better agenda, to the fury of progressives seeking action on climate change and other priorities. Charlie Dent, a former Republican congressman, said Manchin\u2019s stance is understandable: Biden won in 2020 because of the \u201cexhaustion, disgust and contempt so many voters had\u201d for Trump. \u201cThe big mistake Biden and Democrats made was believing voters gave them control of Washington, DC, to force a progressive agenda through Congress. On the contrary, voters wanted stability, normalcy and moderation \u2013 a fact Manchin is quite willing to remind Biden and his congressional colleagues of.\u201d Even before Manchin\u2019s pronouncement, Reshma Saujani, founder of the nonprofit Girls Who Code, was deeply dissatisfied with the Democratic Party\u2019s approach. \u201cFor millions of Americans, myself included, the recent Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade was a tragedy. But while watching our rights to privacy, choice and bodily autonomy go up in flames was gutting to many of us, it wasn\u2019t surprising \u2013 and neither was Democrats\u2019 tepid response. \u201cIn a moment that demanded action, the Democrats gave us\u2026 messaging. Lots and lots of messaging. They flooded our inboxes with desperate pleas to donate, our nightly news with hollow soundbites and our Twitter feeds with warnings that low turnout in November would usher in a draconian future that, come to think of it, looks a whole lot like the present. \u201cIf the Democratic Party wants us to mobilize for them en masse \u2013 yet again \u2013 they need to prove that they\u2019ll actually do something with the power we give them.\u201d Longtime Democratic strategist Paul Begala wrote that he shares the progressives\u2019 frustration but believes internal party criticism is weakening the President at a critical time. \u201cThe reality is that Biden has, in fact, done a ton of good despite GOP obstructionism. \u2026 His policies \u2013 especially the child tax credit in his rescue package \u2013 reduced child poverty, keeping some six million kids from falling into poverty. \u201cMy message to my progressive friends is this: We\u2019re all in the same boat, so stop poking holes in the boat and then complaining that Biden is getting you wet,\u201d concluded Begala. \u201cMany young Americans who were keen to vote former President Donald Trump out of office are now profoundly unhappy with Biden as well,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer, citing the Times\u2019 poll. \u201cThey have experienced firsthand a growing climate crisis, racial injustice, the breakdown of democratic institutions and norms, gender inequity and widespread economic insecurity \u2013 issues that have been much discussed but rarely addressed. \u201cMany of these young people have also grown up participating in active shooter drills at school. Unlike the famous duck-and-cover drills of the 1950s meant to prepare kids for a nuclear war that never happened, this country has witnessed the persistent drumbeat of school shootings. Can we really blame young people for feeling disillusioned with the US political system that allows this to continue?\u201d Writing in his Substack newsletter, Ruy Teixeira pinpointed a \u201cyawning chasm\u201d in voter backing for Democrats, drawing upon on the Times\u2019 poll. \u201cThe lack of Democratic support among working class (noncollege) voters is striking. Democrats lose among all working class voters by 11 points, but carry the college-educated by 23 points\u2026 \u201cIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Democrats\u2019  emphasis on social and democracy issues, while catnip to some socially liberal, educated voters, leaves many working class and Hispanic voters cold. Their concerns are more mundane and economically-driven. This is despite the fact that many of these voters are in favor of moderate abortion rights and gun control and disapprove of the January 6th events. But these issues are just not salient for them in the way they are for the Democrats\u2019 educated and most fervent supporters.\u201d Sensing an opportunity as well as a need, Republicans are rallying behind a new version of Sen. Mitt Romney\u2019s proposed Family Security Act which would give working families a cash benefit of $250 to $350 per child per month, according to Oren Cass, executive director of the think tank American Compass. It would be partly funded by eliminating the tax deduction for state and local taxes, which Democrats from high-tax states would no doubt oppose. But if it gets off the ground, Cass wrote, \u201cIt could offer the best opportunity in a long time for a meaningful, durable, widely supported program to help working families with the costs of raising children. If America is going to have a robust family benefit, it will look something like this.\u201d Inflation remains a top worry, politically and economically, with June\u2019s index showing consumer prices in the US rising at the highest rate in more than 40 years. (That report covers last month and doesn\u2019t reflect the more recent drop in gasoline and oil prices.) As grocery shoppers know, food prices have spiked, partly because Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine is blocking grain and other exports. Tim Benton of Chatham House noted that Ukraine is the fifth largest exporter of wheat and the biggest exporter of sunflower oil. \u201cBy impeding the flow of grain from this breadbasket region, food becomes a powerful weapon in Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s arsenal. This is nothing new for warmongers. For centuries, siege tactics have been deployed to starve populations.\u201d \u201cWhat is new is that this tactic is not being deployed to subjugate the country under attack, but to hurt the world\u2019s most vulnerable to create political leverage for Russia,\u201d Benton wrote. \u201cExporting stolen grain as \u2018Russian\u2019 to Russia\u2019s allies adds further insult to injury.\u201d Beyond Ukraine though, there are larger questions about food prices. \u201cOver 70 years, we have collectively designed a food system to deliver an excess of calories as cheaply as possible, with little focus on nutrition. The result is ever cheaper and more processed food, through long and complex supply chains, with the health and environmental consequences it brings. \u201cAll that is happening now means the era of cheap food may be over.\u201d Former CNN Moscow bureau chief Jill Dougherty shed light on the fate of WNBA all-star Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia for five months. Griner faces a possible 10-year prison sentence on charges of drug smuggling after customs officials say they found vape cartridges containing hashish oil in her luggage. \u201cIn relations with Russia, as with Iran and North Korea, American citizens who are not spies have been arrested and held as political \u2018hostages,\u2019 bargaining chips to be exchanged for citizens those countries want back,\u201d Dougherty observed. \u201cWith her star quality, Griner would be a valuable asset if Putin did want a prisoner exchange, something Moscow has indicated might be a possibility. \u2026 Last week Griner pleaded guilty to the drug trafficking charge, telling the judge: \u2018But there was no intent. I didn\u2019t want to break the law.\u2019 That admission could help resolve the case, legal experts believe. \u201cBut this highly politicized trial is being decided in the glare of cameras and public outcry, amidst a crisis in diplomatic relations.\u201d Driving in a high occupancy vehicle lane meant for at least two people, Brandy Bottone told a police officer who pulled her over in Dallas that her unborn child, due early next month, should count as the second passenger. It didn\u2019t work. \u201cIt seems Texas\u2019s strict anti-abortion law, which defines an \u2018unborn child\u2019 as \u2018an individual living member of the homo sapiens species,\u2019 only applies when it can be used against women \u2013 not when it can help them get out of a traffic ticket,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cIt\u2019s understandable, given how disheartening the last weeks have been for those of us who believe women have a fundamental right to bodily autonomy, to want to cheer for the moments that clarify just how dystopian anti-abortion laws really are. But as satisfying as this gotcha moment might be, establishing a fertilized egg, embryo or fetus as a separate person imbued with the same rights as you or I is a step down a dangerous path. It is absurd to be sure. But it\u2019s also incredibly perilous for women\u2019s rights and for a reality-based society more broadly.\u201d Historian Mary Ziegler spotlighted the reaction to the Indianapolis Star\u2019s report of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who had been sexually assaulted \u2013 and was six weeks and three days pregnant. It was \u201cthree days past the cutoff in her state for legal abortion. The story went viral, with President Joe Biden asking Americans to \u2018imagine being that little girl.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd yet the response to the story, for many,\u201d Ziegler pointed out, \u201cwas scorn and disbelief. Republican US Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio blasted the story as \u2018another lie.\u2019 Ohio attorney general Dave Yost joined Fox News anchors in suggesting that the story had been made up. The Wall Street Journal described the report as \u2018too good to be true.\u2019 Kristi Noem, the governor of South Dakota, labeled the story \u2018#FakeNews from the liberal media.\u2019\u201d Only it wasn\u2019t fake. A 27-year-old man had been arrested, and according to police, he confessed to sexually assaulting the girl, the Columbus Dispatch reported. \u201cThe horrific story of one little girl in America is not just a reminder that we still struggle to believe women and girls,\u201d wrote Ziegler. \u201cIt\u2019s a cautionary tale about how quick we are to demonize some girls and women. If we have worked to trust and support victims of sexual violence, many of us have too often left people seeking abortion out of the equation.\u201d For more: Kara Alaimo: The dangers of abortion misinformation Brad Snyder: The Supreme Court\u2019s red herring argument The epicenter of the world\u2019s air travel chaos last week was the busiest airport serving London. Peggy Drexler noted that \u201con a recent weekday at Heathrow Airport, almost a third of scheduled flights were late; about 2% of all scheduled flights were canceled. \u2026 The airport has now asked airlines to stop selling more tickets this summer.\u201d As Drexler wrote, demand for travel is high. \u201cHaving lost out on traveling farther afield for much of the last two years, many of us assumed we\u2019d finally have the summer we\u2019d been waiting for,\u201d she wrote. But now, \u201csuddenly, what had felt like one of our only respites \u2013 the classic summer jaunt \u2013 feels as stressful as being stuck at home for yet another summer.\u201d \u201cThe key to getting through the challenge of summer travel \u2013 should you choose to accept it \u2013 will be about managing your expectations, knowing where you fall on the risk/reward spectrum (that is, understanding whether the benefits of travel for you outweigh the very real risks), learning what you can control for yourself and knowing if you can let go of the rest.\u201d After a trip to Israel, President Biden flew to Saudi Arabia for his much-anticipated encounter with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS). \u201cBiden\u2019s visit to Saudi Arabia was a victory for MBS, as it granted him the recognition he craves,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cThat\u2019s why the palace rushed to broadcast the pictures of Biden fist bumping the prince \u2013 never mind that Biden likely meant it as a sign of chilliness. If the Saudis raise oil and natural gas output, helping ease the price of fuel as the West prepares for winter without Russian gas supplies; if they loosen more restrictions on women; if they allow now-restricted American citizens to leave the country, then we will know it was worth it. \u201cIt was a gamble. Let\u2019s hope it pays off.\u201d There was strong incentive for visiting the nation which candidate Joe Biden had labeled a \u201cpariah\u201d after the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi: \u201chigh gas prices are contributing to the worst inflation in the United States in four decades,\u201d as Peter Bergen noted. \u201cEvery US president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has made similar calculations of the kind that Biden is making about the House of Saud. Sure, the Saudi monarchs may be despots \u2013 slavery was only officially abolished in the kingdom in 1962, and MBS granted women the right to drive four years ago \u2013 but Saudi Arabia is one of the world\u2019s top oil producers and has around a sixth of the world\u2019s proven oil reserves, which means that the Saudis can open up the taps and let the price of oil fall, or they can close the taps and the price of oil will rise. \u201cRelations between nations are based on shared interests, and the US-Saudi relationship is bound up not only with ensuring a steady supply of reasonably priced oil but also with counterterrorism initiatives and efforts to try and contain Iranian influence in the region,\u201d Bergen wrote.

Fallen by the wayside is Musk\u2019s avowed intention to restore Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account, which was permanently suspended after the January 6 riot. As Dean Obeidallah wrote, the Trump-Musk bromance is over. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago that the Trump-Musk relationship was warm, complete with public displays of affection. In January 2020, Trump likened Musk to Thomas Edison, gushing that he\u2019s \u2018one of our great geniuses \u2026 and we want to cherish those people.\u2019\u201d \u201cMusk is a \u2018bulls**t artist,\u2019 Donald Trump bellowed to applause at a rally in Alaska \u2026 the former President made the remark in response to Musk\u2019s recent comment that he had never voted for a Republican before a June special election in Texas,\u201d Obeidallah noted. The former President claimed that Tesla\u2019s chief executive had told him he voted for Trump. Meanwhile, Musk indicated he is leaning toward supporting another potential 2024 Republican candidate \u2013 Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

Nicole Hemmer was captivated. \u201cThe first deep field photograph showed not just unprecedented details of deep space but of deep history: some of the galaxies it captured are \u2013 or were \u2013 13.1 billion light-years away, meaning the images we saw offered glimpses of the universe in its infancy. \u201cAt a moment when life on Earth has felt increasingly cramped and shuttered, hemmed in by pandemic shutdowns and border-obsessed nationalisms, getting lost in that vision of the vastness of the universe felt freeing. Tiny, fragile, fractious Earth, not even a blue dot in the crowded crush of galaxies on display in the Webb photographs, is surrounded by endless possibility.\u201d Writing for CNN Opinion, NASA Administrator Bill Nelson observed that the Webb telescope alters \u201cour understanding of the universe.\u201d \u201cThese images show Webb\u2019s power in searching for the markers of life and habitability on other worlds. Its extreme sensitivity will help scientists understand some of the great open questions about how and why stars form, and it will bring into clarity stars and galaxies in a way we\u2019ve never seen before. From new-forming stars to devouring black holes, this telescope will reveal all this and more. \u201cLess than 100 years ago, we discovered that our Milky Way is just one of many throughout our universe.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. The conservative-controlled Supreme Court has thrown out Roe v. Wade, rolling back women\u2019s rights a half-century. Senate Republicans are using the filibuster to block voting rights, climate legislation and President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping plan to strengthen the middle class. Republican governors like Gregg Abbott of Texas are banning books, while Ron DeSantis of Florida is targeting transgender youth. Meanwhile, many Republicans are still lying about the outcome of the 2020 election \u2013 and, in the case of Missouri Republican Senate hopeful Eric Greitens, suggesting the use of violence against their political foes (Greitens claims he was just being metaphorical). So, with women\u2019s and trans rights under assault, the planet on fire and democracy under assault, some Democrats are furious with\u2026 Biden. Opinion: It's time for Democrats to take a page from the GOP playbook Really. Why are they mad at Biden? Biden didn\u2019t overturn Roe. In fact, he named a brilliant justice, Ketanji Brown Jackson, to the Supreme Court, and he has called on the Senate to drop the filibuster to protect women\u2019s right to choose. Biden isn\u2019t denying climate change. In fact, on his first day in office he rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, and he has convened 40 world leaders in a summit on how best to approach the challenges posed by climate change. Biden didn\u2019t kill voting rights. In fact, he traveled to Atlanta, the home of Martin Luther King Jr.  and former Rep. John Lewis, to chastise Senate Republicans for standing in the way of protecting voting rights, even comparing them to infamous segregationists George Wallace and Bull Connor. And yet, some in the Democratic Party are complaining about the President and his approach to governance. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Tina Smith of Minnesota have called on Biden to declare a national emergency over the rollback of abortion rights and to set up abortion clinics on federal land \u2013 despite the legal ban on federal funding for most abortions, and the reality that such a move could put doctors and women at risk of arrest when they depart federal land within a state that has outlawed abortion. \u201cWe need our president at this moment to step up and remind everyone that we Democrats don\u2019t believe the government should be making a decision about whether to continue a pregnancy,\u201d Warren told Politico on June 27 \u2013 three days after Biden had already issued a statement decrying the \u201cdevastating consequences\u201d of the court\u2019s ruling, calling on Congress to codify Roe and announcing executive action to protect women\u2019s rights to travel to seek abortions and to protect access to medication that induces abortion. This may be Democrats' only chance to blunt a red wave in November Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri gave voice to the exasperation of many progressives, telling the Washington Post, \u201cThey [Democrats] just aren\u2019t fighting. When people see that, what\u2019s going to make them show up to vote? We can\u2019t just tell people, \u2018Well, just vote \u2013 vote your problems away.\u2019 Because they\u2019re looking at us and saying, \u2018Well, we already voted for you.\u2019\u201d I share the frustration, as I imagine Biden does, too. And, to be fair to his Democratic critics, Biden is far from infallible. In fact, if we were sitting down over a beer, you might even get me to agree with some of his critics.  After all, former President Bill Clinton, my old boss and the most open-minded adult I\u2019ve ever known, loved to quote Benjamin Franklin, who said: \u201cCritics are our friends; they show us our faults.\u201d But perhaps Biden could use fewer such friends. That said, if, as Bush says, we can\u2019t vote our problems entirely away, we sure can\u2019t complain them away either. And the complaints about Biden are having an effect. A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed Biden\u2019s approval rating at just 25% among voters aged 18 to 34 years old and 33% among voters aged 35 to 49. In the 2020 election, younger voters were Biden\u2019s strongest age cohort; now they are his weakest. And, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll, 64% of Democrats now want a different leader to be the standard bearer in 2024. But the reality is that Biden has, in fact, done a ton of good despite GOP obstructionism. His American Rescue Plan invested more than $13 billion in minority-serving institutions of higher education, more than $10 billion in community colleges, $2.6 billion in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and about $190 million in tribal colleges and universities. Ex-Dem state senator on how Biden can fend off potential 2024 challengers from within party His policies \u2013 especially the child tax credit in his rescue package \u2013 reduced child poverty, keeping some six million kids from falling into poverty. Young people, and all of us who know and love them, should be singing Biden\u2019s praises for what he has done, not criticizing him for what the Republicans have blocked him from doing. I am old enough to remember when it was right-wing Republicans who were hellbent on tearing down Democratic presidents like Barack Obama and Clinton; now the progressives are practically doing the GOP\u2019s job for them. I have a radical proposal for my progressive friends: Stop attacking Biden and start attacking Republicans. If you think Biden is too weak, don\u2019t weaken him further for goodness sakes. Strengthen him, so he can lead the way forward. Two progressive Democrats from California have the right idea. Rep. Ro Khanna, who was national co-chair of Bernie Sanders\u2019 2020 presidential campaign, told the Washington Post that Biden, \u201cdidn\u2019t get [to the White House] by accident. He\u2019s the president of the United States, he\u2019s the leader of our party. He defeated Donald Trump. He\u2019s owed a degree of respect.\u201d In an email to me, Khanna elaborated: \u201cThe Democratic Party has been the greatest vehicle for economic justice, social justice and racial justice in the last 100 years.\u201d Khanna\u2019s message to progressive critics: \u201cHelp build the party and make it bolder. Don\u2019t undermine it. It\u2019s our best shot at progress.\u201d  Similarly, instead of attacking Biden, California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom ran an ad in Florida attacking Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Newsom blasted the conservative governor, saying \u201cFreedom is under attack\u201d in Florida. \u201cThey\u2019re banning books,\u201d Newsom says, \u201cmaking it harder to vote, restricting speech in classrooms, even criminalizing women and doctors.\u201d As \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d plays in the background, Newsom reclaims patriotism, freedom and the flag. It is masterful \u2013 and does not include a word of whining about Biden. Attacking your political opponents instead of your party\u2019s president? What a novel concept.  I hope it catches on. My message to my progressive friends is this: We\u2019re all in the same boat, so stop poking holes in the boat and then complaining that Biden is getting you wet.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Diane McWhorter is the author of \u201cCarry Me Home.\u201d The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. The January 6 commission\u2019s emergency hearing last week cracked open an alternate reality in which maybe, perhaps, cross-your-heart-hope-to-die, former President Donald Trump won\u2019t get away with it this time \u2013 and on top of that, election deniers finally got some comeuppance from GOP voters at the polls. But before exhaling all the way, let\u2019s check in on our country\u2019s favorite bellwether state, where Team Normal defeated Team Coup last month in the Republican runoff for the Alabama Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Richard Shelby. Shelby is the classic un-Trump, an old-school conservative who\u2019s been a senator for 36 years, and his presumptive successor is his former chief of staff. But the \u201cChristian conservative\u201d path his mentee took to victory laid bare the injury that thinking Republicans like Shelby have done to country if not God. More than Trump, it is they who will have to answer for the death, if it comes, of our republic. So how, in the reddest of red states, did Katie Britt, a 40-year-old Rotary Republican lawyer (or RINO on today\u2019s curve, Republican in Name Only), manage to rout the candidate advertising himself as \u201cMAGA Mo\u201d Brooks? He was the Congressman who raged at the January 6 \u201cSave America\u201d rally wearing Kevlar under a windbreaker that matched the traditional black-and-gold of the Proud Boys \u2013 and shortly after asked the outgoing Trump administration for a presidential pardon. Trump had withdrawn his initial endorsement of Brooks, who then explained he had rebuffed the ex-president\u2019s orders, well into the Biden administration, to \u201crescind\u201d the election results. And lo, after Britt demanded an investigation of Dr. Anthony Fauci, made a pilgrimage to  \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s Wall,\u201d and called abortion \u201cmurder,\u201d Trump bestowed his endorsement on her \u2013 once she had pulled ahead in the polls, of course. Opinion: Democrats may be playing with fire this primary season There is plenty of blame to go around, some of it blue, for the Trumpist world that rising young politicians like Britt are inheriting. (She faces futile Democratic opposition in November.) But often, in our obsession with the personal malignancy of Donald Trump, we tend to give a pass to those institutional players who might have contained him before his pathologies became civically systemic. Republicans in the Senate like Shelby (a former Democrat), Charles Grassley, Roy Blunt and on down the roster to especially Mitch McConnell were the adults who knew better, aloof from the cult of crazy. Yet when called to fulfill their oath to the Constitution in not one but two impeachment trials, they did nothing, even though taking a stand would ultimately have cost them little \u2013 not that their oath includes any such opt-out. How must these statesmen feel now that the Ukrainian head of state they refused to punish Trump for kneecapping has become the Winston Churchill of our time? We\u2019ve endured years of the abnormal being normalized, and now the corollary of that is being enshrined in the current election season: Normal has been rendered taboo. Hence, Britt could not afford to acknowledge a ritual so routine in American life that it has taken place every four years since 1789: A presidential election was held, and the results were deemed legitimate. An NBC reporter briefly perforated her Stop-the-Steal-ish mantra and got her to admit she would have objected to the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory if she were in the Senate \u2013 which even Shelby did not do. Opinion: What post-Nixon Congress could teach post-Trump Congress Britt also said she will vote for Trump if he runs in 2024, confirming that politically there\u2019s not much difference between her and Brooks other than the color of his January 6 windbreaker. (The Congressman told me by email via his communications director that he didn\u2019t know what the Proud Boys\u2019 \u201csurmised\u201d colors were and had \u201cpurchased that windbreaker more than a decade ago while my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary in Bermuda.\u201d It apparently just happened to be in his office closet on January 6.) At any rate, Cassidy Hutchinson\u2019s testimony at last week\u2019s January 6 hearing helped explain why Brooks put on body armor to appear before those weaponized \u201cAmerican patriots.\u201d In their stoic grandeur, the panel\u2019s proceedings seem directed at a single goal: holding Trump accountable for his high crimes. In our continuing need to understand how the United States of America could have made such a man president, the still-democratic majority keeps hoping that if we present one more piece of proof, if his own people testify against him, then his supporters will come to their senses and the union can survive. But as William Faulkner warned in Life magazine 66 years ago, the mindset we now call MAGA is impervious to reason or consequences. The novelist\u2019s 1956 \u201cA Letter to the North\u201d making a case against \u201ccompulsory integration\u201d of the South (although he was equally \u201copposed to compulsory racial inequality\u201d) warned that his region was never going to be changed \u201cby the simple will of the national majority backed by legal edict.\u201d Opinion: This is so much worse than Watergate The North seemed to think the Civil War had taught the South that it was wrong. But the southerner, including Robert E. Lee, \u201calready knew he was wrong,\u201d Faulkner wrote, \u201cand accepted that gambit even when he knew it was a fatal one.\u201d Likewise, as the January 6 hearings have laid out with grim meticulousness, Donald Trump and his men and women knew what they were doing not only was wrong but, according to Hutchinson\u2019s sworn testimony, potentially encompassed  \u201cevery crime imaginable.\u201d That insurrection proceeded as well. The Zeitgeist described by Faulkner may explain why we liberals from Alabama seem to be succumbing to the soft insanity of low expectations. A Democratic strategist there who knows Britt confided in me: \u201cHopefully she can return to who she is and not who they\u2019re pushing her to be.\u201d The allure of the lesser evil gave a group of Democratic women a fleeting moral quandary when Britt asked them to stand with her against her more extremist primary opponents. But really, is a MAGA impostor less bad for the country than a MAGA believer or only more competent, like the Trumpists who did help overthrow the will of the American majority: his appointees to the Supreme Court. Nonetheless. The irrepressible Charlie Brown in me hoped Shelby might see a legacy gimme in a vote to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Court. Once again it would have cost him nothing \u2013 his aye would not have been decisive \u2013 and might even mitigate the stink of the impeachment acquittals, each as foregone as the verdict of an all-White Jim Crow jury. Still, Shelby voted no with Republicans like Lindsey Graham, who took pains not to claim that now-Justice Jackson \u201clikes what\u2019s happening in child pornography.\u201d  And so the most impressive achievement Shelby leaves behind is the military-industrial complex he supplied with lavish federal aerospace and defense contracts in Alabama\u2019s 5th Congressional district, which sent Brooks to Washington to chew off the \u201cBig Government\u201d hand that fed it. The local monument to the senator\u2019s powerful career is the Shelby Center for Science and Technology at the University of Alabama Huntsville. The building is best known as the scene of the 2010 mass shooting in which Amy Bishop, a biology professor denied tenure, pulled a semi-automatic pistol out of her purse during a faculty meeting and executed three colleagues (she pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence). On the bipartisan gun-safety bill recently signed into law, Shelby voted against even sending it to the Senate floor, leaving his A+ NRA rating unbloodied. Shelby\u2019s presumptive successor is of course a champion of the \u201cGod-given Second Amendment,\u201d but she also sells herself as a \u201cMama on a mission.\u201d  To a future Senator Britt, that means that \u201cour children should be taught to love this country\u201d \u2013 a nation so exceptional that our children die at their school desks in order to preserve our freedoms.",

He is a professor emeritus of journalism at Brooklyn College. The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. \u201cBig Tim\u201d Sullivan was in great form on the day he cajoled fellow state senators into approving a landmark New York gun law, the one that the US Supreme Court has now overturned some 111 years later. His speech \u201cwas crude and illiterate, but it was human, forceful and replete with sympathetic illustrations taken from the actual life of the East Side,\u201d the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper said of Sullivan, a powerful Tammany Hall district leader who was renowned for the thousands of meals, pairs of shoes and jobs he gave out to his immigrant constituents, but also notorious for his thinly veiled underworld connections. The Legislature passed what quickly became known as the Sullivan Law with only a handful of nays. Now, the Supreme Court\u2019s June 23 ruling has found that the law violated the Second Amendment by giving authorities broad discretion to decide who would get a permit to carry a concealed weapon. The lead petitioner in the case, the New York State Rifle and Pistol Association, argued that the licensing process was actually designed to discriminate: \u201cthe law was passed with an avowed intent, supported by everybody from City Hall to the New York Times, to disarm newly arrived immigrants, particularly those with Italian surnames.\u201d Its brief says that, according to the Times, 70% of those arrested under the Sullivan Law during its first three years \u201chad Italian surnames.\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas picked up on this anti-minority theme in the court\u2019s majority opinion, writing of how Black people were deprived of the right to arm themselves in the post-Civil War South. In an amicus brief, public-defender groups representing indigent defendants drew a direct link from historical discrimination to today\u2019s mainly Black and Hispanic defendants. \u201cNew York enacted its firearm licensing requirements to criminalize gun ownership by racial and ethnic minorities,\u201d they argued. \u201cThat remains the effect of its enforcement by police and prosecutors today. The consequences for our clients are brutal.\u201d The origin of the Sullivan Law is more complicated than that, although it is true that New York\u2019s lively press emphasized its use against Italians, who were stereotyped under the racist eugenics of the day as inherently prone to violence. The Times didn\u2019t actually carry a story saying that over 70% of those charged under the Sullivan Law had Italian names (at least none that I have discovered in my research on the topic), although the number is often used in the gun debate. It is based on a 1990 study published by the Second Amendment Foundation, which opposes gun control laws. The study surveys all the gun arrests reported in the Times following the law\u2019s passage; the finding may only prove that the newspaper took a particular interest in publicizing the crimes of people whose names ended in a vowel. The Times seemed to have an anti-immigrant streak in those days. More reliable data can be found in a New York State report on convictions during the year that ended October 31, 1912: 35% of the 381 people convicted of carrying a concealed weapon in New York City were born in Italy.  This was still more than double the percent of Italian-born residents in the city, but the Italian population skewed toward young men, the group most likely to be arrested for a gun offense. The drive to toughen New York\u2019s gun laws intensified with two shootings that had nothing to do with immigrants. James Gallagher, fuming over the loss of his $2-a-day city job, shot New York City Mayor William J. Gaynor in the summer of 1910 as he stood on the deck of a ship about to depart for a cruise to Europe. Once considered presidential material, Gaynor returned to City Hall two months later, a shattered man suffering from the bullet still lodged in his throat. Then, in January, the slaying of popular novelist David Graham Phillips on the north side of Manhattan\u2019s Gramercy Park \u2013 and the accompanying suicide of the assailant, a mentally ill violinist from a socially prominent family \u2013 shocked the public. Soon after, the New York City coroner called for harsher gun laws because of the increase from 68 gun-related homicides in 1909 to 108 in 1910. Sullivan had already started campaigning for an anti-gun law. The Tammany man allied on the issue with his arch-enemies, the reformers who normally thought of him as a symbol of graft, gambling, prostitution and election fraud. Say what one will about Sullivan\u2019s motives, but he was not anti-immigrant. A dapper six-foot 200-pounder with steely blue eyes, \u201cthe Big Feller\u201d courted the Jewish and Italian immigrant voters who dominated in his Lower East Side district. Opinion: The Supreme Court's gun ruling is the triumph of conservatives over common sense Sullivan pushed the gun bill during his 1910 election campaign, telling constituents crowded into a local theater, \u201cThe gun toter and the tough man \u2013 I don\u2019t want his vote, for I\u2019m going to put him in jail as soon as I get back to Albany.\u201d He knew his people and their needs; it\u2019s clear that his stance was acceptable to them. But it is true that many of his allies on the gun law \u2013 good-government groups, business leaders and reform-friendly newspapers \u2013 understood the measure as a tool to go after Italian immigrants. \u201cIt was the intent of this beneficent law that hot-headed and impulsive people of the temperament of your race should be restrained from carrying weapons,\u201d Judge Warren Foster told the first defendant convicted under the law, laborer Marino Rossi. The quote brought the judge an accolade in the Times: \u201cThe judge\u2019s warning to the Italian community was timely and exemplary.\u201d From the start, there were questionable \u201csweeps\u201d on gangland turf \u2013 aimed at Irish, Jewish and Italian hoodlums \u2013 and unnecessary arrests of people like workingman Rossi, foreshadowing contemporary controversies over police stop-and-frisk tactics. But the new law also helped police nab dangerous gangsters on felony charges without the long-shot task of persuading witnesses to testify against them. We see that in an arrest made by Detective Charles Carrao, first recipient of the NYPD\u2019s highest award, the Medal of Honor, four days after the law went into effect. He caught the elusive leader of a band of extortionists with a bomb under his coat (considered a concealed weapon at the time). It was the rare occasion when a gang leader was sent up the river to Sing Sing.  The Sullivan Law survived numerous legal challenges, but the die was cast when the Supreme Court unscrambled the ambiguous syntax of the Second Amendment in the favor of gun advocates. In a 2008 ruling, it concluded that the right to possess a firearm was guaranteed to individual Americans and \u201cunconnected with service in a militia.\u201d Sullivan, ever the mystery, died in 1913 in shadowy circumstances, his body identified in the morgue after he\u2019d been missing for almost two weeks. Big Tim made a few judges in his time, and would no doubt have seen the Supreme Court\u2019s decision as strictly a matter of politics. Then he would have gone to work figuring out a way around it.",

Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization has, since its publication in early May, stirred a firestorm over the fate of abortion rights in the United States. As Americans reckon with the impending US Supreme Court decision \u2013 expected later this month \u2013 that could undo nearly 50 years of precedent, CNN Opinion has published commentary from an array of writers on abortion and the most anticipated legal opinion in decades. From the personal to the political, their perspectives reveal the role that access to abortion has played across history or in their own lives \u2013 and convey what the court\u2019s decision could mean for the country at large. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are their own. The Supreme Court seems ready to undo Roe v. Wade, the landmark case recognizing the right to choose abortion, in a matter of weeks, and blue as well as red states are already preparing for what might be coming next: a conflict between states seeking to facilitate out-of-state travel for abortion and those trying to shut it down. Strikingly, however, this brewing interstate war would be something relatively new. What has changed to make interstate conflict a possible new front in the abortion wars, and what does it mean for a post-Roe America? Read more. Mary Ziegler is the author of \u201cAbortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present\u201d and the forthcoming book \u201cDollars for Life: The Anti-Abortion Movement and the Fall of the Republican Establishment.\u201d As one of the last two House Republicans who voted in support of women\u2019s reproductive rights, I have a nuanced perspective on abortion. During my time in Congress, I voted against defunding Planned Parenthood and against the 20-week abortion ban. That pleased pro-choice advocates. But parts of my voting record pleased pro-life advocates, too. For instance, I voted for the long-established Hyde Amendment wording contained in federal spending bills. This language prohibits federal funding for abortion except in cases of rape, incest and life or health of the mother. Read more.

He is a CNN political commentator. Since the moment of his birth, my 5-year-old son has been a near unalloyed joy, but the long journey to that moment was anything but joyous. My husband and I started trying for a child in 2013, and I quickly became pregnant. At 10 weeks, I had an unexplained miscarriage. I was rushed to the emergency room where I ultimately had a dilation and curettage, or D&C, to clear my womb of the self-aborted pregnancy. It took us over a year of trying before I became pregnant again. This time, I made it to the sonogram at the end of my first trimester, when doctors told us our baby had a condition that meant that he would likely die in utero. If he survived, he would only live for at most a few years, in a life spent in and out of the hospital. Ultimately, after extended soul-searching, I decided to abort the pregnancy, for the sake of both my existing family and my unborn son, a heart-wrenching decision I have written about elsewhere. In the painful aftermath of these two losses, we turned toward in vitro fertilization, in the hopes that IVF would finally give us the baby we both longed for. We were extremely fortunate that I became pregnant following our first IVF attempt. Read more. Laura Beers is a professor of history at American University.

As far as I am concerned, politics is about policy, not personality. I am unapologetic about supporting a pro-life candidate who talked the talk, and walked the walk.

He (Alito) maintains voters, not courts, should decide whether abortion is legal. Overturning Roe, he argues, in fact empowers women, because it \u201callows women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office.\u201d Except the very court he sits on has restricted those rights: deciding a presidential election by stopping the 2000 recount (Bush v. Gore), diluting voters\u2019 lobbying power by allowing unlimited and anonymous campaign spending (Citizens United v. FEC) and gutting the Voting Rights Act (Shelby County v. Holder). As a result of all this, the current court will allow a state to restrict access to both abortion and the ballot box. The escape hatch Alito offers opens on a brick wall. Read more.

I had money from a job at a fast-food restaurant and I paid. I stood in the waiting room \u2013 the seats were full of brown and Black and White faces from all over the city. I read People magazine while we waited. She was crying when she went in. One hour felt like 10. She was stoic when she came out\u2026.

His work has appeared in The New York Times, CNN and elsewhere. For Black women living in the South, the birthplace of racial slavery and its afterlife that produced health disparities and racist practices such as forced sterilization, the effects of a post-Roe America promise to be particularly acute. Historically, Black women have lacked access to humane and decent health care. This continues in the present, where even upper-middle-class Black women suffer worse maternal health outcomes than their White economic peers. Why does this happen even in the 21st century? The answer lies in the systemic racism that pervades every aspect of America\u2019s institutions, especially health care. Read more. Peniel E.

Abortion funds and states codifying Roe v. Wade are undeniably crucial to the survival of so many, but they can only do so much. Voter participation will be critical, but we need to learn from Colombia, Argentina, Mexico and elsewhere to pressure our elected officials to protect our health and our humanity.

I believe that abortion harms women. It allows men to get off consequence-free after having fathered a child and avoid the responsibilities of fatherhood. It undermines the beauty of motherhood and tells women that their children are a hindrance to their dreams and that life is not a blessing. After Roe, I believe it will be possible for our nation to be one that doesn\u2019t cast judgment on women who become pregnant, but one that embraces them with love and compassion. And it must also be one that always protects human life and appreciates the intrinsic value of each being from the moment of conception. Over the decades, this debate has been characterized by hostility and villainization on both the abortion-rights and anti-abortion sides. Only honest dialogue can help heal a fractured culture that has so painfully betrayed women. We\u2019ll need that dialogue once Roe is gone, and the national conversation turns to how we can support those facing crisis pregnancies and their children. Read more.

That illegalizing abortion will deepen racial inequities is an uncomfortable reality for those who propose doing so. It is no surprise then that, in the run-up to the upcoming Supreme Court decision on abortion, leading pro-life organizations have testified to their own diversity. Those testimonies invariably invoke the same woman: Mildred Fay Jefferson, a pro-life leader and the first Black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School. In the last few months, the National Right to Life Committee honored her, the head of the Susan B. Anthony List wrote of her in an opinion piece and Americans United for Life published a guide to pro-life legislation under an imprint it named for her: Mildred Press. That Jefferson remains, more than a decade after her 2010 death, a pro-life hero is no surprise. A Black Methodist woman, she embodied the aspirations of a movement that, upon her election in 1975 as president of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), was composed almost entirely of White Catholic men.

Norton). If Roe is overturned, a number of states have trigger laws in place that will almost immediately make abortion illegal. The broad drafting of some abortion trigger laws defines the start of pregnancy as the moment of fertilization, thereby encompassing not only fetuses but also embryos and even fertilized eggs. This degree of protection, persistently advocated for by the personhood movement, creates a legal quagmire with potentially terrifying ramifications. Criminalizing abortion opens the door for people to be charged with murder or manslaughter for miscarriages over which they have no control. Since Roe, there have been hundreds of instances in which a woman\u2019s pregnancy has been a decisive factor in attempted and actual deprivations of her physical liberty. Court cases of past years offer a glimpse of how vulnerable pregnant people are to legal action. Read more. Read more. Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London.

View more opinion articles on CNN. Juneteenth 2022, which the nation officially celebrates Monday, is unfolding against extraordinary twin backdrops: the ongoing hearings of the House select committee on January 6 and the continuing legislative efforts to halt or disrupt the teaching of the very history that Juneteenth \u2013 a day that marks the end of racial slavery in the United States \u2013 commemorates. President Joe Biden\u2019s signing into law a measure making Juneteenth a federal holiday in 2021 came on the heels of the racial justice upheavals of 2020 that followed the murder of George Floyd. Juneteenth had long been an occasion more informally celebrating the news of freedom from slavery (belatedly) reaching Black Americans in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865. It seemed that virtually overnight, the law establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day transformed this day from a Texas-based African American celebration into a national symbol of the enduring need to confront a long-denied history of racial slavery and its afterlife. The story of Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger delivering the news of Black people\u2019s hard-earned path toward citizenship and dignity became a metaphor for America in 2020, which was weighed down by a pandemic and convulsing with demonstrations demanding an end to structural racism in the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s murder. I, alongside other writers, scholars, historians, and culture workers, found hope in the resurgent interest in Black history that accompanied both the protests and the elevation of Juneteenth as a federal holiday. One manifestation of that hopefulness for positive change was the proliferation of best-selling books focusing on Black history, including  \u201cThe New Jim Crow,\u201d a history of mass incarceration by Michelle Alexander. In that context, Juneteenth became more than just a part of the national conversation about efforts to achieve racial justice in America. The history behind Juneteenth served as an important aspect of a broader impetus many felt to do some wide-ranging soul searching. Black History Month exposes the fallacy of White 'discomfort' Those efforts were visible among sports leagues proclaiming that Black Lives Matter, elected officials marching with BLM demonstrators and museum and popular culture curators and ordinary Americans finally acknowledging the depth and breadth of systemic racism. The entire nation seemed chastened by the summer of unrest and inspired to do the personal and political work to make some long overdue changes. Yet Black History Month unfolded in 2022 alongside a spate of legislation purposefully designed to prevent the teaching of this history and the lessons it imparts. In Florida, a bill designed to prevent \u201cpsychological distress\u201d to White students and teachers during the teaching of histories tied to systemic racism passed in April. In Virginia, Republican Glenn Youngkin successfully exploited the made-up controversy over so-called \u201ccritical race theory\u201d (CRT) to become governor as the state banned the teaching of parts of American history now deemed too dangerous to share with young people. Critics of CRT weaponized White outrage at the expense of Black parents whose opinions and voices were left out of the public debate in a matter that further amplified the nation\u2019s racial divide. Opinion: I was seriously injured while protecting the Capitol. Don't tell me January 6 didn't happen The January 6 assault on the Capitol was more like a grassroots cousin of the legislative backlash organized by the GOP. This violent attack on the US Capitol echoed and reiterated the White supremacist politics of the Reconstruction era, where baseless allegations of voter fraud helped rationalize the violent killing of Black people and their supporters. Congressional hearings in 1871 led to the passage of anti-Klan legislation, but such policies were rarely if ever enforced, leading to full-scale attacks on Black political power that culminated in the 1898 White political coup in Wilmington, North Carolina. The January 6 hearings, with their dramatic narrative of an American president bent on breaking the rule of law by inventing conspiracy theories of electoral fraud, is a perfect example of why Juneteenth is so important. According to the Washington Post, more than 100 GOP primary winners have touted former Presidents Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election into successful primary victories. The hearings offer an unvarnished portrait of one of the most disturbing episodes in American history, one whose reverberations threaten democracy at its very core. The mistrust sowed, exploited and weaponized by Trump and the GOP are rooted in fear, anxiety, and anger about Black citizenship, specifically the legitimacy of Black voting power \u2013 a threat that first came into being in Juneteenth\u2019s aftermath with the passage of the Reconstruction amendments. Opinion: Black consumers like me want change \u2014 not Juneteenth-branded products Juneteenth 2022 matters now more than ever. So far, we have only scratched the surface of what this holiday potentially allows all Americans to explore. I grew up listening to stories of Juneteenth in New York City from Black Texan transplants in the Big Apple. They made me understand, for the first time, the intimate links between the past and present. As a federal holiday, Juneteenth now offers a window for Americans into understanding how the political is also personal. The Black folk who bled for democracy \u2013 during and after the Civil War, across generations of racial injustice during a century of Jim Crow racial segregation, fighting heroically in World Wars, protesting on domestic battlefields for civil rights \u2013 are as crucial to our national story as the heroes of the American Revolution. Their legacies surround us, opening a deeper faith in America\u2019s democratic values and history than the forces that would have us bury the past in order to control the future. For now, the extraordinary and continuing crisis of race and democracy in America shows no signs of abating. The histories that are being suppressed by GOP legislation are, in fact, profoundly American ones.  The highest example of patriotism is not a sanitized version of American history, popularized after the Civil War in  \u201cLost Cause\u201d nostalgia  that redefined a war to end slavery as a battle over states\u2019 rights \u2013 glossing over racial violence, greed and exploitation of Black labor in favor of more sepia-toned images of a pastoral American landscape that in fact, never truly existed. Yet the very fact that America now officially commemorates Juneteenth is still a sign of hopeful, if simultaneously fragile, racial progress. The first holiday in the nation\u2019s history that reckons directly with racial slavery and the Black contribution to American freedom, Juneteenth serves as an annual reminder of the enormous power and potential of a multiracial democracy that remains in many ways as fraught in our time as it was during Reconstruction. As the nation prepares, in only four short years from now, to celebrate 250 years of independence, it is worth remembering that Juneteenth, as much as the Fourth of July, represents American democracy\u2019s true birthday.",

Millions of Americans have responded to the horrific mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde with wrenching and public displays of anger, sadness and rage against the nation\u2019s broken political system. This latest tragedy comes a little more than one week after 10 people were killed in a racist hate crime that purposefully targeted Buffalo\u2019s Black community. The massacre in Uvalde coincided, almost to the day, with the second anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s murder. Two years later it is worth questioning: how much has really changed? Opinion: This is how we stem America's mass shootings That\u2019s a question without a satisfying answer. But as so many in America grieve and grapple with their anger, it\u2019s striking that a chorus of White men are among the loudest and most visible voices exposing the fundamental crisis of American democracy, for all the world to see. There is something particularly significant about the fact that three high-profile White men, all leaders in different fields, are speaking out about the underlying crisis that allowed the horrors in Uvalde and elsewhere to continue unabated. So much of contemporary American politics seems to pit people of color on one side and a declining White majority on the other. And yet Steve Kerr, Matthew McConaughey and Beto O\u2019Rourke all serve as courageous models for a progressive White male identity that challenges systems of oppression, speaks truth to power and confronts the divisions of our current moment by publicly highlighting the gap between the nation\u2019s professed values and a more bitter reality that allows nineteen children to be killed in such grotesque fashion. Steve Kerr, the three-time NBA championship-winning head coach of the Golden State Warriors, conducted a news conference Tuesday that turned into a bold political sermon. \u201cWhen are we going to do something?\u201d demanded Kerr, who challenged all Americans to let their voices be heard and to demand justice in the memory of those lost in Uvalde and Buffalo. Kerr, a longtime advocate for gun reform whose own family has been touched by violence, has a history of making powerful political statements. There was also actor Matthew McConaughey, who was born in Uvalde. He released a statement after the shooting that openly questioned the nation\u2019s moral and political values. \u201cWe cannot exhale, make excuses, and once again accept these realities as the status quo,\u201d observed McConaughey. A similarly enraged Beto O\u2019Rourke, a former presidential contender now running for Texas governor, interrupted a Wednesday news conference with Gov. Greg Abbott and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, to publicly accuse Abbott of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d to halt gun violence, besides perfunctory statements and news conferences that avoid the heart of the issue. Abbott is currently scheduled to speak at the National Rifle Association (NRA) convention Friday in Houston. Opinion: The one thing Ted Cruz gets right about guns The seemingly rote nature of the news conference before O\u2019Rourke\u2019s intervention struck a profoundly sharp contrast with the officials\u2019 reactions to the interruption. Patrick called O\u2019Rourke \u201can embarrassment.\u201d US Sen. Ted Cruz told him to \u201csit down,\u201d while Uvalde Mayor Don McLaughlin shouted profanities at him. The anger and vitriol officials directed at O\u2019Rourke was noteworthy, but even more shocking than that was the lack of anger shown during the proceedings about the reason they were all there in the first place. Kerr, McConaughey and O\u2019Rourke are all trying to direct Americans\u2019 attention toward the way in which our nation\u2019s democratic atrophy is costing the lives of our people, including children, our most very precious resource. According to Pew Research from April last year, 53% of Americans favor stricter gun control laws, though those policy perspectives are shaped by age, race, major party affiliation and gun ownership. Three in 10 Americans own guns and they tend to be White, male and Republican. Rural residents favor more access to guns and those who live in cities prefer more restrictions. While a majority of Americans believe in common sense gun control, the will of the people has been hijacked by the NRA\u2019s enormous power, whose influence over the Republican Party (and some conservative Democrats) is near absolute. Politicians, such as Utah senator and former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, have expressed grief over the children lost in Uvalde in one breath, while simultaneously accepting money and support from the NRA in the other. Make no mistake, this is about guns. But this is also about much more than guns. Opinion: What people don't get about guns and the Constitution The normalization of mass shootings and horrific violence is unfolding amid growing authoritarian, racist, anti-democratic and oligarchical tendencies that are harming America\u2019s identity as the world\u2019s leading democracy. Violence and hate against Black, Jewish, Asian American, Latinx and LGBTQ communities, especially over the last seven years, further erode America\u2019s democratic promise. Legislative efforts to suppress women\u2019s reproductive and bodily autonomy, voting rights, the teaching of racial justice and Black history in schools, and help for immigrants seeking sanctuary from crises at times stoked by US foreign policy, are also a form of political violence that has horribly weakened our country. The same party that is advocating placing control of women\u2019s bodies in the hands of local and state governments decries any such restrictions on the rights of citizens to own, operate and utilize weapons of war. The rise of social media misinformation, racist hate, the Big Lie regarding the 2020 election and growing economic inequality threaten to put a stake through the heart of freedoms long taken for granted. This is the death of democracy via a thousand cuts. So where do we go from here? The Uvalde massacre will not end the partisan warfare that engulfs the country, but it highlights the depth of our political divisions with a moral clarity that is too often missing from a political world that is too often portrayed as sport, complete with winners and losers of the latest news cycle. There are real people affected by public policy, legislative and legal decisions and the narratives we share to rationalize the unspeakable. When children can be mercilessly slaughtered in school and the majority\u2019s political will to take constructive action is stymied by a small group of politicians, donors and special interests, we cannot expect our democracy to survive. We cannot endure political business as usual.  At a news conference Wednesday announcing the signing of a new executive order on the anniversary of George Floyd\u2019s killing \u2013 one that will create a national federal registry of police officer misconduct and incentivize local cities and states to create more restrictions on chokeholds and no-knock warrants \u2013 President Joe Biden spoke about Uvalde. \u201cWhen in God\u2019s name will we do what needs to be done?\u201d to stop innocent children and families from being killed by gun violence, asked Biden. That question needs to be answered by Americans from all backgrounds, especially those who have experienced the horrifying pain of losing a loved one to gun violence. Two years after a painful moment of reckoning that seemed to promise the hope of democratic renewal for a nation scarred by a pandemic, massive economic crisis and racial divisions, we have regressed into familiar quarrels, recriminations and bad-faith arguments about our current crisis. We are long past the time for eloquent words and need to focus on deeds that might, in some small way, offer a measure of peace for the families of these lost children and offer a future where tragedies such as Uvalde are indeed unthinkable.",

He is the author and editor of 24 books, including, \u201cThe Presidency of Donald J. Trump: A First Historical Assessment.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Former President Donald Trump might get out-Trumped. As the campaign season accelerates, Trump has thrown his weight behind several Republican candidates. The point is not only to shape the electoral playing field but to offer clear evidence he still calls the shots within the GOP if he ends up running for reelection in 2024. Thus far, his endorsements have had mixed results. His biggest victory took place in Ohio, where J.D. Vance, the author of \u201cHillbilly Elegy,\u201d shed any hopes of reinventing the Republican establishment of yore and went all in with Trumpism. He defeated Josh Mandel in the GOP primary and emerged as a shining example of what team Mar-a-Lago can deliver. In West Virginia, Trump\u2019s pick Rep. Alex Mooney won the primary while in Nebraska, Charles Herbster, his favorite in the gubernatorial race, lost to Jim Pillen. But now something unexpected is happening in Pennsylvania, where Trump endorsed the television doctor Mehmet Oz. The alliance seemed perfect; two TV stars teaming up to try to win a US Senate seat in one of the most critical swing states. Oz, who had the ability to attract more moderate voters due to name recognition and lack of political baggage, would also have the Trumpian wind behind his back. Opinion: When will the GOP learn from Trump's mistakes? But the plan is running into a problem. Kathy Barnette, a hard-right candidate who is one of seven contenders in the state\u2019s Republican Senate primary, is polling right alongside Oz and former hedge fund manager Dave McCormick, despite a much smaller war chest. Barnette, who has delved into the Trumpian political world view with relish, has made numerous anti-gay and anti-Muslim comments. In 2015, she said it was OK to discriminate against Muslims and compared rejecting Islam to \u201crejecting Hitler\u2019s or Stalin\u2019s worldviews.\u201d She has also said, \u201cTwo men sleeping together, two men holding hands, two men caressing, that is not normal.\u201d Barnette has won the support of major conservative organizations such as the Club for Growth, an anti-tax group that sees in the Black conservative Republican a bright star for the party. When Barnette lost the race to represent Pennsylvania\u2019s 4th district by 19 percentage points in 2020, she refused to concede, and still hasn\u2019t. She used that loss to stoke baseless claims of voter fraud, gaining enough steam to attract figures on the right like MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. \u201cThe reason she has struck a chord is she NEVER conceded her House race loss,\u201d former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon told Axios, \u201cPennsylvania is MAGA v. ULTRA MAGA.\u201d It\u2019s clear here, Barnette is ultra. In other words, at least in Pennsylvania, a new generation of radical Republicans has emerged to take on the former president and his allies. While Barnette could very well lose to Oz or McCormick, her unexpected rise shows the direction the Republican Party is moving in. The story is certainly a twist, but it is not surprising. This is a phenomenon that has shaped the conservative movement since the 1970s. With each generation, a new brand of right-wing firebrand has emerged to define the moment, only to find themselves cast aside by up-and-comers who embrace an even more extreme form of smash-mouth partisanship and right-wing ideological worldview. This has been the story of a party that keeps moving further right, with centrists generally failing to rein in the GOP (with notable exceptions like George H.W. Bush). Opinion: Ohio primary proves the power of Trump's endorsement The Republican Party reset to center after right-wing Sen. Barry Goldwater\u2019s devastating landslide defeat to President Lyndon Johnson in 1964. But ever since Ronald Reagan\u2019s historic presidential victory against President Jimmy Carter in 1980, the GOP has been on a steady rightward trajectory. Starting with his inauguration in 1981, Reagan mainstreamed right-wing conservative ideas in a way that few others had been able to achieve. He would go on to find a congressional counterpart with Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich, who pioneered a no-guardrails approach to partisan warfare, establishing a new template for what was permissible to say or do in pursuit of political power. His influence is undeniable. A cohort of representatives who served in the House after 1978, the year Gingrich was first elected to the lower chamber, would go on to win Senate seats in the ensuing decades, becoming \u201cThe Gingrich Senators,\u201d as the political scientist Sean Theriault called them. The senators, having come up alongside Gingrich, are more conservative and willing to engage in obstruction, Theriault argues. Gingrich, of course, eventually became Speaker of the House when Republicans took over the chamber in 1995. But the 1980s generation of conservatism eventually gave way to young up-and-comers. In the 2008 election, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, an unknown governor from Alaska at the time, lit up the campaign trail by blasting the media and holding campaign rallies sending her supporters into a total frenzy. It wasn\u2019t unusual to hear people accusing the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama, of being a \u201cterrorist\u201d and playing into the worst racial tropes. Opinion: Will Trump be able to wade his way out of troubled waters again? Palin and her allies dismissed President George W. Bush\u2019s staunch Reagan conservatism \u2013 which centered around fighting for tax cuts, dismissing climate change science and flexing military force overseas after 9/11 \u2013 as a \u201cbig government v.\u201d Unlike Bush, who was part of a political dynasty, Palin presented herself in stark contrast as an everywoman positioned outside the federal political machine. Though the McCain-Palin ticket went down in defeat, the Tea Party came to town in the 2010 midterms and took up what can only be described as Gingrich-style politics on steroids. During their first year in office, the new members of Congress seriously threatened to send the federal government into default by refusing to raise the federal debt ceiling if President Obama didn\u2019t concede to draconian budget cuts. Tea Party Republicans delved into Birtherism and demonstrated how the conservative media could serve as a powerful platform for political propaganda and disinformation. They also turned on Republican Speaker John Boehner, who had once been a Gingrich ally and Republican renegade himself, dismissing him as too much of a compromising insider. Boehner, who had helped Tea Party candidates in the midterms, would later be extremely critical of their politics, calling Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan a \u201clegislative terrorist.\u201d In the Senate, Mitch McConnell showed how far the party was willing to go when he refused to even consider Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, in 2016. The Tea Party eventually morphed into the Freedom Caucus and became the most powerful force on the Hill. After Donald Trump was elected in 2016, many of them, such as Mick Mulvaney and Mark Meadows, found themselves inside the administration. But President Trump took things even further than they could have imagined. He took to Twitter, blasting his opponents and spreading blatant falsehoods without any restraint. He disrupted the traditional processes of governance and ignored norms as well as procedures, doing whatever was necessary to pursue his agenda.  Nothing would compare to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and to spread the \u201cBig Lie\u201d with so much force that it has become the equivalent of what anti-communism had been to the conservative movement in the 1980s. So it should come as no shock that in 2022, we are seeing a crop of candidates who will start to cast the former president as tame. They will eventually blame him for being too comfortable with the status quo and uninterested in shaking up the political \u201cestablishment.\u201d While Democrats keep coming back to their center with politicians such as President Biden or Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Republicans are continuing to go all in with the newest crop of extremists. The dynamic is almost inevitable as this is the history of the modern GOP.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She is morning editor at Katie Couric Media. She tweets @HolstaT. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion on CNN. Every weekday morning between January 20, 2017, and January 8, 2021, I checked President Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account. It was as critical a step in my routine as brushing my teeth \u2013 albeit one that left me feeling far less fresh. As a journalist primarily covering US news, monitoring Trump\u2019s account was essential. Even though fewer than a quarter of Americans say they use Twitter, Trump\u2019s caustic whims, jibes and attacks on the platform consistently set the agenda \u2013 and for several years it was normal to watch major news sites hastily switch out whatever lead story they\u2019d planned to reflect that morning\u2019s presidential caprice. Then, without ceremony, he was gone. Two days after the horrifying events of the Capitol insurrection on January 6, 2021, Twitter announced that it was suspending Trump\u2019s account permanently, in accordance with its policy on inciting violence. The daily clamor that had affected so many lives was extinguished in a second, and millions breathed relief. Smash cut to this week. Elon Musk, who\u2019s in the process of buying Twitter for $44 billion, has announced that once he\u2019s in charge, he\u2019ll undo Trump\u2019s Twitter ban \u2013 even though Trump claims he\u2019d rather stick to his own social media platform, Truth Social. A self-avowed champion of \u201cfree speech,\u201d Musk said that the decision to suspend Trump was \u201cmorally wrong\u201d and that it \u201cdidn\u2019t end Trump\u2019s voice. It will amplify it among the right.\u201d Both of those assertions are incorrect. Banning Trump was the only conscionable response to January 6 \u2013 and de-platforming is proven to quash provocateurs. But the fact that Musk is able to act on these ideas regardless speaks to an axiom that Trump himself exemplified: In today\u2019s America, one person with no conscience and access to the right pressure points can do almost anything they want. And as Trump\u2019s record shows, people who are prepared to misrepresent the truth as a means to \u2013 or excuse for \u2013 abusing their power once will almost certainly do so again. How will history remember the Twitter President? When Trump ran for president in 2016, he promised to make America \u201cgreat\u201d and \u201csafe.\u201d In November 2019, the New York Times investigated the 11,390 tweets he\u2019d sent in his presidency to date. Over half were attacks on other people, and they set the tone for his presidency. Trump ruptured US foreign policy, antagonized nations already at loggerheads and in fall 2017, tweeted that North Korea may not \u201cbe around much longer!\u201d \u2013 which the country\u2019s foreign minister called a \u201cdeclaration of war.\u201d When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Trump repeatedly referred to it as the \u201cChina virus,\u201d a label associated with a dramatic surge in anti-Asian racial hatred online. After he lost the US election, the lies he spread on Twitter were among his most popular posts ever, and stoked unprecedented violence. Of course, Trump\u2019s disregard for consequences extended far beyond social media. Even as he used his platform to erode faith in democratic institutions, Trump appointed Supreme Court justices whose explicit political affiliations would determine the fates of millions to endear himself to voters he believed would keep him in power. Elon Musk's move threatens to bring Trump back to the White House When he needed the evangelical vote, he promised he\u2019d appoint anti-abortion justices \u2013 abandoning his own former pro-choice stance. About 27% of the voting-eligible population voted for Trump in 2016, but now, 100% of the population will bear the fallout for decades to come. In the uncannily prescient words of Trump\u2019s onetime supporter Kanye West, \u201cno one man should have all that power\u201d \u2013 but he did. Increasingly, it appears Elon Musk is cut from similar cloth, and gaining similarly outsized influence. He constantly claims to prize free speech, but seems to misunderstand what it is \u2013 and has repeatedly proven himself a hypocrite when it comes to upholding it. Tesla employees, scores of whom have alleged racism, sexism and other forms of abuse, are bound by strict limitations on what they can say about the company. Tesla hides vehicle safety information from public view (in response to past media queries about its handling of safety data, Tesla did not comment), and Musk has often sought to control what journalists and bloggers write about both himself and his companies \u2013 once even canceling a customer\u2019s order when he discovered a blog post they\u2019d authored that he felt was \u201crude.\u201d Opinion: Who will be the first to abandon Elon Musk's Twitter? When a teenager tracked the progress of Musk\u2019s private jet on Twitter using publicly available information, Musk tried to shut him down.  Though he moves in a different sphere to Trump, his words also carry huge weight, moving stock markets via the most casual remarks on his Twitter feed. In the last few months, Musk has forged an association in the public mind between his name and free speech by sheer repetition, despite regular gaffes on the subject. He\u2019s said that people should be able to speak freely on Twitter \u201cwithin the bounds of the law,\u201d but also claims that some examples of \u201chate speech\u201d are \u201cfine,\u201d while others are not. In fact, hate speech is protected by the First Amendment, because hate speech laws can be abused by governments to suppress critics. As commentators keep pointing out, Twitter is less the \u201ctown square\u201d for unfettered self-expression that Musk idealizes and more like a shop, with an obligation to maintain order.  Musk appears so comfortable contradicting himself that it\u2019s difficult to tell how much of what he says is deliberate prevarication and how much is just ignorance. Much as Trump was content to dismiss the advice of experienced colleagues when he was president, Elon Musk seems to have decided he has a better grasp on the vagaries of social media and content moderation than everyone who has run a platform before him. His statements on how he\u2019ll run Twitter constantly betray a blindness to how complicated that will actually be, and a Trumpian assurance that he must know best. Like Trump, Musk hasn\u2019t let his own checkered record or lack of insight get in the way of casting himself as the figurehead for a cause \u2013 and because, like Trump, he commands an enormous and attentive audience, he\u2019s been extremely successful. His willingness to overlook or disregard facts in the pursuit of his ambitions bears a sinister resemblance to Trump, as does his flair for repeating himself ad nauseam until people accept his statements as fact. If we learned anything from Trump\u2019s time in the spotlight, it was that he should never have been allowed it in the first place. Again and again, he highlighted design flaws in systems both state and private that should have better protected the public \u2013 whether by lying to his millions of followers on Twitter, or appointing judges to buffer his position in government. Elon Musk\u2019s crusade in the name of \u201cfree speech\u201d is already exploiting the same weaknesses. There\u2019s no controlling for shameless, intransigent men, but there urgently need to be more dependable limits over their influence. Musk shouldn\u2019t run Twitter like the Wild West, but as the law stands, he can.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. With the Supreme Court looking like it\u2019s ready to overturn Roe v. Wade, the anti-abortion movement is emboldened. And it\u2019s coming for more than just one legal victory. Republican leaders have much more than Roe in their sights, but they are desperately trying to downplay that fact. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told USA Today a federal abortion ban was \u201cpossible.\u201d But he walked those remarks back on Tuesday, saying the \u201csentiment\u201d on Capitol Hill is abortion is an \u201cissue to be dealt with at the state level \u2013 if we are, in fact, confronted with a final Supreme Court decision that throws this decision back into democratic processes.\u201d A federal abortion ban is a political impossibility at this moment, given there is a Democratic President in office. But the political landscape may not be impossible forever: Midterms are looming; there\u2019s a presidential election in two years; and Republican-led states are going so wild with abortion restrictions that they\u2019re radically redefining what\u2019s possible when it comes to constraining reproductive rights. Over and over again, feminists have been told we\u2019re abortion Chicken Littles who should calm down because our warnings about Roe\u2019s demise were hysterical. Now, the Supreme Court is poised to overturn Roe and set into motion a domino effect of draconian restrictions and ever-greater encroachments on sexual privacy and women\u2019s freedoms that line up pretty squarely with what feminists were saying all along. So, you\u2019ll excuse us if we\u2019re not exactly buying what Mitch McConnell is selling. And even if McConnell is now walking back his statement to say a federal ban isn\u2019t on the table, that\u2019s not the sentiment of much of his party, nor does it reflect the thinking of the anti-abortion movement more broadly. As conservative state legislators scramble to pen and pass extreme abortions laws that will go in effect the moment Roe is overturned \u2013 including several with no exceptions for rape victims and at least one that treats women who end pregnancies as murderers \u2013 some of McConnell\u2019s own colleagues are not content leaving this issue to the states \u2013 they\u2019re busy drafting national legislation. According to reporting in the Washington Post, Sen. Joni Ernst is prepared to introduce a bill that would outlaw abortion six weeks after a woman\u2019s last menstrual period \u2013 before most women know they\u2019re pregnant. And more than 100 House Republicans have already signed onto the Life at Conception Act, which extends equal protection under the 14th Amendment to a fertilized egg beginning at \u201cthe moment of fertilization or cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being.\u201d This strategy of restricting abortion at the state and federal levels has long been the plan. And for the religious right and their political representatives in the GOP, it\u2019s also part of a larger vision of society \u2013 one that keeps White men at the top of the hierarchy. After White evangelical leaders realized enforcing racial segregation was a losing issue, they switched to abortion in the late 1970s. But while overturning Roe v. Wade \u2013 the 1973 case that legalized abortion nationwide \u2013 has long been a goal of the religious right, it has never been the endgame. Leaders of the anti-abortion movement have been clear in their aims: They want to outlaw abortion nationwide with virtually no exceptions, including rape, incest or fetal abnormality. Some prominent anti-abortion activists and organizations go so far as to claim (quite falsely) that abortion is never necessary to save a woman\u2019s life, and so exceptions for a pregnant woman\u2019s life or health aren\u2019t necessary, either. The flat-out lies and the bad science don\u2019t stop there. \u201cLife begins at conception\u201d laws have vast consequences. There is, first and foremost, the fact that up to half of fertilized eggs don\u2019t implant, and there\u2019s no real way to know exactly when implantation happens. (This is one reason why pregnancy is counted from a person\u2019s last menstrual period and why it\u2019s defined as occurring at implantation, not fertilization). Gillibrand: Women are 'half-citizens' under draft Roe ruling Secondly, by redefining pregnancy as beginning at conception, the anti-abortion movement is sneakily trying to ban many common forms of contraception they say interrupt implantation of a fertilized egg. The medical consensus is the contraceptives most often targeted by the anti-abortion movement \u2013 emergency contraception and the IUD \u2013 work by preventing fertilization, not implantation. And other aspects of family planning could be affected as well: According to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights group, any law promulgating that life begins at the moment of fertilization would create a legal morass for parents planning to use IVF or other reproductive technology to conceive. But none of that matters to many anti-abortion activists. Some of the biggest players in the movement, including Americans United for Life, which writes the model legislation for the anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws sweeping the US, claim the IUD is a \u201clife-ending device.\u201d Other prominent anti-abortion groups argue even the birth control pill is tantamount to abortion. And conservatives \u2013 including those sitting on the Supreme Court \u2013 have been clear: It\u2019s not just Roe that\u2019s under threat but the entire line of cases decided under the longstanding view that the constitution includes a right to privacy. The first case to formally recognize that right was Griswold v. Connecticut in 1965, the case that legalized contraception for married couples. Those in the anti-abortion movement doesn\u2019t just want to overturn Roe; they want an end to the recognition of a constitutional privacy right, which would mean overturning Griswold and throwing cases that have protected consensual sex among adults and same-sex marriage into question. The to-do list of the anti-abortion movement is long, and it extends far beyond abortion. The question now is how quickly it\u2019ll move and how aggressively. As I\u2019ve noted, a federal ban is a nonstarter as long as a Democrat is in the White House, but the anti-abortion movement and its extremist enablers in the Republican Party have eyes on winning a congressional majority in the 2022 midterm elections and the presidency in 2024. There would still be hurdles to overcome, chief among them the 60-vote majority needed to override a filibuster in the Senate. Would banning abortion nationwide be tempting enough for Republicans to finagle an abortion-specific filibuster carve-out that would lower the vote threshold to 50? McConnell, for now, says no: \u201cThere are no issues which Senate Republicans believe should be exempt from the 60-vote threshold. In other words, there\u2019s zero sentiment in the Republican Conference in the Senate to get rid of the filibuster,\u201d he told reporters. The question is whether anyone believes him. McConnell isn\u2019t exactly trustworthy: Remember his appeals to fairness and consistency when he blocked Barack Obama from appointing a Supreme Court justice during Obama\u2019s last year in office? Those went out the window as soon as Donald Trump had the chance to appoint a judge in his last year. His appointment of Amy Coney Barrett to fill Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s seat is exactly why we may be about to see Roe overturned. McConnell is not motivated by fairness, consistency or honesty; he\u2019s motivated by power, and there\u2019s no reason to believe he won\u2019t wield it against abortion rights. Democrats need to be a bulwark against Republican extremism. This year\u2019s midterms are incredibly important, as is the presidential election in two years. But consistently shoring up emergency support to keep abortion somewhat legal for at least some women in the United States is not sustainable. If the Supreme Court does move forward with overturning Roe, this is what\u2019s coming: a country even further polarized and badly cleaved, with women\u2019s lives, well-being and futures in peril. Expect more vicious fights, not just over abortion but also over contraception, marriage and consensual sex.  Despite a majority of Americans saying they want abortion to be legal, contraception available and marriage open to whichever consenting adults want to marry each other, we\u2019re headed instead into a period of misogynist and reactionary minority rule. Overturning Roe is just the beginning.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joshua Prager is a former senior writer for The Wall Street Journal and the author of \u201cThe Echoing Green\u201d and, with Milton Glaser, \u201c100 Years.\u201d His newest book, a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, is \u201cThe Family Roe: An American Story.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. Should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade, as a recent leaked draft opinion indicates it will, it will fall to all 50 states to determine for themselves whether or not to legalize abortion. The general contours of how most will decide is known, and one thing is certain. As the headline of a study by the Center for American Progress put it: \u201cWomen of Color Will Lose the Most if Roe v. Wade is Overturned.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern that women of color would not have access to abortion,\u201d Harriet Washington, author of the book \u201cMedical Apartheid,\u201d told me. \u201cTheir rights regarding reproductive health,\u201d she said, \u201chave always been assailed whether by law or by custom.\u201d That illegalizing abortion will deepen racial inequities is an uncomfortable reality for those who propose doing so. It is no surprise then that, in the run-up to the upcoming Supreme Court decision on abortion, leading pro-life organizations have testified to their own diversity. Those testimonies invariably invoke the same woman: Mildred Fay Jefferson, a pro-life leader and the first Black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School. In the last few months, the National Right to Life Committee honored her, the head of the Susan B. Anthony List wrote of her in an opinion piece and Americans United for Life published a guide to pro-life legislation under an imprint it named for her: Mildred Press. That Jefferson remains, more than a decade after her 2010 death, a pro-life hero is no surprise. A Black Methodist woman, she embodied the aspirations of a movement that, upon her election in 1975 as president of the National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), was composed almost entirely of White Catholic men. The memo that saved abortion rights in America Jefferson used her perch to mold that movement into a political power that Republicanized opposition to abortion; in response to pressure exerted by the NRLC in the run-up to 1976 presidential election, the GOP, for the first time, addressed abortion in its platform. Four years later, the party elected as president someone Jefferson herself had talked into the pro-life fold. As Ronald Reagan, who as governor of California had supported legal abortion, wrote to Jefferson after seeing her on a 1973 TV program: \u201cYou made it irrefutably clear that an abortion is the taking of human life.\u201d Jefferson opposed all abortions. In an article for \u201cEbony,\u201d she wrote, \u201cYou can\u2019t give the individual the private right to kill, no matter what kind of justification they can come up with.\u201d In this, she was less in step with her contemporaries than many of the pro-life leaders of today. She also expressed contempt not only for doctors who provide abortions, but women who have them. \u201cThe woman who arranges her life haphazardly, relying on abortion to remove complications,\u201d she wrote months before Roe, \u201cis unworthy of being called woman.\u201d Jefferson, though, was living a life out of step with her words. And the pro-life movement that claims her today knows almost nothing about her. Jefferson\u2019s story is remarkable. Born in 1927, the only child of a schoolteacher and pastor, she left segregated Texas and became, at age 24, the first Black woman to graduate from Harvard Medical School. She was 43 in 1970 when she left medicine to fight abortion. A month before the Roe ruling, an appearance on a PBS program called \u201cThe Advocates\u201d made her a pro-life star. \u201cI wish I could have heard your views before our legislation was passed,\u201d Ronald Reagan, the governor of California, wrote her on January 17, 1973, referencing a bill he had signed which made abortion legal through the 20th week of pregnancy. Two years later, Jefferson became president of the National Right to Life Committee, using her perch to transform abortion into political capital that she then helped the Republican party turn into legislation and votes. More, she was helping to grow the pro-life base beyond white Catholic men. \u201cYou know what the best strategy for the pro-life movement would be?\u201d Henry Hyde, a Republican congressman (whose name is synonymous with a federal ban on using Medicaid funds to cover abortion), would tell a pro-life lobbyist. \u201cSomeone ought to pay Dr. Mildred Jefferson just to travel around the country and speak out on behalf of the unborn.\u201d Indeed, Jefferson inspired the movement; she famously wrote that the right to life was not merely for \u201cthe perfect, the privileged and the planned.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t conviction alone that redirected Jefferson from medicine to the fight against abortion. It was prejudice as well. Not until 1968 \u2013 17 years after Jefferson graduated Harvard Medical School \u2013 would the American Board of Surgery certify a Black woman, Hughenna Gauntlett. And when, in 1951, Jefferson began her surgical residency at Boston City Hospital, her supervisor, a surgeon named A.J.A. Campbell, told her \u201cshe would run into problems\u2026 because she was a black female and this may be resented by some of the doctors and nurses.\u201d Twenty-one years would pass before Jefferson (who had completed the equivalent of three surgical residencies) was at last, in 1972, granted certification. By then, she had begun to fight abortion; in 1970, she co-founded a pro-life organization in Massachusetts. But she still hoped to realize her lifelong dream of becoming a surgeon, and repeatedly asked the chairman of surgery at her hospital, Richard Egdahl, to refer her patients. Egdahl later acknowledged that he \u201crefused to do so\u201d even though he knew \u201cnothing of a derogatory nature concerning her.\u201d Devastated, Jefferson left medicine for good. She never spoke publicly of what drove her from medicine, and continued for decades to tell any and all that she remained a practicing surgeon. Jefferson had experienced racism all her life. The great-granddaughter of slaves (as her cousin told me in an interview), she had had to sit, as a child of five in Texas, in the balcony of the local theater when in 1932 \u201cLittle Orphan Annie: came to town. And when, a quarter-century later, on her 30th birthday in 1957, she met a man at a ski lodge in New Hampshire, she was unsure what to do. She came to love him, and wished to marry him. But the man, a sailor named Shane Cunningham, was White. And while interracial marriage was legal in Massachusetts where she lived, \u201cmiscegenation\u201d remained a felony in half of the 48 states. Her life was already difficult; her career was stuck, she struggled with increasing debts and hoarding too. Five years passed before Jefferson finally assented in 1962 to marry the man she loved \u2013 but on one condition. Jefferson had long spoken of the power of self-determination. Achievement, she told the press after graduating from Harvard, was simply \u201ca willing of the right thing to happen.\u201d But, she had come see that determination took one only so far. She had come to believe, as she now told Cunningham, and as he later told me, that to live was to be subject to discrimination, hypocrisy, \u201cextreme unfairness.\u201d She thus resolved, she told Cunningham, to never conceive a child. Cunningham married her with a heavy heart. Jefferson, he told me, \u201cwould have been a wonderful mother.\u201d  Jefferson\u2019s decision to not have a child was remarkable for two reasons. First, she believed that propagation was the very purpose of woman \u2013 \u201cthe essence and reasons we exist as female human beings,\u201d she later told the historian Jennifer Donnally. Second, her belief that life itself was unjust was at odds with everything she publicly stood for \u2013 beginning with the absolute proscription of abortion. It is no surprise that, as the pro-life leader Judie Brown told me, Jefferson lied as to the reason why she had no children, telling friends that she was unable to conceive. Jefferson\u2019s fight against Roe \u2013 and her hoarding, too \u2013 left little figurative or actual room for a husband. Cunningham left their home eight years after they married, and the couple divorced eight years after that. Jefferson lived the last decades of her life alone, sustained by a small pro-life non-profit in Tulsa. Having sworn off traditional medicine \u2013 doctor checkups and hospitalizations \u2013 she died at home in a swell of her papers. Judie Brown eulogized Jefferson as \u201cthe architect of the anti-abortion movement.\u201d The doctor had also experienced extreme racism and misogyny, and within that divide lay the disconnect between what she said in public and what she did in private. That disconnect makes Jefferson an imperfect symbol for opponents of abortion. But it also makes her an honest one. For as Angela Davis observed, women of color who have abortions speak less of a want to end their pregnancies than \u201cabout the miserable social conditions which dissuade them from bringing new lives into the world.\u201d",

View more opinion articles on CNN. A Harvard University report casts new light on how slavery helped forge one of America\u2019s most prestigious universities \u2013 and offers some hope for a path toward repairing the deep wounds from the peculiar institution that remain today. At a moment when dozens of states have passed bills making it illegal for public schools to learn, teach or discuss the deep history of slavery and racial injustice in America, the Harvard report stands out as a breath of fresh air in a vast ocean of intolerance, fear and falsehoods. Appropriately titled  \u201cHarvard & the Legacy of Slavery\u201d the 134-page document illustrates the depth and breadth of slavery in the making of the university. Written by a committee of prestigious scholars and chaired by the renowned historian, legal scholar and Dean of the Radcliffe Institute Tomiko Brown-Nagin, the report\u2019s findings have been accepted by Harvard president Larry Bacow, and he released a letter on behalf of the school\u2019s leadership outlining its commitment of $100 million dedicated to rectifying past wrongs tied to the university\u2019s immoral but economically profitable relationship to slavery. The report calls for the money to be used in multiple ways: to create monuments and memorials to the enslaved people who once worked at Harvard; to implement a curriculum that can convey this history to students, scholars and the wider public; to start an exchange program between students at Harvard and Historically Black Colleges and Universities and to build partnerships to uplift schools in the Caribbean and the American South. Those latter locations matter \u2013 both acknowledge the origins of the profits made by White elites at Harvard (and elsewhere),  extracted from the lives and labor of Black people then defined as a species of property. Part of the endowment will be used to assist tribal colleges and to trace the lineage of the more than 70 enslaved Black people owned by slavers with deep and intimate ties to past Harvard presidents and affiliated clergy and politicians. The myths about slavery that still hold America captive \u201cThe university is committed to deeply meaningful and sustained remedies that will endure in perpetuity,\u201d Brown-Nagin told the New York Times.  The report does not mention reparations, and in the same interview with the Times, Brown-Nagin observed of \u201creparations\u201d that it \u201cmeans different things to different people, so fixating on that term, I think, can be counterproductive,\u201d The promised endowment\u2019s proposed remedies, when implemented, will arrive too late for some descendants of enslaved Black folk at Harvard who have lived and toiled in Boston \u2013 many of them unaware of their connection to the era when this august institution fattened its coffers with wealth created from the human wreckage of subjugated Black people. Despite the news flash earned by its $100 million price tag, the historical and contemporary context for Harvard\u2019s report is far more crucial in the short term than the potential impact for actions that have not yet taken place. Harvard\u2019s report comes 16 years after Brown University, under the leadership of the first Black president of an Ivy League university, the legendary Ruth Simmons (who then went on to lead historically Black Prairie View A&M University), published a similar report that ignited a reckoning with slavery at elite schools. Brown\u2019s actions proved generative, with more than 80 universities in North America and Europe conducting their own investigations into their past relationship with slavery. Georgetown\u2019s own recently documented history of the Jesuit institution\u2019s relationship with slavery inspired the creation of a similar endowment that has offered scholarships for some of the descendants of enslaved people owned by the university to attend the school for free. We redefined Blackness as a world and a gift As important and groundbreaking as the Brown report and subsequent investigations are, Harvard\u2019s arguably carries more meaning in 2022 due to the institution\u2019s global influence and the crucial timing of this report\u2019s release. Since 2020 at least 35 states have passed or considered passing legislation designed to ban the teaching of racial injustice in America\u2019s public schools. The teaching of America\u2019s long history of structural and institutional racism against Black, Indigenous, LatinX, Asian American and Pacific Islanders and other groups has been labeled as \u201cCritical Race Theory,\u201d a phrase that has become a leading signifier in the nation\u2019s new cultural war. The assaults against the teaching of the unsavory parts of American history, or indeed in some cases of mentioning them at all, are growing in scope and momentum as this election year heats up. Many of those attacks are rooted in conservative anxiety and intent to demonize the New York Times\u2019 \u201c1619 Project,\u201d a multimedia investigation of slavery and democracy edited by the journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones. Derrick Bell, one of the founders of Critical Race Theory as a school of academic legal analysis, and the first Black tenured law professor at Harvard Law School, died in 2011. But if he were here, he would perhaps not be surprised by the way in which conservatives have disfigured CRT as a political instrument to deny Black citizenship and dignity. This Georgia county is one of many Black communities erased by White mob violence A civil rights lawyer turned law professor, Bell\u2019s work continues to shape generations of Black and multiracial scholars interested in the relationship between race and law in America. Bell\u2019s bestselling 1992 book, \u201cFaces at the Bottom of the Well: The Permanence of Racism\u201d presciently anticipated White political backlash, of the kind that fueled both the rise of President Donald Trump and the successful passage of so-called anti-CRT bills so extreme that they seek to avoid or deny historical truth to protect students\u2019 feelings and regulate how employers can talk about race at work. The Harvard report comes then at a pivotal moment in American history, one where the nation seems poised to either erase or replay some of the grimmest parts of its past or forge ahead by taking bold steps to build a new world by sharing a new story about ourselves. Instructively, the report documents the historic ties \u2013 intellectual, financial and direct \u2013 between Harvard and slavery as an institution that created profit and leisure time, added personal value and offered direct benefits to generations of Harvard students, faculty, staff, alumni, trustees and affiliates without ever acknowledging Black pain and suffering or the invaluable contribution African Americans made to the university. Harvard not only used enslaved people\u2019s labor during the 17th century, but received a third of its financial resources during the first half of the 19th century from a handful of wealthy donors whose fortunes rested on \u201cslavery and slave produced commodities.\u201d This is heavy stuff. What one man's life and death can teach us about the fight for the Black vote The most poignant parts of the report, the ones that made me cry, come toward the end. The first appendix lists the more than 70 human beings enslaved by Harvard Presidents, Fellows, Overseers, Faculty, Staff and Major Donors.  The anguish that I felt reading these names and parts of their stories was magnified as I pondered the gaps in the narrative, the information we don\u2019t have about them. I ache for that knowledge, even as I understood this would cause me (and others) more pain. The bits of biography surrounding the enslaved woman Dinah, who worked in the extended household of Harvard President Edward Holyoke during the 18th century, is particularly heart-wrenching. Her initial entree into this history is through a recording of her weight as a 51-pound child. A dozen years later she reappears as a household servant cleaning one of the familial homes of the Holyoke clan. Dinah\u2019s ultimate fate remains unclear, she may have left her position of servitude with the end of slavery in Massachusetts in 1780, but a more definitive answer is still elusive.  Still, the relentless optimist in me sees this report as an opportunity to have a thoughtful, mature and necessary push toward national reparations for racial slavery. The candor of Harvard\u2019s report, the institution\u2019s pledge of $100 million endowment to remedy past wrongs and the diligence of the committee members and President Bacow in getting this right offer a model for a more thoughtful, invigorating and impactful confrontations of slavery\u2019s legacy in other parts of our country. I hope every schoolteacher in America takes the time to read the report and shares it with at least one student and friend. Parents, school boards, churches, synagogues and mosques should do likewise. Harvard has, in its own small and significant way, with its willingness to face the most unseemly and dishonorable parts of its past, taken meaningful steps toward a path of healing. We can only build a new story of America \u2013 our past, present, and future \u2013 by confronting how we arrived at this moment together.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. The most urgent policy change needed to help dismantle racism in 2022 and going forward is ending the largely unchecked voter suppression that has targeted Black and low-income voters since the 2013 Shelby v. Holder Supreme Court decision gutted section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which expressly prevented states from enacting punitive voting laws that disproportionately disenfranchise historically marginalized groups. That\u2019s the message of the latest \u201cState of Black America\u201d report from the National Urban League, an annual assessment of the progress and challenges of securing Black citizenship and dignity. The title of this year\u2019s edition, \u201cUnder Siege: The Plot to Destroy Democracy,\u201d reflects its sobering \u2013 and accurate \u2013 portrait of the health of American democracy. The report found that Black Americans, according to an \u201cEquality Index\u201d that reveals disparities for Black Americans relative to Whites in economic opportunity, education, health, social justice and civic engagement, received a score of 73.9% \u2013 up 0.2 % from a year ago but well short of the 100% goal of a nation where racial equality is the norm. \u201cThe Equality Index is an aggregate analysis of centuries of structural racism that can be a starting point to crafting policy to dismantle anti-Black racism in America,\u201d the report\u2019s authors observed. \u201cUnder Siege\u201d outlines the four tools being weaponized against Black voters: gerrymandering, voter suppression, election sabotage and intimidation. Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing congressional district lines for partisan advantage. In states like Texas and North Carolina this has meant that Republicans have been able to decrease Black congressional representation through gerrymandering despite an increase in the overall population of people of color. The GOP-controlled Florida legislature this week adopted Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019s proposed congressional map that would add four seats likely to go to Republicans, do away with districts now represented by two of the state\u2019s Black US House members and potentially prompt a federal court challenge to the Voting Rights Act. What Desantis' proposed congressional map of Florida could mean According to the report, last year 19 states passed 34 voter suppression bills making it harder to vote, policies that hamper Black representation already dwindling because of gerrymandering. In 2022, 18 states have pursued 152 voter restriction bills. The bulk of these bills enforce strict voter ID laws, purge voter rolls, reduce access to mail-in ballots, eliminate providing water and snacks to voters waiting in long lines, limit early voting and make the entire process more difficult. Election sabotage \u2013 efforts to discredit legitimate votes or empower partisan officials to reject or overturn votes \u2013 has since 2020 been fueled at the national level by former President Donald Trump and his allies promulgating the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d falsehood, and those attempts have seeped into state and local election bureaucracy. Multiple states have introduced legislation that would allow elected officials to disregard the will of voters and authorize undemocratic results based on their party affiliation. Successful campaigns to sow doubt about election security have placed local elected officials, often volunteers performing their civic duty, under undue pressure and \u2013 as the report details, many have experienced threats of violence and worse. City clerks brace for attacks ahead of 2022 midterm elections Fully understanding the report\u2019s findings requires historical context, because we have been here before. Much of the contemporary GOP voter suppression efforts echo the actions of the Reconstruction-era Democratic Party, which used voter intimidation, fraud, conspiracy theories and naked violence to marginalize increasing majorities of Black voters in the decades immediately after the end of racial slavery in 1865. By the early 20th century, virtually no Black elected officials represented the South at the federal level, and local politics shut them out completely. For almost a century, Black people lived under one-party rule in the South, a pattern that threatens to be repeated in perpetuity if the current situation continues. The National Urban League\u2019s \u201cState of Black America\u201d is, at its core, a warning of the perils of failing to address the steady erosion of democratic norms in America. Even after the departure of Donald Trump, this trend imperils the future of liberalism, democracy and capitalism \u2013 at home and around the world. The bitter resistance to multi-racial democracy The open commitment among some in the GOP to anti-democratic authoritarianism (and the sympathy or silence on the matter by other Republicans), which many hoped might end after Trump was voted out of office, continues to flourish. Just witness the unwillingness by conservative media outlets to criticize Putin in the weeks leading up to the Russian invasion. The longtime flirting with autocratic strongmen leaders in Hungary, Brazil and Russia by conservatives is more than just a troubling sign of the times. It betrays the fundamental precepts of a liberal democracy. The Putin Wing of the Republican Party is a crisis in the making, with devastating possible consequences around the world. The political drift that has found some conservatives expressing sympathy for authoritarians such as Putin and Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban has added to the growing crisis of relevancy facing liberal democracy on the world stage. But it does not have to be this way. America can still be a beacon for liberal democracy at home and abroad by seeking to fundamentally protect the right to vote of all Americans. Black folks have always been the canary in the coal mine in this nation. During times of war and economic depression, the hardships and miseries confront those most vulnerable first. Black America remains, as the Urban League report demonstrates, more likely to suffer lack of access to health care, high quality schools and good jobs.  Martin Luther King Jr. characterized the nation\u2019s belief in freedom as \u201cgreat wells of democracy\u201d first dug by founders and successively deepened and expanded upon generationally. We face a similar fight to the one King successfully waged with the help of President Lyndon Johnson and millions of ordinary citizens at home and around the world. How are we to claim to be the world\u2019s more important and enduring democracy around the world and yet fail to safeguard the sacred right to vote for our citizens at home? We can start by choosing country over party and passing the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The chance of this legislation passing in the near term depends less on the outcome of this year\u2019s midterms (where Democrats are expected to lose their majority in the House of Representatives) and more likely on the 2024 election. Democrats should remind voters at every opportunity of what is at stake on the ballot during the upcoming midterms. Republicans who are good faith political actors (in contrast to bad faith political actors who celebrate the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday while refusing to support voting rights) should join together with Democrats to pursue a halt to voter suppression. That toxic political weapon, although used most against the Black community as shown by the Urban League\u2019s report, in reality threatens to upend the entire fabric of the freedoms long enjoyed by so many and earned by the generations of sacrifice Americans celebrate to this day. The best way to honor the heroes of past American movements for social justice in our lifetime is to restore and expand voting rights for all people.",

In the first days of Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s US Senate confirmation hearings as the nominee to become the first Black woman associate justice on the US Supreme Court, it\u2019s becoming clearer how long a journey it\u2019s been to get to this moment \u2013 and the road that still remains to be traveled. Tennessee Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn\u2019s final opening remarks Monday revealed the scope of what Jackson\u2019s up against. Blackburn\u2019s inaccurate and blatantly racist attempts to patronize Jackson while twisting her sterling record into a scare narrative of GOP bogeymen \u2013 critical race theory, the 1619 Project and controversies over transgender athletes and women\u2019s sports \u2013 were staggering yet unsurprising. Despite highly visible efforts by Republicans on the committee to discredit, humiliate and smear Jackson, it is well worth remembering why her story matters to so many people. Her origin story as a young Black girl who excelled at some of the best schools in America,  served early in her professional career as a public defender, went on to clerk for Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer before rising to become a US District Judge and to be confirmed to the US Court of Appeals, is an example of the best part of this nation\u2019s promise. Her story is one that embodies the best of America. The juxtaposition between Democratic and Republican senators\u2019 questions for Jackson Tuesday, the second day of the proceedings, illustrated the toxic and growing partisan gulf that has transformed American politics from a noble calling to public service into a blood sport.  Texas Sen. Ted Cruz offered unintentional comic relief when he asked Jackson to opine about a book promoting anti-racism for infants and young children that he said \u201cis being taught at Georgetown Day School to students in pre-K through second grade.\u201d Cruz accused the Washington, DC, school, where Jackson is on the board of trustees, of supporting critical race theory and demanded that she respond. Her pause 'really said it all': Abby Phillip breaks down Cruz-Jackson exchange \u201cDo you agree with this book being taught to kids that babies are racist?\u201d The nominee, after a pause long enough to indicate apparent contempt for the question, then replied critical race theory was taught in law schools and not in K-12 public schools. She also made the point that Georgetown Day School \u2013 like the school where Justice Amy Coney Barrett sat on the board before her confirmation \u2013 is a private school. Cruz at one point held up the book in question as a kind of vulgar prop (while sitting in front of an enlarged reproduction of one of its pages) \u2013 essentially ending the GOP\u2019s promise that Jackson\u2019s confirmation hearings would not devolve into some kind of circus. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Missouri\u2019s Josh Hawley, two of the most conservative and Trump-loving elected officials in the nation, attempted to attack Jackson as being soft on crime and unusually lenient in sentencing child sex offenders (an assertion that a group of retired federal judges rejected, finding her sentences \u201centirely consistent\u201d with that of other judges across the country). Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois, chairman of the committee, offered Jackson a chance to address Hawley\u2019s allegations as laid out in his opening statement Monday. Jackson is handing conservatives one key victory When Durbin asked Jackson what she thought when she heard Hawley\u2019s allegations, she said as a \u201cmother and a judge who has had to deal with these cases, I was thinking that nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d She then outlined the seriousness with which she takes such cases and the harsh penalties that she has imposed. The charge that Jackson sentenced child sex offenders to less time in certain cases than prosecutors recommended is particularly offensive, since it reflects a long-standing pattern in American history of attempting to pillory Black women as being incapable of living up to virtuous standards of womanhood. From the days of Sojourner Truth\u2019s 1851 \u201cAin\u2019t I a Woman\u201d speech that deplored the way in which privileges and promises of protection afforded to White women were denied their Black counterparts, Black women have struggled to have the full measure of their humanity recognized by American legal and political institutions. Anita Hill, a Black woman who accused then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment during his 1991 confirmation hearings, found herself unable to convince an overwhelmingly White and male Senate that her charges were true. It\u2019s especially galling to watch Hawley, a fierce proponent of so-called traditional (read: White, patriarchal) masculinity, seek to demean Jackson with such baseless attacks against the backdrop of this history. Ketanji Brown Jackson was a hall of famer even in my high school Cotton attacked Jackson for reducing the sentence of a convicted drug dealer, a decision Jackson made in light of the First Step Act passed in 2018 by Republican President Donald J. Trump. \u201cYou chose to rewrite the law because you were sympathetic to a drug fentanyl kingpin,\u201d claimed Cotton. \u201cRespectfully, Senator. I disagree,\u201d retorted Jackson. While Republicans have focused on Jackson\u2019s \u201cjudicial philosophy,\u201d parroting support for an originalist or textualist approach to interpreting the Constitution, a document that in its original form would have denied Jackson her humanity, Democrats on the committee have also sought to place Jackson\u2019s nomination in the long and tumultuous sweep of America\u2019s racial history in more positive ways. Jackson is poised to change the history of a nation where before the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act (legislation whose aims have been notably under threat by Republicans since the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 Shelby v. Holder decision), she could have scarcely voted, let alone been considered to sit on the nation\u2019s highest court. As her parents watched with pride, she answered a question from Sen. Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, regarding the historic nature of her nomination. \u201cI believe that the Constitution is fixed in its meaning,\u201d Jackson asserted.\u201dI believe that it\u2019s appropriate to look at the original intent, the original public meaning of the words when one is trying to assess, because, again, that\u2019s a limitation on my authority to import my own policy views,\u201d Jackson said in reply to Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse\u2019s question about her views on the Constitution and judicial interpretation. 'You don't have to be perfect': Watch Judge Jackson's emotional message to her girls \u201cToday we should rejoice,\u201d observed Booker in his opening statement on the first day of hearings. He placed Jackson\u2019s rise to the precipice of history within the moral arc of the nation\u2019s political imagination on its long journey from slavery and Jim Crow racial segregation, to the election of a Black President, Vice President, and the first Black woman to sit on the Supreme Court. On day two, Booker followed Cotton and gave Jackson an opportunity to discuss the challenges of work-life balance as the mother of two daughters with an exceptionally busy career. Jackson appeared visibly moved discussing her own at times imperfect efforts to juggle \u201chearings during your daughters\u2019 recitals\u201d and \u201cemergencies on birthdays that you have to handle.\u201d In this sense, like former First Lady Michelle Obama, Jackson is a brilliant Black working mother whose love for the law and public service is matched by her love for her family and children. As a Black woman, navigating these multiple roles \u2013 as mother, judge and wife \u2013 can be more perilous than White counterparts since African American women are still too often belittled and patronized in our society. This lack of grace and empathy was evident in some of the jaw-dropping language used by members of the committee to describe Jackson \u2013 for instance, Sasse told Jackson she was \u201cincredibly likable and winsome.\u201d It seems impossible to imagine the Senator - or others of his colleagues, who praised Jackson\u2019s performance in a similarly gendered terms - speaking these words to a White, male nominee. It sounded for all the world like she was being congratulated for not being an Angry Black Woman.  Black women have, historically, worked tirelessly to transform American democracy and the political institutions that have failed to recognize their humanity, brilliance and power. Since the end of slavery, the quest for citizenship and dignity has proved a particularly difficult one for Black women who \u2013 denied voting rights on both the basis of their race and their gender \u2013 occupied a political and social limbo. Mistreated by White institutions that saw them less as women than Black and, at times, disrespected in Black communities because they were women, they persisted in keeping Black families afloat and dreams of dignity alive. The political mudslinging, much of it racist and sexist, being hurled during these confirmation hearings will at best delay \u2013 but cannot deny \u2013 the inevitable. She will almost certainly be confirmed along partisan lines as the first Black woman on the United States Supreme Court. She stands on the shoulders of giants. They include Black women such as Constance Baker Motley, invoked by Jackson as an inspiration (they share a birthday), who was appointed the first Black female federal judge by President Lyndon Baines Johnson in 1966. Her confirmation will come four years short of the nation\u2019s 250th anniversary. It will represent a long-overdue recognition of the value of Black women in service of social justice and reflect the power of the American Dream when leveraged in search of the larger purpose and promise of American democracy.",

As the district line curves around four Alabama counties \u2013 Macon, Elmore, Montgomery and Bullock \u2013 it resembles a tribute to Alfred E. Neuman\u2019s protuberant craggy ears. To one side sits Alabama\u2019s second congressional district and the overwhelmingly White towns of Elmore County, home to tourist fantasias like Wetumpka, where Southern Living recently admired the art galleries and microbreweries, and quieter rural spots dotted with Jesus 2020 signs, where the only downtown might be multiple Baptist churches. On the other side sits the state\u2019s third congressional district, which includes Macon County, an area that is more than 80% Black. Here, the poverty rate is double that of Elmore County, while household incomes are almost 50% less. Southern Living did not visit Macon\u2019s Shorter, where a rundown and long-troubled greyhound track and slot machine emporium is the closest thing to economic development. Earlier this month, just hours after the US Supreme Court restored a congressional map that a lower federal court had ordered redrawn because it diluted Black voting power, I set out to drive many of these district lines that surgically divide Alabama by race. What I found was startling but not surprising: These lines neatly trace, and perpetuate, Alabama\u2019s history of racial injustice, dividing \u2013 for example \u2013 the Montgomery of Rosa Parks from the city\u2019s tony, country club enclaves. Extreme gerrymandering and racial discrimination have long gone hand in hand, but the current redistricting cycle has turbocharged representational inequality in many states, largely those controlled by Republicans, but sometimes in Democratic states \u2013 even as minority population booms and White population numbers stagnate. In late January, a Washington Post study of the 28 states that had then completed redistricting found that eight new majority-White congressional districts had been drawn this cycle while the number of majority-Black districts had been cut in half. Population growth, especially across the South, has been driven almost entirely by communities of color. Political power, however, has not followed. In states like Georgia and Louisiana, Blacks make up about one-third of the population \u2013 but are crowded into far fewer congressional districts. Instead, growing Black and Latino neighborhoods have been sliced and diced \u2013 sometimes cleverly, other times quite crudely, but always with the same result: Pushing the horizon for multiracial democracy yet another decade down the road. Part of this is desperation and opportunism: Only five seats separate Democrats and Republicans in the US House of Representatives, so each side has aggressively redrawn maps this cycle both to fortify their seats and make gains wherever they can. This is bad for democracy, and driven the number of competitive seats to discouraging modern lows. In part, this is the dreary legacy of two earlier US Supreme Court rulings. This is the first redistricting cycle since 2013\u2019s Shelby County v Holder, where a 5-4 Court disabled the \u201cpre-clearance\u201d protections within section five of the Voting Rights Act. As a result, states with a history of racial discrimination in electoral practices, no longer need Department of Justice approval for their maps. If voters don't stop it, election deniers could kill American democracy Then, in 2019, a 5-4 Court shuttered the federal courts to partisan gerrymandering claims. While racial gerrymandering remained illegal, the decision created a loophole that made it easier to get away with: Lawmakers could draw maps that harmed communities of color while simply claiming their goal was allowable partisan advantage rather than racial discrimination. It is the latest, sadly predictable chapter for a nation that\u2019s becoming more diverse every year, but regularly rejects multiracial democracy \u2013 whether with violence, intimidation and Jim Crow laws in previous decades or via technical legal decisions and precision gerrymandering now. There has always been a scheme. Nowhere are these tactics and trends more visible than in aforementioned Alabama. The state grew by 6.3% over the last decade, according to the 2020 census. But, as in many other states, the White population decreased, while Black and Latino numbers grew. Alabama is nearly 27% Black and has seven congressional seats, which could easily correspond to two minority opportunity districts in a state with a history of racially polarized voting (indeed, plaintiffs challenging the Alabama maps offered multiple approaches). But that\u2019s not how Republican lawmakers drew the lines. Indeed, if \u201ccracking\u201d and \u201cpacking\u201d are gerrymandering\u2019s key weapons, the GOP wielded them with surgical precision to ensure it carries six of the seven seats. Why Latinos are turning to the Republican Party Their handiwork is unmistakable on a heat map produced by the plaintiffs challenging the Alabama map. It shows the state\u2019s concentration of Black voters set against the seven congressional districts. The western \u201cBlack Belt\u201d counties are packed into the seventh district, which stretches just far enough, at its most northeastern boundary, into Birmingham to precisely gather fast-growing Black census tracts. Then, almost 100 miles away, at its most eastern boundary, you can see how the map carves out a sliver of Montgomery County. That gathers the Black neighborhoods still recovering from decades of racist redlining practices \u2013 while saving nearby wealthy, White communities like Pike Road for the second. If the seventh district is packed with more than 60% of Black voters, the Black voters living in counties just east of Montgomery have been cracked in half. The straight line just east of Montgomery bisects the Black voters in Macon (also home to Tuskegee). This county is among the largest concentration of Black voters on this side of the state. But the lines make it impossible for them to be part of electing a US House member of their choosing. They\u2019ve been gerrymandered into irrelevance: Severed from the Black Belt, whacked in half again for good measure, added to counties more than 90% White. There are similar stories nationwide \u2013 and fewer tools to stop them. The Voting Rights Act \u2013 and its subsequent reauthorizations \u2013 looked to prevent these racial gerrymanders, both by demanding preapproval of maps in states with a history of racial discrimination in election laws, and by offering protection against vote dilution nationwide. Now much of that has been washed away.  A decision out of Arkansas last week could weaken or end the ability of activists and organizations to challenge allegedly discriminatory maps and leave that decision to the federal government alone. The decision, by a federal trial judge, still subject to review by appellate courts, would require claims to be brought only by the US attorney general, and not by private plaintiffs. It would, if upheld, upend the Voting Rights Act and decades of precedent \u2013 and perhaps even nullify much of the VRA under an attorney general with a similarly narrow approach. The court\u2019s decision to reinstate the Alabama maps, meanwhile, has weakened the ability to quickly win new maps before elections are held \u2013 and could lead to a broader weakening of section two of the Voting Rights Act, which protects against the dilution of votes by racial minorities and has been used to guard against egregious racial gerrymanders. (State supreme courts, in states that have free, fair or equal elections protections in state constitutions, have been more reliable protectors, especially against gerrymandered maps. Yet each decision also tends to turn those elected bodies into even more contested partisan battlefields.) While much of the political media has concentrated on the important partisan implications of redistricting, there\u2019s much more at stake. A multiracial nation has arrived. These gerrymanders seek to submerge it before it can blossom.",

View more opinion on CNN. After four years when all eyes were glued to the presidency, American politics have taken on a decidedly local bent. During last fall\u2019s elections in Virginia, national media latched on to events in Loudoun County, where both right-wing and mainstream outlets amplified local politics and growing panic over everything from critical race theory and trans students\u2019 bathroom access to mask policies and math courses. After Republican Glenn Youngkin won the governorship, commentators dissected the results to foretell the outcome of elections in 2022, 2024 and beyond. This week\u2019s recall election in San Francisco is following a similar pattern. Three school board members lost their seats in a recall effort fueled by so many different issues that observers could easily play pick-your-own-narrative. There were extended pandemic school closures, a ham-handed effort to rename schools commemorating Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, among other figures, in the name of social justice, an attempt to move away from testing and GPA requirements for admission into high-ranking public schools, a growing achievement gap, an enormous budget deficit and, in the case of one school board member, the use of a racial slur in an anti-Asian rant. All that makes trying to sum up the lessons of the recall a tall order. But while the results in San Francisco may resist simple analysis, the politics swirling around the recall tell us something important about a process underway across the country. In San Francisco, deep-pocketed, right-leaning donors shoveled money into the recall, while activists and media outlets began using language that lashed together the disparate dissatisfactions into a coherent message. Prince Andrew proves no man can act with impunity This rhetoric of \u201cparents\u2019 rights\u201d is not new to the 2020s; conservatives in Colorado in the 1990s even sought to pass a \u201cparents\u2019 rights\u201d amendment \u201cto direct and control the upbringing, education, values and discipline of their children.\u201d Yet it is now being reworked to funnel all the discontents of the era into a set of right-wing school politics at the heart of the GOP\u2019s strategy for the coming midterm elections. Political organizing around schools is nearly as old as compulsory schooling itself, sparking battles over access, the teaching of subjects like evolution and sex and mandatory prayer and pledges of allegiance. Parents played a role on both sides of all these issues, advocating for the school rules that they felt aligned with their own values. Yet because so many of these issues would ultimately be settled in state legislatures, Congress and the courts, the right successfully framed school politics as concerned parents having their rights infringed by politicians, bureaucrats and judges. This was the case with desegregation and busing, with Black parents constantly pressing for equal access to local schools and better education. In Boston in the 1960s, Black parents organized Operation Exodus, an effort to transport their children to better schools in the years before court-ordered busing. The arrival of court-ordered busing in the 1970s, which occurred after White-run school boards failed to comply with the state\u2019s Racial Imbalance Act of 1965, led to the formation of groups like ROAR (Restore Our Alienated Rights), a movement by White parents to resist school desegregation. The chaos from Omicron might be fading, but the turbulence ahead could be worse The notion that this was a parent-led, and specifically a mother-led, movement was key to the political appeal opponents of segregation were making: that first the legislature and then the courts were forcing them to send their children to integrated schools, and that as parents they had not only a right but an obligation to act in what they saw as their children\u2019s best interest. It was an emotional narrative pitting aggrieved parents against a pitiless state \u2013 a narrative that excluded Black parents and their activism on behalf of their children. That same erasure happened in the debate over African American Vernacular English that exploded in 1996, after the Oakland school board passed a garbled resolution recognizing AAVE, or ebonics, as a language. The resolution, which was widely reported as a requirement to teach ebonics as a replacement for standard English (or \u201cteach black schoolchildren in ghetto-ese,\u201d as the Boston Globe put it), was both ridiculed and denounced by everyone from civil rights leader Jesse Jackson to conservative Education Secretary William Bennett. It was treated as a sign that public schools were incapable of properly educating students, that standards were nearing non-existence under the reign of liberal bureaucrats. San Francisco rape controversy will have a chilling effect The politics of the ebonics panic allowed no space for the broader story, one that began with the problem of poor Black students being underserved and undereducated within the school system. A lawsuit brought in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1979 on behalf of poor Black students argued that they were being denied equal access to education because the school system did not account for the socioeconomic and cultural background of these students. A judge ruled that the school had to find ways to identify students who spoke AAVE and find ways to use that knowledge to assist their education. It was in response to these concerns that the Oakland school board acted. There was some pushback at the time against the popular narrative about ebonics, and Jesse Jackson would soon retract his initial denunciation, admitting he had misunderstood the issue. The school board resolution may not have been the solution to educational disparities in Oakland. But ultimately the politics of the ebonics panic served conservative ends, not the needs of the Black students it sought to help. The ebonics panic was just one of many instances where conservatives and moderates found common ground as the right spun moral panics into backlash politics, fostering a sense that something was wrong with schools, and anyone concerned about education quality and children\u2019s well-being should be wary of public schools and progressive politics.  In places like Loudoun County and San Francisco, conservative activists are attempting to do the same today, refashioning a suite of school discontents into a wave of Republican victories. What these decades of backlash politics show is that narrative plays a powerful role in shaping where politics flow. Democratic politicians often lack courage when backlash politics are in motion, as likely to jump on the outrage bandwagon as shrink into the shadows, waiting for it to blow over. But they and progressive activists have a responsibility to counter moral panics with narratives more rooted in reality and more concerned with those whose needs are being overlooked. Journalists and commentators also play a critical role in how backlash politics form: whose stories get told and emphasized, what frames are applied to the story of what schools need and where they fail, what policy issues and political concerns are treated as legitimate and which get hand-waved away. Getting those issues right is not just critical for how elections unfold, but how schools are ultimately valued and reformed.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cI know nothing.\u201d That was the response members of the Order of the Star Spangled Banner were supposed to give when asked about their secret society, which was founded in 1849. The fiercely anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic group evolved into the American Party, but it will be forever remembered by another name. The \u201cKnow Nothings\u201d became a powerful political force, commanding the allegiance of more than 100 members of Congress in the 1850s, as Lorraine Boissoneault wrote in Smithsonian Magazine. Last week, a Republican member of Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene, lashed out at Speaker Nancy Pelosi, falsely accusing her of having \u201cgazpacho police spying on members of Congress,\u201d apparently mistaking a cold vegetable soup from Spain for the Gestapo, the Nazi regime\u2019s secret police. The botched reference was widely mocked on social media, and Greene later made fun of herself, tweeting: \u201cNo soup for those who illegally spy on Members of Congress, but they will be thrown in the goulash.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the first time Greene had reached for wildly inappropriate Nazi comparisons. Even if she had gotten the term Gestapo right, there would have been no excuse for comparing the Capitol Police with the murderous agents of Hitler\u2019s Germany. Greene\u2019s blunder came at a head-spinning moment, when hyperpartisan politics and the long-running pandemic have combined to produce a cavalcade of misinformation, disinformation, ignorance, conspiracy theories and self-defeating protests \u2013 as if knowing nothing has become a feature, not a bug of 2022. \u201cOne aspect of the pandemic experience that can\u2019t simply be explained by the existence of an exceedingly transmissible, deadly virus spreading between us is the sheer absurdity that it brought with it,\u201d wrote Abdul El-Sayed. \u201cWhether boarding an airplane with underwear on your face to protest mask requirements, injecting yourself with horse dewormer instead of a safe and effective vaccine or swallowing household disinfectants because the President of the United States unironically suggested that it might help, the pandemic has amplified the frequency and tenor of ridiculous and sometimes alarming behavior.\u201d Take the Canadian trucker protests. \u201cNow, they\u2019re impeding the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, one of the most active arteries for transnational commerce,\u201d El-Sayed pointed out. \u201cHere\u2019s what\u2019s so absurd about it: The protest over Covid restrictions is now disrupting peoples\u2019 everyday lives \u2013 which is what the protest was supposedly aimed at stopping. They\u2019ve lost the plot.\u201d Misinformation has flourished on Joe Rogan\u2019s controversial podcast, which has caused headaches for Spotify, the platform that reportedly invested more than $100 million in the show. \u201cRogan\u2019s everyman persona is attractive to millions who view themselves as fed up with perceived liberal and conservative media biases,\u201d Peniel E. Joseph noted. \u201cYet Rogan, in many instances, amplifies partisan divides by offering an unvarnished platform for some of the worst impulses in American culture. From Proud Boys to anti-vaxxers, Rogan has helped spread misinformation, furthered the coarsening of popular culture and trafficked in a kind of racial bigotry soft-pedaled in some corners of social media as merely the byproduct of speaking one\u2019s mind\u2026 \u201cEnter at your risk or pleasure (or both), but don\u2019t pretend that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re listening to.\u201d \u201cAn enduring mystery might finally have been solved,\u201d Eugene Robinson wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cRemember when Donald Trump ranted about how \u2018people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once,\u2019 and nobody knew what on earth he was talking about? Maybe he was referring to personal difficulties in trying to flush away official White House documents.\u201d Robinson was referring to a report from Maggie Haberman\u2019s forthcoming book that White House staff ran across toilets that were clogged with \u201cwads of clumped up wet printed paper.\u201d Trump denied disposing of records that way and brushed off reports that his administration failed to safeguard legally protected documents. \u201cMost presidents have violated the Presidential Records Act,\u201d wrote historian Julian Zelizer. \u201cBut former President Donald Trump\u2019s actions go further than previous presidents, amounting to egregious violations of a law that came about in the aftermath of President Richard Nixon\u2019s traumatic Watergate scandal\u2026 In recent days, the nation has learned that Trump made a habit of tearing up documents while he was in office. There have also been several news reports of Trump administration staffers putting documents in burn bags to be destroyed.\u201d Richard N. Bond served as the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1992 to 1993. So he has an informed vantage point on the world of trouble the RNC brought upon itself with three little words. The committee passed a censure resolution against Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger earlier this month that described the House select committee on which they serve as a politically-motivated effort to target citizens who engaged in \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d on January 6, 2021. In an open letter to current RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, Bond wrote, \u201cAt a time when our focus as a party should be on the Biden administration and Democrats at every level of power, you made former President Donald Trump\u2019s unquenchable thirst for revenge against Republicans who disagree with him the political story of the week.\u201d Recalling the events of January 6, Bond noted, \u201cMore than 725 rioters from nearly all 50 states have been arrested and charged with crimes related to the storming of the US Capitol. Five deaths are directly attributable to events of that day; approximately 140 law enforcement officers were treated for injuries. It could take millions of dollars to repair the damage caused by the rioters, according to congressional testimony by the architect of the US Capitol.\u201d As historian Nicole Hemmer wrote, \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d is \u201can odd way to describe the actions of a mob that chanted \u2018Hang Mike Pence\u2019 as it clashed with police before breaking through the doors and windows of the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. And while, after widespread ridicule, the RNC insisted that it was referring only to the nonviolent protesters supporting Trump\u2019s lie that the election was stolen from him, its attempt to whitewash right-wing violence is part of an ongoing pattern on the right\u2026 The end result of these efforts to minimize, excuse, and erase right-wing violence is an environment that invites even more of it.\u201d Inflation is not President Joe Biden\u2019s favorite topic. That\u2019s a fair conclusion from his encounters with the media on the topic. Last month, he was caught on a hot mic calling a Fox News reporter a \u201cstupid son of a bitch\u201d after the President was asked about the potential impact of inflation on this year\u2019s midterm elections. In an interview Thursday with NBC, Biden called Lester Holt a \u201cwise guy\u201d after the anchor pointed out that it had been more than six months since the President said the rise in prices was only temporary. Increasingly, Democrats fear that inflation is hurting Biden\u2019s approval ratings and the party\u2019s chances in the midterms.  The consumer price index jumped 7.5% in the 12 months ending in January, a 40-year high. Inflation is diluting the earnings of US consumers, and the Federal Reserve Bank has signaled that it will embark on a series of interest-rate increases which could slow the economy\u2019s growth. \u201cThe public tends to think of inflation as an indicator of a cycle of greed and inhumanity, as a conspiracy to rob them of their buying power,\u201d economist Robert J. Shiller wrote in the New York Times. \u201cIn reality, the cause is more technical, like an increase in the money supply or disruptions in the supply chain.\u201d But he added, \u201cWhen people start to think that inflation is a measure of collateral damage in the battle between big business and aggressive labor \u2013 when they blame, in effect, the wage-price spiral \u2013 they feed into the rhetoric of both the extreme left and the extreme right. America doesn\u2019t need another angry political narrative that may further erode our trust in one another, trust that we need for economic growth.\u201d In the 2018 Olympics, US figure skater Nathan Chen finished a disappointing fifth. In the run-up to 2022, he was favored to win the gold medal, having dominated a string of other major competitions. On Thursday, Chen finally fulfilled his dream \u2013 and the expectations of countless fans. Part of the appeal of the Games is watching people redeem themselves and realize their full promise, wrote Amy Bass. \u201cFor most of us mere mortals who cannot, as Chen did Thursday, land five quadruple jumps (or any kind of jump, for that matter), sport feels easy because that\u2019s how it looks \u2013 think how often we use words like \u2018effortless\u2019 to describe something as crazy as a triple axel \u2013 when the stars do what they are supposed to do.\u201d \u201cBut the stark contrast among the Team USA\u2019s gold rush in the last few days \u2013 Chloe Kim\u2019s confident yet emotional defense of her Olympic title on the halfpipe, (Lindsey) Jacobellis\u2019 long-awaited reclamation of Olympic glory, and Chen finally making things right after they had gone so very wrong \u2013 show just how extraordinary a feat it is to win.\u201d For more: Lincoln Mitchell: Controversy over gold-medalist Eileen Gu skiing for China misses the point Kara Alaimo: What to do about the social media shaming of figure skater Zhu Yi The world may have moved a step closer to an energy breakthrough that could one day end the reliance on fossil fuels. As physicist Don Lincoln wrote, \u201cOn December 21, 2021, an artificial sun briefly flickered into existence underneath the English countryside.\u201d Scientists, working at a center south of Oxford, created a nuclear fusion reaction for about five seconds, generating nearly 12 megawatts of power. It was likely a final moment of glory for the device that created it. \u201cThe extreme heat and pressure generated by the reaction means this is likely to be the JET\u2019s last hurrah.\u201d But another experimental facility is being built in southern France. Using nuclear fusion as a safe and clean energy source has been a goal since the mid-twentieth century. Back then, Lincoln noted, \u201cit was thought to be possible in about 20 to 30 years. But the estimate today is that it is still 20 to 30 years away. Given the reality of climate change and the fact that the energy needs of the future will certainly be greater than that of the present, this is a problem we have to solve. Additional investment in fusion technology research would certainly speed up the process.\u201d Governors in a number of liberal states are dropping Covid mask mandates, getting ahead of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House, which have taken a more cautious approach. It\u2019s worth rethinking the mandates, argued Jill Filipovic. \u201cYes, if case rates are low, the vaccinated should have more opportunities to live mask-free. Because let\u2019s be honest: Masks do come with costs. They can be uncomfortable, especially when worn for long periods at a time. They interrupt basic human communication \u2013 so much of how we understand each other and send subtle cues is through our facial expressions, which masks conceal. When we can\u2019t see each others\u2019 faces, we lose a primary means via which human animals connect, and, at least anecdotally, we can become even more atomized and less empathetic to each other. And while the impact of masking on children is still being studied and experts largely say that kids are flexible and can adapt or catch up, many parents and some experts worry that prolonged masking could impair children\u2019s language skills and their social and emotional development\u2026\u201d Filipovic pointed out that a constant part of life is balancing \u201ccompeting interests and potential harms. We do this all the time; we set speed limits and mandate seatbelts in cars, but we don\u2019t expect to have zero traffic fatalities \u2013 and we don\u2019t even set highway speed limits low enough to radically reduce traffic deaths because we\u2019ve essentially decided that we need people to be able to get where they\u2019re going, and that is worth the tradeoff.\u201d \u201cWhat we need is not just clear guidance for the here and now, but a clear formula for when mask mandates should lift, where they should lift, and when they may need to be reinstated. Covid-19 is not a static disease, and public health guidance should evolve as the disease does.\u201d It was another week of foreboding about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, punctuated by the spectacle of Presidents Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron seated at opposite ends of a table that seemed many times longer than the one that separated newspaper publisher Charles Foster Kane and his wife Emily as their marriage was disintegrating in \u201cCitizen Kane.\u201d \u201cMacron\u2019s Moscow visit this week produced humiliation \u2013 at least so far,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cAfter the talks, France announced that Putin had agreed to refrain from new military maneuvers near Ukraine, for the moment. The Kremlin\u2019s (Dmitry) Peskov later said he had no idea what the French were talking about; a slap in Macron\u2019s face.\u201d The Kremlin later explained that the long table was used because Macron had declined to take a Covid-19 test. \u201cThis moment demands understanding that the world is facing an authoritarian leader accustomed to bullying and intimidating,\u201d added Ghitis. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s not so much Russia facing off against Ukraine or against the West, as it is its authoritarian President. The West is scrambling for the right language because this, as Russia\u2019s neighbors and the rest of the world know, is Putin\u2019s show.\u201d For more: Leroy Chiao: What a NASA astronaut learned about working with Russians.

This year\u2019s gerrymanders are a \u201cpartisan bloodbath,\u201d wrote David Daley. \u201cBoth parties have wiped competitive seats off the board. While Republicans overwhelmingly gerrymandered more Congressional districts and state legislatures 10 years ago, Democrats have been just as aggressive this cycle in states where they have complete control.

View more opinion articles on CNN. The controversy over Joe Rogan\u2019s repeated past use of the n-word on his podcast is about more than racist language or cancel culture \u2013 it speaks to deeper truths and persistent lies that help define contemporary America. Rogan, who was already under fire earlier this year for being a conduit for misinformation brandished by anti-vaxxers on his popular show, faced immense backlash after a video compilation of him using the n-word, which he said were compiled over a span of 12 years, was widely shared on social media. Rogan apologized Saturday and vowed to do better, and Daniel Ek, the chief executive of Spotify \u2013 which distributes Rogan\u2019s podcast and invested $100 million dollars to do so, according to the Wall Street Journal \u2013 addressed the issue in a memo stating he found Rogan\u2019s words \u201cincredibly hurtful\u201d and inconsistent with company values but did not believe \u201csilencing\u201d Rogan was the answer. Ek also promised to launch an \u201cincremental $100 million\u201d dollar investment designed to elevate marginalized voices on Spotify. Spotify, without detailing specifically why, also removed more than 100 of Rogan\u2019s episodes from the platform, according to JRE Missing, a website that tracks the show. Conservatives who are defending Rogan with cries of free speech are being disingenuous. For one thing, it comes at a moment when conservatives have mastered the art of legislative cancelation, passing laws that threaten to fine and fire teachers who teach aspects of America\u2019s brutal history of racial inequity that might cause discomfort among White students or parents. The real issue isn\u2019t about whether to cancel Joe Rogan (although some have advocated for Spotify to end its relationship in wake of the controversy). It is about exposing who Rogan really is and admitting that his brand of conversation, which at times traffics in conspiracy theories, cultural intolerance and blatant racism, attracts millions of avid listeners and corporate sponsors hungry to advertise their wares to such followers. Rogan is, in fact, an agent of these social ills, which he packages and sends out to his audience clothed in the language of moderation and moral equivalence. For example, in addition to his uses of the n-word, Rogan has made waves by suggesting that because \u201cyou can never be woke enough \u2026 it\u2019ll eventually get to [where] White men are not allowed to talk.\u201d Rogan laughed uproariously when comedian Joey Diaz, one of his guests, described pressuring women into performing oral sex on him. Rogan has horribly and deliberately misgendered a trans MMA fighter. He\u2019s discouraged young people from getting the Covid-19 vaccine, hosted guests who question its validity and given a platform to climate skepticism from controversial clinical psychologist Jordan Peterson. Controversy over gold medalist Eileen Gu skiing for China misses the point The question of \u201csilencing\u201d Rogan is nevertheless a fraught one. In opposition to Rogan\u2019s platforming of Covid misinformation, a wide range of popular musicians, from the legendary rock n roll artist Neil Young to the Generation X soul icon India Arie, have demanded that Spotify remove their music from its site. They did not want their work to share digital space with the loquacious podcaster \u2013 who, beyond the n-word and misinformation criticisms, has also helped build the profile of Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes, whose group has used violence to foster political support for a racially intolerant agenda. Meanwhile, public figures including former President Donald Trump and Republican Governor Ron DeSantis have implored Rogan to stop apologizing for using the n-word. Trump told him to \u201cstop apologizing to the Fake News and Radical Left maniacs and lunatics,\u201d while DeSantis urged, \u201cDo not apologize. Do not kowtow to the mob. Stand up and tell them to pound sand.\u201d The far right-wing conservative support for Rogan belies the myth that his show represents a reasonable middle or common ground uniting average Americans untethered to the left-right spectrum of American politics. This myth reflects the lies Americans tell themselves about to race, democracy, free speech and capitalism. Rogan\u2019s genius lies in the fact that he presents himself as an everyman throwback to a quieter age \u2013 an era without pandemics or Black Lives Matter protests shining a spotlight on racial privilege. Ripping and burning: how Trump White House handled some legally protected documents Folks who enjoy Rogan\u2019s political unpredictability, down to earth quality, and frank discussion about politics ignore the fact that he\u2019s one of the wealthiest people in America, that his independent perspective often skews far-right (as evidenced by some of his guests, who have included Roseanne Barr, Ted Nugent, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens and Steven Crowder) and his everyman demeanor is the perfect shtick for a 21st century pitchman able to convince the have-nots that they share a common history, rapport and destiny with the haves. No wonder Trump loves him. Rogan also seems to delight in contradicting himself, posting a now-deleted tweet in 2012 to add fuel to the false birther conspiracy theory about President Barack Obama while also proclaiming Obama to be the best president in his lifetime and insisting that Michelle Obama could defeat Trump in a presidential election. In another episode Rogan said aired 11 years ago, he recalled being accidentally dropped off in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Philadelphia with some disbelieving White friends. He likened the situation to being in \u201cPlanet of the Apes,\u201d the 1968 science fiction classic starring Charlton Heston as an astronaut who travels in time to a future earth ruled by intelligent simians. Rogan\u2019s comparison of Philadelphia\u2019s Black community to the \u201cPlanet of the Apes\u201d is morally reprehensible, politically indefensible, and yes, racist. Rogan apologized for this clip in an Instagram video he posted Saturday, noting that he was trying to \u201cmake the story entertaining\u201d but also realized \u201cthat\u2019s a racist thing to say.\u201d But his audience of eleven million embraces these seeming contradictions. Rogan\u2019s popularity has increased amid the rightward drift and segmentation of social media and popular culture. He has been consistently able to draw a robust number of guests across the polarized American political spectrum. On the 'Putin Show' there is trash talk, massive tables and very little progress Even Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, who is multi-racial, initially defended Rogan \u2013 the same podcaster who introduced the leader of Proud Boys. When a writer pointed out Rogan\u2019s multiple uses of the n-word last week, Johnson thanked him, writing, \u201cI was not aware of his N word use prior to my comments, but now I\u2019ve become educated to his complete narrative. Learning moment for me.\u201d Any public personality attracting effusive support from Trump and DeSantis, two exemplars of racial and cultural intolerance, can not purport to be, as Rogan does, an independent thinker. Rogan\u2019s everyman persona is attractive to millions who view themselves as fed up with perceived liberal and conservative media biases. Yet Rogan, in many instances, amplifies partisan divides by offering an unvarnished platform for some of the worst impulses in American culture. From Proud Boys to anti-vaxxers, Rogan has helped spread misinformation, furthered the coarsening of popular culture and trafficked in a kind of racial bigotry soft-pedaled in some corners of social media as merely the byproduct of speaking one\u2019s mind. Critics of Rogan have a right, like musicians have, to disassociate themselves from platforms that carry his brand of discourse. That\u2019s not canceling, that\u2019s consumer choice, a right everyone ostensibly enjoys in a free society. Spotify, in trying to preserve their profits and their image by enabling Rogan and censoring the worst parts of his act (they have removed 113 podcast and counting from his archive) \u2013 while also trying to elevate the voices of marginalized groups \u2013 is an illustration of how far capitalism will bend to use race and Blackness for its own purposes. Meanwhile, Rogan\u2019s and Spotify\u2019s ability to monetize the most noxious and racially intolerant parts of American history and culture has, if anything, been amplified, rather than suppressed, by this latest uproar. Political controversy sells, racial controversy even more so, especially when used to fly the banner of free speech.  Joe Rogan\u2019s platform, it has now been revealed for the world to see, is less a bastion of independence of mind and free expression of thought and more a haven for racial intolerance, sexist insults and the kind of so-called \u201clocker room talk\u201d that made Trump a hero to many among his base \u2013 and helped turn Rogan into a social media sensation in the first place. Enter at your risk or pleasure (or both), but don\u2019t pretend that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re listening to.",

View more opinion on CNN. The Republican National Committee on Friday censured Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, arguing that they \u201csupport Democrat(ic) efforts to destroy President (Donald) Trump more than they support winning back a Republican majority in 2022.\u201d Their shame-worthy act? Participating in the January 6 select committee currently investigating last year\u2019s attack on the Capitol. According to the committee, aiding the investigation is an offense not just against the Trump-supporting GOP but against the republic itself, because it involves an unjust persecution of people engaged in \u201clegitimate political discourse.\u201d This phrase is an odd way to describe the actions of a mob that chanted \u201cHang Mike Pence\u201d as it clashed with police before breaking through the doors and windows of the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. And while, after widespread ridicule, the RNC insisted that it was referring only to the nonviolent protesters supporting Trump\u2019s lie that the election was stolen from him, its attempt to whitewash right-wing violence is part of an ongoing pattern on the right. The GOP\u2019s effort to minimize the horrifying events of January 6 has been well-documented: from the attempts to shift blame to left-wing protestors in the immediate aftermath of the insurrection, to a House Republican likening some of the insurrectionists seen that day to \u201ca normal tourist visit,\u201d to the widespread campaign to paint the insurrectionists as peaceful patriots. But it\u2019s important to place those efforts to erase the violence on January 6 in the recent history of right-wing politics in the US, to illuminate an arc of radicalization and official sanction that makes future political violence more likely. Attempts to redefine violence as \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d have been central to the Trump-era right. As a candidate and then president, Trump regularly sanctioned violence, whether encouraging his fans to pummel protesters or police officers to rough up suspects (\u201cWhen you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in, rough, I said, please don\u2019t be too nice.\u201d). These statements were often shrugged off as Trumpian excesses, but they were part of a broader blurring of political discourse and political violence. Trump\u2019s comments after Charlottesville, his reflexive defense of some mysterious faction of \u201cvery fine people\u201d mixed in with the neo-Nazi and White-power organizers of the Unite the Right rally in 2017, also fits this pattern. But more importantly, the way the organizers framed that rally demonstrated the tactical relationship between \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d and political violence. Attempts to move the planned rally were thwarted by a court order issued the night before. What the January 6 report means for the future of democracy Yet, even as lawyers were arguing in court, the rallygoers were gathering tiki torches in preparation for a march through Charlottesville. That torchlit march, an act of both intimidation and violence, went hand in hand with the organizers\u2019 appeals to free speech: protected political discourse was covered in the news in the aftermath of the deadly political violence in Charlottesville. The RNC\u2019s appeal to \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d is an effort to engage in the same water-muddying exercise. By attempting to make the investigations into January 6 an attack on discourse rather than a response to violence, the party is trying to cram the insurrection into a culture-wars framework. Instead of an attack on Congress and an effort to overthrow the election, the story instead becomes one of the persecution of hundreds of patriots simply trying to voice their views and instead of running into a censorious, ruinous cancel-culture mob. A classical reversal: the mob becomes the victim, the victims the mob. The right is attempting the same sort of reversal with the racial justice protests of 2020. Though there was some support for them from conservatives in May and early June 2020, that is now almost entirely absent. Instead, the protests have become a counterpoint to the insurrection: those violent protesters were excused as racial justice advocates, while these peaceful protesters have been painted as insurrectionists. You\u2019ll find that comparison regularly invoked on right-wing broadcasts and podcasts over the past year. Yet there is an erasure of violence there as well. Because what is never mentioned in those conversations is what the racial justice protesters were responding to: rampant and lawless police violence. That violence was regularly on display in 2020, not just in the murder of George Floyd but also in the clashes with peaceful protesters across the country.  But in right-wing narratives of 2020, law enforcement violence has largely disappeared, leaving the occasional acts of property destruction that happened alongside the nationwide peaceful demonstrations to stand in, not as the equivalent of the insurrection, but something much worse. The end result of these efforts to minimize, excuse, and erase right-wing violence is an environment that invites even more of it. Because if a mob can ransack the Capitol while hunting for members of Congress in an effort to overthrow an election \u2013 an effort that Trump and his administration both encouraged and attempted through their own antidemocratic efforts \u2013 only to emerge as something between political protesters and persecuted heroes, then why would they swear off violence in the future? Why wouldn\u2019t they see mob attacks as a form of \u201clegitimate political discourse\u201d?",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. When this redistricting cycle began, many experts predicted a gory Gerrymandering Apocalypse. They warned redistricting alone could determine control of the US House for the next decade, and that Republicans, once again, had the upper hand. They feared another unhappy ending with maps \u2013 rather than voters \u2013 determining election results, a sequel to the influential GOP-directed effort of a decade ago: REDMAP II: The Wrath of Karl Rove! But read the latest reviews and there\u2019s been a plot twist, of sorts. \u201cDemocrats avert total redistricting doomsday,\u201d pronounced Politico. \u201cSurprising,\u201d declared NBC News. Indeed, by some online counts, it\u2019s the Democrats that could come out ahead after redistricting, perhaps netting as many as three seats heading into the midterms. If this trend continues, some observers calculate, the national Congressional map could be as balanced as it has been at any time since the landmark US Supreme Court cases of the 1960s sparked the reapportionment revolution. That would be quite an unexpected turn: Republicans had monopoly power to draw 187 congressional seats, while Democrats had complete control over just over 75. Many Democrats expected to battle not only historically stiff midterm winds, but also to run uphill on maps tilted toward the GOP. Here\u2019s the problem with that analysis: First, it\u2019s premature. Only 31 states have finished drawing  \u2013 and Republican lawmakers in Tennessee and New Hampshire have passed maps that erase Democratic seats. Tennessee Governor Bill Lee signed the proposal in his state, while New Hampshire\u2019s proposal awaits its governor\u2019s signature. GOP lawmakers in Florida and Missouri are still debating exactly how aggressive their gerrymanders should be. Meanwhile, litigation could change the picture even in states that have enacted maps. Late last Friday, North Carolina\u2019s state supreme court overturned a congressional map that many analysts believed would gift Republicans at least 10 of the state\u2019s 14 seats. That pushed several Democratic seats that the GOP had moved red back into the blue column. Then late Monday, the US Supreme Court restored an Alabama congressional map that a lower court had ordered reworked to more accurately represent the state\u2019s racial diversity. That shifted a seat from red to blue to red again, and ended Democratic hopes that it might also create additional Black opportunity districts in Louisiana and South Carolina. Pending cases from New York (drawn by Democrats) Ohio (by the GOP) could unravel similarly lopsided maps \u2013 and dramatically rework the calculus again. Second, the punditry doesn\u2019t align with the facts. A rigorous new study by three top scholars finds that while the US House map has a fairer partisan balance than it did a decade ago, it remains skewed in favor of Republicans. More importantly, looking at redistricting solely as a Red vs Blue horse race distorts what a partisan bloodbath this cycle has actually been. When the US Supreme Court halts the new map in Alabama, after all, what\u2019s important is not that it costs Democrats a likely seat. It\u2019s that it perpetuates the historical underrepresentation of Black voters. It\u2019s voters \u2013 especially voters of color in Alabama, Texas and Georgia, but also red-state Democrats and blue-state Republicans \u2013 who end up short-changed and underrepresented. And when wildly uncompetitive districts turn low-turnout party primaries into the only race that matters, gerrymandering accelerates our already toxic polarization and pushes policy to extremes. Gerrymandering, after all, isn\u2019t just about nabbing seats from the other side. It\u2019s about making your own seats safer \u2013 and less competitive for voters \u2013 after a decade of demographic and political change. Indeed, as this cycle concludes, the number of competitive congressional districts will dwindle to the lowest number in modern times. At the current pace, according to a New York Times estimate, there will be fewer than 40 competitive US House seats nationwide after redistricting, down from nearly 75 following last decade\u2019s redistricting. With 435 seats in the House, that means about one in every 11 will be a contest without a predetermined winner. That\u2019s not exactly \u201caverting doomsday.\u201d Both parties have wiped competitive seats off the board. While Republicans overwhelmingly gerrymandered more Congressional districts and state legislatures 10 years ago, Democrats have been just as aggressive this cycle in states where they have complete control. The brazen gerrymander passed by New York Democrats last week not only locked in 22 blue seats in a 26-member delegation, but eliminated all four of the competitive districts where President Biden and Donald Trump finished within five points of each other in 2020. Josh Hawley joins Tucker Carlson in ripping a gash in GOP's Ukraine stance Researchers have found the bulk of the decline in competitive seats can be attributed to a handful of GOP maps in states like Texas, Georgia and Indiana. Republicans, who had already maxed out their gains in many of the states under their control, have also tried to erase the remaining competitive seats in red states that provided Democrats with the path to the House majority in 2018. Democrats, after all, did not overcome GOP gerrymandering to win the House: According to a Brennan Center analysis,  more than 70% of the seats that flipped were drawn by courts and commissions, and then they pulled an inside straight with purplish seats in some states. Take Oklahoma, for example, where a Democrat, Kendra Horn, captured the competitive fifth district in 2018. Republicans dismantled that seat by cracking Oklahoma City and spreading those Democratic voters across three different districts, all of which favor the GOP by wide margins. (Trump won the district by 5 percentage points in 2020; under these lines he would have won by 19.)  It\u2019s a similar story in Utah, which Trump easily won in 2020 despite losing Salt Lake county, the largest in the state, home to nearly 40% of Utahns. Two different Democrats won a competitive district there during the last cycle, but that won\u2019t happen again: The new map divides Salt Lake across four districts, attaching a small piece of urban blue to a giant swath of rural, conservative red. Republicans look likely to zero out similar competitive seats won by Democrats in 2018 in Kansas and South Carolina, and shored themselves up in the suburbs of Omaha and Indianapolis. Tennessee\u2019s new map slices blue Nashville into so many parts that veteran Democratic lawmaker Jim Cooper took one look at the new lines and retired. Republicans snagged a seat in New Hampshire by swapping 75 towns and more than 365,000 people into a new district. If everything\u2019s bigger in Texas, so are the redistricting shenanigans. There were 12 competitive Congressional elections here in 2020. Post-redistricting? Only one. Texas provides a good example of how lawmakers entrench themselves at the expense of communities of color. Minority population growth \u2013 largely Latino and Asian \u2013 drove 95% of the population growth that earned Texas two additional seats in Congress. But Latinos and Blacks lose political power under the new maps \u2013 and those two new seats were drawn to elect White conservatives. Just look at the way Texas lawmakers turned the 24th congressional district \u2013 the rapidly expanding suburbs of Dallas and Fort Worth \u2013 inside-out to keep a growing Latino district red. In 2020, this district went for Biden by 5 percentage points, and provided the state\u2019s closest congressional battle; GOP incumbent Beth Van Duyne held off Candace Valenzuela\u2019s bid to become the first Black Latina in Congress by 1.3 percentage points. The new 24th is a funhouse inversion of itself, made safely Republican by putting majority-minority cities like Valenzeula\u2019s hometown of Carrollton through a paper shredder and scattering those largely Latino voters across five different congressional districts. There was good news this cycle. New commissions in Michigan and Colorado did show that citizens can draw balanced, responsive maps. State supreme courts in Ohio, Virginia and North Carolina have defended constitutional protections against extreme maps that pick winners and losers. And if \u2013 a big if \u2013 the two parties fight to a draw and neither side \u201cwins\u201d redistricting (and Republicans are still likely to emerge with an edge), that\u2019s better news than expected at a time when our democracy can use it.  But better than expected isn\u2019t good enough. A frozen, nationalized map provides voters with very little choice. It\u2019s vulnerable to being hijacked by extremes in party primaries. And when seats can\u2019t budge, it runs the very real risk of being non-responsive to the public will. Perhaps this cycle\u2019s gerrymandering horror show is less over the top, perhaps the villains are harder to identify. The ending is likely to be the same: The People\u2019s House belongs to the mapmakers.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. President Joe Biden is wrestling with the volatile politics of crime, a controversial issue which may impact his popularity and the standing of the Democrats going into this year\u2019s midterm election. But it would a big mistake if Biden let the political temptations of the moment guide his position on an issue that is critical to the health of our democracy. During his trip to New York City on Thursday, Biden met with Mayor Eric Adams and spoke about the need to curb gun violence. At a moment when Adams is dealing with a series of high-profile crimes in the city, the Biden administration is acknowledging the problem and taking steps to show it can be tough on crime. This visit also appears to be an attempt to push back against progressives who are calling to \u201cdefund the police,\u201d and neutralize any GOP attacks on Democrats for being soft on crime. The issue of rising crime has gained even more attention after two NYPD officers, Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora, were shot and killed while responding to a domestic disturbance call last month. As a result, Alvin Bragg, the new Manhattan district attorney, has come under political fire for issuing a memo promoting, among other things, alternatives to incarceration \u2013 a stance he has partly walked back and since tried to clarify. Trump's growing recklessness is a ticking time bomb It didn\u2019t help that actor Susan Sarandon shared a Twitter post on Thursday comparing the thousands of officers who attended Rivera\u2019s funeral to fascists, adding, \u201cSo, if all these cops weren\u2019t needed for CRIME that day, doesn\u2019t that mean they aren\u2019t needed ANY day?\u201d Sarandon\u2019s post, and the understandable backlash that followed, highlighted the tension around policing in stark terms. But supporting criminal justice reform doesn\u2019t mean supporting lawlessness \u2013 and Biden would be making a mistake if he acted out of political expedience and tried to take on crime without addressing the problem of racism. The #BlackLivesMatter movement put forth a powerful critique of racism in policing and the criminal justice system that is firmly rooted in decades of social scientific research. The kinds of bias that resulted in the tragic death of George Floyd in 2020 have always had a powerful hold on how policing is carried out in this country. In his own policies, Adams, a former police officer, has tried to take a more nuanced approach to crime than some of his critics suggest. Despite being a staunch supporter of the police department and supporting controversial measures such as stop-and-frisk, Adams has often recounted his own experience of being beaten by the police as a teenager. For many years, Adams advocated for reforms to protect communities subject to police harassment and spoke out against the targeting of Black and Hispanic New Yorkers for low-level offenses. While many Democrats tagged as \u201ctough on crime\u201d do support substantial reforms to address racism, it should be noted that the basic premise of the #BlackLivesMatter movement can\u2019t be ignored. The need to rethink some of the fundamental ways in which policing works and the underlying structure of sentencing guidelines that are affected by racial bias must remain at the top of Biden\u2019s agenda. It could be that taking steps to reform the police is not the popular thing to do. But a central part of wielding presidential power is using it to pursue policies that are morally just. According to biographer Robert Caro, when President Lyndon Johnson faced advisers who urged him to be practical and avoid long-shot challenges, he responded by saying, \u201cWell, what the hell\u2019s the presidency for?\u201d Josh Hawley joins Tucker Carlson in ripping a gash in GOP's Ukraine stance Indeed, when LBJ moved forward with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which banned legal segregation in public accommodations and employment discrimination, the President accepted it was a huge political risk. But he responded to a grassroots movement that was shaking the conscience of the nation and acted knowing full well that he could lose the South, which was the base of the Democratic Party. Today, nearly 10 years since Trayvon Martin was killed, the nation is in great danger of moving on. Since that horrendous incident in 2012, the #BlackLivesMatter movement has made great strides in pushing the nation to confront the ways in which institutional racism plays out in our criminal justice system \u2013 a problem that generations of civil rights activists tried to shine a light on without much success. Indeed, even when Johnson set up the Kerner Commission, which released its report in February 1968 highlighting how \u201cwhite racism\u201d in policing had been the reason so many cities went up in flames during the summer of 1967, the government didn\u2019t do much. Rather than addressing the issue, the country voted for Richard Nixon, who championed \u201claw and order\u201d in the 1968 presidential campaign. We could see a similar pattern play out today. More moderate Democrats have already blamed progressives for alienating voters and allowing Republicans to make inroads in the 2020 elections. But now is not the time to make the same mistake the government did in 1968. Institutional racism in the criminal justice system is a major national crisis that continues to leave Black Americans and other marginalized groups in grave danger just for walking the streets. It also leaves too many young people without the resources they need for a fair trial and locked up in correctional facilities that have grown significantly over the past few decades.  A President who tries to game out exactly what policy positions will win the elusive moderate vote in our era of polarization is taking on a fool\u2019s errand. One thing that Biden can do, however, is take a genuine stand and promote policies that address racism in policing, sentencing and prisons because it is the right thing to do.",

One through-line of some recent \u2013 and deeply disturbing \u2013 incidents is the sense that the Holocaust is a fossilized historical fact with little connection to us today. First, a school board in Tennessee voted unanimously to ban \u201cMaus,\u201d a Pulitzer-Prize-winning book that laid out Nazis\u2019 horrific crimes, in what is only the latest incident in a tidal wave of book-bans in conservative areas. Then, Nazis rallied near Orlando, and while some Florida lawmakers quickly publicly condemned the gathering, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis did not. He claimed in a press conference Monday requests for him to do so were attempts to \u201csmear me as if I had something to do with it.\u201d His spokeswoman, Christina Pushaw, speculated on Twitter that the self-identified Nazis may not really be Nazis (spoiler: the Nazis were Nazis). Pushaw later deleted the tweet and said she regretted her \u201cflippant\u201d tone. DeSantis, even as he called the demonstrators \u201cjackasses\u201d and \u201cmalcontents\u201d who would be held accountable for blocking the road, still defensively (and absurdly) portrayed himself as a victim. And finally, \u201cThe View\u201d co-host Whoopi Goldberg said during a roundtable discussion of the \u201cMaus\u201d ban that the Holocaust wasn\u2019t about race. It was \u201cWhite people doing it to White people,\u201d she said of the Nazi plan to exterminate Jews and other non-Aryan groups in their quest to establish a single master race. Goldberg apologized, first on Twitter and later on air. The \u201cMaus\u201d ban has been national news. Other Florida politicians, including several Republicans, have spoken out against the Nazi protest. But these incidents together paint a troubling picture of world-changing history badly understood, and the dangerous reality of anti-Semitism set aside. Appeals to learn the Holocaust\u2019s lessons and to see the ongoing reality of anti-Semitism are often met defensively \u2013 to use DeSantis\u2019s words, \u201cas if I had something to do with it.\u201d Goldberg didn\u2019t just say that the Holocaust wasn\u2019t about race. She said, \u201cWell, this is White people doing it to White people, so y\u2019all gonna fight amongst yourselves,\u201d making the Holocaust someone else\u2019s issue. The Tennessee school board banned \u201cMaus,\u201d it said, because of the book\u2019s \u201cunnecessary use of profanity and nudity and its depiction of violence and suicide,\u201d as though it would be possible to depict one of the most violent events of the last century without depicting violence. History, it turns out, contains a lot of disturbing and inappropriate content. And so does the present: Anti-Semitic incidents are up, and just last month, a gunman held four people hostage at a Texas synagogue. This insistence that terrible historical events are simply the outcome of individual bad actors \u2013 or simply \u201cman\u2019s inhumanity to man,\u201d as Goldberg put it \u2013 is dangerous. History is not divorced from the long arc of what came before; it is not unrelated to us today. Believing terrible events are simply random and isolated blips consigns us to collective ignorance and leaves us well positioned for a repeat. You hear echoes of this same school of thought from the White people who insist that slavery has nothing to do with me because I didn\u2019t enslave anyone, and who in turn seek to obscure the many ways in which slavery shaped and continues to shape America\u2019s laws, its geography, and its unequal racial outcomes. Instead of grappling with our history and what it means for our lives today, a lot of people want to wash their hands of it. Cops who prey on drivers so their cities can profit One Republican politician in Texas emailed school superintendents a list of 850 books that might \u201cmake students feel discomfort, guilt, anguish\u201d \u2013 as though discomfort, guilt, and anguish are not normal human reactions to learning about genocide, enslavement, and other horrifying things that human beings have done to each other, often after organizing people into race- or ethnicity-based hierarchies. Republicans in Texas and several other conservative states have also tried to change the way history is taught \u2013 to literally rewrite history to suit their political aims, to position their state\u2019s past leaders and citizens as less culpable in wrongdoing than they were, and to curtail the ability of educators to teach students how to think critically and connect the past to the present. These moves matter not just because of the clich\u00e9 that \u201cthose who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it.\u201d They matter because education, history, and information are the grounds upon which a society is built. When you erode them, the whole house can crumble. Whoever controls the narrative about the past has more power over the present. Totalitarian leaders know this, which is why rewriting history is a staple of autocratic regimes. The United States is at a fragile moment. The stability of our democracy has been tested by four years of a despotic-wannabe president, a deadly riot that sought to overturn the results of a free and fair election, a right-wing party that has descended further and further into authoritarianism and that includes hundreds of members who, like the violent Jan. 6th rioters, refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election, and three years of a devastating pandemic. We are atomized, isolated and divided; we don\u2019t just disagree on policy or even values, but on the very definition of truth and what counts as fact versus fiction. Huge swaths of the country have been taken in by dangerous conspiracy theories and believe outright lies related to the 2020 presidential election results. Hundreds of thousands of people have died or gotten seriously ill and still a horrifying number of Americans have refused to get a safe, effective and free vaccine that has been shamefully politicized by conservatives and the Republican Party.  These are not conditions under which a functional democracy can survive. They are conditions under which thousands of human beings are not surviving. Pulling through requires what increasingly feels impossible: living in a shared reality. Writing off the horrors of history as someone else\u2019s problem and dismissing them as unrelated to today is factually incorrect. It also diminishes our ability to understand how complex systems of power, the manipulation of information, and the falsification of history have led, again and again, to horrific outcomes \u2013 and it condemns us to repeat the same dangerous cycle.",

The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. This will be a fateful year for autocrats around the world. In Brazil and Hungary, strongman leaders Jair Bolsonaro and Viktor Orb\u00e1n are standing for re-election. In the Philippines, term limits are bringing Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s tumultuous presidency to an end. While in the United States, midterm elections held under the shadow of the false Republican claim that Joe Biden \u201cstole\u201d the 2020 election from Donald Trump could give an authoritarian-leaning GOP control of Congress. 2022 is also the third year of the Covid-19 pandemic, which has been a double-edged sword for autocratic leaders who privilege the maintenance of their personal power over public welfare. Some, like Hungary\u2019s Orb\u00e1n, have used it to accumulate more authority. In March 2020, he capitalized on the state of emergency in Hungary to rule by decree. Others, like Trump, who governed in a still-robust democracy, found out that mismanagement of the crisis could end in their defeat. The pandemic has been a stress test for both democratic and authoritarian governments. Around the world, it has worsened existing economic inequities and caused immense loss of life: Over 5.5 million deaths have so far been recorded by John Hopkins University and others. By making painfully clear the costs of corrupt and callous leadership, it has also infused social justice movements around the globe with new vigor and clarity. Strongman leaders are particularly susceptible to coming undone by a global health emergency like Covid-19. In some cases, their arrogance downplaying the seriousness of coronavirus \u2013 and its fatal consequences \u2013 can be directly compared with how other countries handle the very same threat. Citizens can see the virus doesn\u2019t bow down to strongman commands \u2013 it follows scientific rules. Let\u2019s look at how Covid-19\u2019s impact may be felt in elections to be held in hotspots of autocracy this coming year. First up is Orb\u00e1n. Hungary\u2019s prime minister faces a challenge in the April parliamentary election from a newly unified opposition. Six parties are putting aside their political differences to run jointly against what coalition leader Peter Marki-Zay calls a \u201ccorrupt dictatorship.\u201d Orb\u00e1n\u2019s advantage as the incumbent may be magnified by a repeat of gerrymandering, vote rigging and other tactics that critics say altered the outcome of the 2018 election. While Orb\u00e1n appeals to voters with economic relief (tax rebates, pension and wage increases), the concentration of wealth among his cronies, including from EU contracts, stands out at a time of pandemic-fueled inflation and misery. Orban\u2019s government spokesman, Zoltan Kovacs, brushed off these allegations to CNN at the time, saying it was \u201cup to the courts to decide\u201d in such cases. Orb\u00e1n wants a Chinese university in Hungary. Opponents see a chance to turn his nationalist rhetoric against him Nor does Hungary\u2019s lack of transparency about public health data inspire trust. Hungary has no official Covid-19 dashboard of trends and geographic breakdowns (though it does have an official government website including daily deaths and infections) and crackdowns on press freedoms make reporting on the pandemic difficult. Orb\u00e1n may be the darling of the American GOP, but the unprecedented alliance of parties against him speaks to a decline in his authority. Next we turn to the Philippines. In May, Filipinos will reckon with the consequences of a leader who uses force to cover his lack of rigorous policies, including in public health matters. Critics charge that outgoing president Duterte has exploited his emergency powers to suppress freedom of speech (his loyalists shut down the ABS-CBN media network by not passing bills that would have granted it a new license) and passed economic measures that benefited big business and foreign investors, rather than the sick and the jobless. Mass vaccinations only started in March 2021, and Duterte\u2019s response \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll have you arrested and I\u2019ll inject the vaccine in your butt\u201d \u2013  sums up his attitude toward those he governs. While the investigation by the Hague-based International Criminal Court into Duterte\u2019s use of extrajudicial violence in his war on drugs is on hold, he will not be standing for re-election due to term limits. As of writing, Duterte is not endorsing any candidate \u2013 including Ferdinand \u201cBongbong\u201d Marcos Jr., who is running for president with Duterte\u2019s own daughter, Sara Duterte, and is the son of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. This volatile situation could help opposition candidates like Leni Robredo, the current vice president. Her progressive \u201cpink revolution\u201d has about 700,000 volunteers working in over 200 organizations. Robredo challenges not just Duterte\u2019s agenda, but longstanding nostalgia for the original Marcos \u2013 another despot who failed to provide for his people in their time of need. Brazil's parents want their kids vaccinated against Covid. Bolsonaro has tried to stop it The same could be said of Brazil\u2019s Bolsonaro, who is up for re-election in October. The president deployed the strongman\u2019s playbook in using misinformation to downplay the severity of Covid-19; in firing experts, like his health minister, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, who contradicted him in recommending social distancing; and rejected offers from manufacturers of vaccines for the ailing Brazilian population. Even cash-transfer payments given to the poor as pandemic relief have not saved his approval rating, which plummeted in November. That has fueled support for the opposition candidate, former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a leftist who was jailed in 2018 on corruption and money laundering charges. Da Silva always attributed those charges to political machinations, and they were recently annulled. He has called Bolsonaro \u201can agent of genocide\u201d for his pandemic negligence. A Brazilian congressional panel agrees; in October it recommended that Bolsonaro be charged  with \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d Meanwhile Bolsonaro is adamant he\u2019s not going anywhere, as he told local media in August: \u201cMy message is: only God takes me out of that post,\u201d raising the prospect that he\u2019d refuse to accept an electoral loss. Yet any such authoritarian action is likely to go badly for him given his low popularity. Around the world, the pandemic has accelerated in many the feeling that the autocratic model of governance, with its suppression of freedoms, plunder of the environment and creation of oligarchies, has run its course.  The recent Chilean presidential elections may herald the ascent of a new generation of leaders attentive to economic and racial inequality and the costs of dismantling social safety nets. The leftist Gabriel Boric, a 35-year-old former student activist, defeated the 55-year-old former congressman Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, who praised Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and his regime known for its violence and neoliberal policies. It could be an early sign that a desire for more accountable, transparent, and democratic leadership is emerging from the calamity of Covid-19.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell rules the roost on Capitol Hill. The Kentucky Republican, reprising the playbook he used against former President Barack Obama, is successfully obstructing President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda in a way that exposes the divisions within the Democratic Party and leaves the commander in chief looking weak. Much of the press coverage surrounding Biden\u2019s performance ignores the elephant in the room\u2014a united Senate Republican caucus standing in the way of almost everything and using the threat of the filibuster to prevent legislation from passing outside the reconciliation process. McConnell has kept his political army disciplined, united and on point. Playing the long game, as he always does, the Senator waited out the initial popularity of the President until the gears of the legislative process came to a grinding halt. Joe Biden is not failing or flailing With the Build Back Better bill still in limbo and voting rights legislation all but dead, media discussions about Biden\u2019s struggles have intensified. Polls continue to show Biden is fighting public perceptions that he is ineffective on several key fronts, including the economy. In an astute piece for The Washington Post, Greg Sargent argues the President faces a double whammy because of McConnell\u2019s handiwork: independent voters are unhappy with Biden\u2019s inability to achieve bipartisanship\u2014something that had as much chance as the Easter Bunny showing up to a White House meeting\u2014while Democrats are feeling blue about his inability to achieve big things. McConnell did give Senate Republicans wiggle room to support the $1.2 billion infrastructure bill. This was not a total surprise, however. After all, spending on roads, bridges and broadband has support from both parties given the benefits to voters in all states, red and blue. More importantly, by allowing the infrastructure bill to pass with bipartisan support, McConnell must have known the President would lose his biggest bargaining chip to persuade Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia to support the Build Back Better bill. Passing the infrastructure bill may have been a win, but it meant Democrats ended up giving away the biggest carrot to dangle before Manchin \u2013 without having any sticks to resort to. Since Manchin wanted infrastructure, using it to pressure him to support a version of the Build Back Better bill could have been an effective way to get both pieces of legislation passed. Other than infrastructure, the Senate GOP has stood firm against almost everything else the President wants to do. It was notable that even the so-called moderates of the party, such as Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, voted to block Democrats from advancing voting rights legislation this week. Bernie Sanders: The time for Senate talk is over. We need to vote McConnell, of course, also relied on obstruction when Obama was in the White House. Despite the dire state the GOP found itself in after the 2008 election, with an unpopular war in Iraq still raging and the economy in shambles, McConnell made opposition his top priority. The Dr. No of Washington, DC, McConnell embodied the Groucho Marx line, \u201cWhatever it is, I\u2019m against it,\u201d in a strategy that paid off handsomely in the 2010 midterms. The Republicans performed extremely well, taking back control of the House of Representatives, and making advances in state legislative and gubernatorial races. The midterms were a \u201cshellacking,\u201d Obama admitted. McConnell\u2019s strategy of ruthless obstruction, which continues today, rests on two pillars. The first is that the Senate Republicans, under McConnell, remain in lockstep. On the whole, Republicans are pretty good at staying on the same page. Democrats, on the other hand, represent a wider range of views on the political spectrum, from progressives to Manchin, whose own website boasts he voted with the Trump administration 74% of the time. The second factor is the filibuster. This procedure has been used so much in recent decades, with Republicans comfortable deploying the threat on almost any issue, we effectively have a 60-vote threshold for passing legislation, an incredibly high bar which has rendered the Senate ineffectual. So even while Democrats have a thin majority in Congress, the filibuster allows McConnell to maintain undue influence. The only other viable option is to move through the reconciliation process, which requires a simple majority, although all included measures must be directly related to the budget, whether it\u2019s tied to spending, tax revenues or the debt limit. The future of the GOP isn't about Ron DeSantis or Glenn Youngkin McConnell acts from a position of strength given that most Americans don\u2019t pay much attention to congressional politics. We are a nation that mythologizes presidential power, treating the inhabitant of the Oval Office as if he has the power to change the world with the wave of a hand. But presidents are only as good as their party\u2019s congressional standing. When legislation gets hung up on procedures like the filibuster, Americans often mistake the inability to act on the president. Biden knows there is a long history of Democratic presidents confronting this problem. After the 1938 midterm elections, a conservative coalition of southern Democrats and Midwestern Republicans dominated Capitol Hill. Over the next three decades, they often controlled the major committees to check liberal initiatives such as civil rights and health care. This coalition relied on the filibuster to make sure efforts to achieve racial justice fell short. While Washington, DC, insiders understood the power of this coalition, most Americans had no idea why Presidents Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy had so much trouble fulfilling their promises. It wasn\u2019t until a massive civil rights movement took hold at the grassroots level and the 1964 election brought in huge liberal majorities into the House and Senate the logjam was finally broken. While Lyndon B. Johnson proved to be a highly effective president, this was also the result of favorable conditions in Congress until the conservative coalition returned to power in the 1966 midterms. When Biden became a senator in 1973, he was part of a young cohort of Democrats shaking up Congress to wrestle control away from the old southern committee barons.  The good news for Democrats is McConnell\u2019s political tactics might not prevent Biden from being reelected. As I argued last week for CNN, many presidents have rebounded from tough moments like these. But McConnell, who has undercut Biden\u2019s effectiveness and stymied the President\u2019s agenda, may hurt Democrats who were hoping to tout progress on issues like climate change and an expanded safety net in the 2022 midterms. In a long press conference to mark his first year in office, Biden said, \u201cI did not anticipate that there\u2019d be such a stalwart effort to make sure that the most important thing was that President Biden didn\u2019t get anything done.\u201d But Biden had front row seats to this obstruction when he was vice president. McConnell has been doing the same thing for over a decade, and the odds are he won\u2019t change a bit in the coming years. At least Biden is now saying out loud what has been glaringly obvious from the first day of his presidency: McConnell\u2019s prime objective is protecting partisan power, and he will pursue that goal at all costs.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Beyond partisan politics and personal ambition, voting rights \u2013 who has them and who doesn\u2019t \u2013 is the story of America. President Joe Biden, near the end of his riveting speech in support of voting rights in Atlanta last week, challenged Republicans by laying down a particularly resonant historical gauntlet. Did the GOP want to be on the side of \u201cDr. King or George Wallace?\u201d Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, infamously vowed to defend \u201csegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,\u201d in 1963 as he became the most visible symbol of White supremacy as expressed by elected officials during the civil rights era. Wallace famously vowed to defend Alabama from racial integration by blocking the entry of Black students (accompanied by federal officials) who desegregated the University of Alabama on June 11, 1963. His embrace of segregation as a path to power was deliberate; after being defeated in an earlier gubernatorial bid, he reportedly told a journalist that \u201cnobody listened\u201d when he talked about infrastructure or education, but when he stoked racist fervor (he used different words), they \u201cstomped the floor.\u201d Wallace\u2019s hard-sought infamy on race matters catapulted him into the national political scene. His 1968 presidential campaign attracted almost 10 million popular votes and threatened to put the election in the House of Representatives if neither Republican Richard Nixon nor Democrat Hubert Humphrey achieved the necessary electoral college majority. Wallace\u2019s robust campaign pushed the GOP further right, modeling the \u201cSouthern Strategy\u201d \u2013 no to busing, racial integration of schools and neighborhoods, social welfare, racial justice and taxes \u2013 that would become the Republican Party\u2019s hallmark until the rise of Donald Trump galvanized racially motivated, politicized denials of reality as the party\u2019s most defining characteristic. Even Wallace, who ran for governor successfully, for a fourth term in 1982, admitted that his pro-segregation past had been a \u201cmistake,\u201d and was elected with support from Black voters in Alabama who gave him a second chance. Senator says he's 'glad' Biden went a 'little too far' in voting rights speech Response to Biden\u2019s remarks, particularly his use of history, was swift: Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell called it \u201cincoherent\u201d and \u201cbeneath his (Biden\u2019s) office,\u201d while Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois called it \u201cstark\u201d and suggested that some felt it \u201cwent a little too far.\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said of the president\u2019s question that \u201che was not comparing them as humans, he was comparing the choice to those figures in history,\u201d and Vice President Kamala Harris pushed back against GOP criticism, saying that Biden \u201ccompared this time to a previous time in our history, which is apt for comparison.\u201d But what\u2019s striking about Biden\u2019s historical gauntlet \u2013 and the response to it \u2013 are some of the other comparisons he made in his speech. He didn\u2019t just contrast Martin Luther King Jr. with George Wallace; he contrasted civil rights activist and congressional legend John Lewis with Birmingham law enforcement official Bull Connor, known for ordering the brutal use of violence against peaceful demonstrators in the 1960s. He contrasted President Abraham Lincoln with Confederate Jefferson Davis. In doing so, Biden\u2019s speech put front and center how far we have come since the civil rights era and how long the road ahead is. By invoking both civil rights and Civil War era conflicts over racism as integral to 21st-century voting rights, Biden acknowledged that no aspect of America\u2019s history on matters of race is separate or divisible from what came before it. The White moderates MLK warned us about Of all the names Biden invoked, perhaps the most telling was Strom Thurmond \u2013 former governor of South Carolina, longtime US Senator and failed presidential candidate. Like Thurmond, some of the most strident past opponents of voting rights for Black Americans, southern Democrats \u2013 nicknamed \u201cDixiecrats\u201d for their advocacy of racial segregation and the denial of Black citizenship \u2013 came, over time, to support congressional extension of the voting rights protections. Thurmond was once of the most vociferous proponents of racial segregation in postwar America. In fact, Thurmond led the segregationist forces who marched out of the 1948 Democratic Party convention in opposition to the strong civil rights platform. Thurmond ran for president that year \u2013 in a four-way race against incumbent Harry S. Truman, Republican Thomas Dewey and progressive Henry Wallace \u2013 on a states\u2019 rights ticket. In 1957, Sen. Thurmond staged an over 24-hour long filibuster against a Civil Rights Bill that, despite being passed, contained virtually no provisions that would end racial segregation or enforce voting rights. He did this on principle alone, and to send a message to supporters of civil rights. Yet over the ensuing decades, Thurmond, according to Biden, came to support voting rights during his later years in the Senate. For all its limitations, his was still an extraordinary transformation, one that seemed impossible in Thurmond\u2019s own time and \u2013 mind-bogglingly \u2013 seems even more impossible to imagine today. Is Biden's presidency doomed? Indeed, as late as 2006, when Congress passed a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act, the Senate voted 98-0 in support. Even in 1965 when the VRA was originally passed, 30 Republicans voted for it, along with 49 Democrats. Even after political realignment occurred in the wake of the civil rights revolution of the 1960s the nation\u2019s political center held enough to enable bipartisan support for voting rights. Yet in 2022, not a single Republican senator has expressed willingness to support the John Lewis Act, a piece of legislation that would help restore the political status quo on voting access the country experienced between 1965-2013, until the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Shelby County v. Holder gutted key provisions of the Voting Rights Act. Two Democratic senators, West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema, have expressed support for voting rights but an unwillingness to tinker with the filibuster rules (which, as Barack Obama reminds us, remain a relic of the Jim Crow era) to allow a vote to take place.  In essence the Republican Party in 2022 resembles, in troubling ways, Dixiecrats of yesteryear, a party so extreme that it stands in contrast to the eventual political moderation on voting rights displayed by Strom Thurmond and George Wallace. The GOP represents a firewall against the basic and normal functioning of American democracy, one whose power exceeds that of its political forbears in ways that threaten the nation\u2019s most hallowed institutions. This is surely one main reason why Biden, who served in the United States Senate from 1973-2009, looked to history to try and change hearts and minds in the run up to a political and legislative battle that may decide the future of American democracy \u2013 as well as his own chances for reelection in 2024.",

View more opinion at CNN. \u201cI have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro\u2019s great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizens Councilor or the Ku Klux Klanner but the White moderate who is more devoted to \u2018order\u2019 than to justice.\u201d In 1963, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote these words in the isolation of a Birmingham jail, where he was imprisoned for defying a court injunction to protest the city\u2019s segregation ordinance. In an open letter, initially scrawled in the margins of a newspaper, Dr. King addressed a group of fellow clergymen who claimed to support the Black freedom movement but criticized nonviolent civil disobedience as a tactic to confront the evils of segregation. In the letter, King differentiated between just and unjust laws, citing measures that prevented Black Americans from voting as a form of legalized injustice. At the time, Alabama, like many states across the South, was governed by a kind of racial authoritarianism that denied Black people a say in how they were governed. The clergymen\u2019s condemnation of King\u2019s activism belied their stated commitment to racial justice and provided cover for the denial of basic citizenship rights, including the right to vote. By blocking voting reform today, Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are the White moderates Dr. King warned us about. On Thursday, Sinema said that while she backs the Democrats\u2019 voting rights laws, she would not support an exception to the filibuster\u2019s 60-vote threshold to pass the legislation. Manchin later followed suit, saying he would not vote to \u201celiminate or weaken the filibuster.\u201d By prioritizing an arcane Senate rule over the protection of voting rights, Manchin and Sinema have chosen \u201corder\u201d over justice. The clergymen Dr. King addressed in his letter similarly elevated procedural and strategic complaints over the urgent need for racial equality, even though city officials in Birmingham secured an injunction against civil rights demonstrations and were negotiating with civil rights activists in bad faith. By claiming the movement should continue negotiating with those who were unified in their opposition to racial progress, the clergymen were effectively siding with segregation and suborning Black rights to White whims. My grandfather taught me this crucial life lesson Manchin and Sinema\u2019s procedural complaints about the filibuster are reminiscent of the clergymen Dr. King was confronting. Manchin has expressed his concerns that  an exception for voting rights legislation would lead to a slippery slope of rule changes. But he fails to grasp that disenfranchisement creates another slippery slope for those who are denied ballot access \u2013 a more dangerous one that allows their other rights to be more easily abridged. Sinema says she is similarly worried that changing the filibuster would erode Americans\u2019 faith in government and increase political division. But what is a greater threat to faith in government than being denied the right to vote? Together, these senators\u2019 stance conveniently ignores the fact that Republicans and Democrats have changed Senate rules when it serves their political agenda. Mitch McConnell changed the filibuster in 2017, paving the way for three conservative Supreme Court Justices to be confirmed with simple majorities. Democrats also changed the rules in 2013, moving to eliminate the filibuster for most presidential nominations. Given that both parties have shown their willingness to change the Senate rules to reach their goals, Manchin and Sinema\u2019s refusal prioritizes fealty to the filibuster over minority voting rights. Fidelity to anti-democratic procedures that target minority rights is always reprehensible. But this is especially true when the United States faces an assault on voting rights that hasn\u2019t been seen since the end of Reconstruction. Sen. Reverend Warnock of Georgia, an intellectual and spiritual heir to Dr. King as a pastor at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, has laid out the stakes for months, noting the filibuster protects Republican senators\u2019 minority rights while those same senators block the rights of minority voters. Warnock also noted, in a bipartisan move, senators used a filibuster carve out to raise the debt ceiling in December, but were unwilling to do so for basic democratic rights. The alarming prospect raised by the Supreme Court rulings Even the events of January 6th, 2021, haven\u2019t been enough to convince Republicans of the need for voting and electoral reforms. Commentators disagree if the attack on the Capitol was an insurrection, an attempted coup, an uprising or a riot. But experts increasingly warn the threat to our multiracial democracy has only increased since the attack on the Capitol. Following January 6th, many congressional Republicans have refused to break with former President Donald Trump and call out his lies about election fraud for fear of retaliation. Fearful of electoral repercussions and with no legislative agenda going into the 2022 midterms, Republicans seem preoccupied instead on securing their power by gaining an unfair advantage through voter restriction laws. Even Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, who has spoken out against Trump\u2019s \u201cbig lie,\u201d has shied away from criticizing voter restriction laws Republican-led state legislatures have passed, casting it instead as a state\u2019s rights approach to voting that empowers the very anti-democratic forces she claims to oppose. In 2021, more than 440 bills that include provisions that restrict voting access were introduced in 49 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Many of these voting procedure changes came about after a decades-long campaign to push back against voting rights. There was the Southern Strategy, which used neutral-sounding \u201ccolorblind\u201d rhetoric and policy to turn back civil rights movement gains and target the Voting Rights Act. Then in 2013, the Supreme Court overturned a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required states to receive clearance from the Justice Department or a federal court in Washington before making changes to voting procedures. This cleared the way for the current wave of voter suppression. Is Biden's presidency doomed? Republican voters have also taken an anti-democratic turn. Only 28% of Republican voters \u2013 stoked by a conservative media infrastructure rife with misinformation \u2013 believe Biden\u2019s 2020 win was legitimate. Republicans\u2019 assault on democratic norms hasn\u2019t stopped at state level attempts to undermine voting rights; they have also attacked local voting administration. Conspiracy theories about election irregularities and in-person voter fraud inspired a crop of conservative activists to run for election administration roles at the state and local levels. It didn\u2019t help that some officials who were committed to fair elections were subject to a number of violent threats after Trump repeatedly spread lies about election fraud. Understandably, in the face of these threats, some officials have chosen to step down rather than put themselves and their families at further risk. The voting rights bills Manchin and Sinema are blocking would help to alleviate some of the most egregious problems with the country\u2019s current anti-Democratic push. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would update provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act weakened by the Supreme Court, once again requiring preclearance for potentially-discriminatory election changes. The Freedom to Vote Act would expand voting access by, among other things, establishing minimum periods of early voting and making Election Day a national holiday. These reforms are non-partisan, and it appears Republican opposition is based on the recognition that democracy itself hurts the party\u2019s electoral chances. America\u2019s multiracial democracy is a recent, and fragile invention. Dr. King was, after all, protesting for the protection of rights supposedly guaranteed by the 15th Amendment but denied for nearly a century through anti-democratic schemes that barred Black Americans from voting. The passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act finally guaranteed Black voting rights and led to dramatic increases in both voting and substantive representation. But conservatives on the Supreme Court have substantially undermined that law and now voting rights are once again under attack by Republicans in a bid to maintain and secure power.  Manchin and Sinema\u2019s claim they want a bipartisan solution to voting rights is, at best, a refusal to face political reality. At worst, their so-called moderate position of defending the filibuster gives cover to an anti-democratic extremism reminiscent of many of the worst moments in American history. To paraphrase Dr. King, by choosing order over justice, they remain the nation\u2019s great stumbling block in the stride toward a fully inclusive democracy. \u201cVoting Rights: A Continued Fight for the Ballot\u201d is hosted by CITIZEN by CNN on Wednesday, January 19 at 2pm ET.

The grim determination on his face reminded me of the 1976 Pulitzer Prize-winning photo \u201cThe Soiling of Old Glory.\u201d In it, a White man is poised to drive the pole of an American flag into the midsection of a Black civil rights lawyer held fast by another White man. The photo is from the year of our nation\u2019s bicentennial, and technically the unrest it depicts was over busing. But really, it was over democracy: who is part of it; who is excluded; and who gets to tell its story. When I think of the many children at the rally, I think of photos from earlier eras where lynching was a family-friendly event and watching a man or woman burn was cause for a picnic. Today, we may be watching democracy burn instead. I\u2019ve been saying that publicly for the past two years, and it seemed at first that many people seemed to think I was way off base. Field reporting and social science research led me to understand the level of threat, something that now, as we mark the anniversary of the violence at the US Capitol, more and more Americans are starting to grasp \u2013 even as a recalcitrant cohort attempt to ignore or deny it. Here are a few thoughts on what we missed, and three ways that those of us who work in journalism, data gathering and civil society can deepen the ways we understand and tell the story of this nation. January 6 may have just been a dress rehearsal First, think of active extremists as fellow Americans, because that\u2019s who they are. I treat them with the same approach to fact-finding and deep listening that I give any other interview subject. I had a moment early in my career where I interviewed a woman from the Aryan Nation by phone, and she said, \u201cFor every 10 people who read your article, one of them will follow me.\u201d I didn\u2019t take her words at face value, but they both scared and intrigued me. When journalism and civic discourse treat extremists as an other, large swaths of society fail to comprehend their ubiquity \u2013 or their connections to fundamental issues and institutions. America has been so eager to consider itself \u201cpost-racial\u201d that we papered over the growing antipathy to multiracial democracy, saying it \u201cwasn\u2019t the America we knew.\u201d Such attempts to explain away racial animus emboldened extremists and led us to where we are today. But the connections are there, and we have to face them. For example, I have looked at the ways that organized extremist movements sought to foster people who were also displaced by crises of mental health and over labor, particularly in regions where blue collar White Democrats had once been well paid. I corresponded with one White nationalist for more than a year over Twitter DMs. I learned a lot, including that like so many of us he\u2019d dealt with depression and alienation. How I felt seeing guys like me at the Capitol riot I talked to military members and veterans, mainly off the record and frankly. My own family\u2019s record of service goes back generations, to the Civil War. My cousin, who is a mixed-race man who people \u201cread\u201d as White, told me about the unfiltered commentary he heard from White troop members about race and politics. A Black veteran described serving with men with strange square black tattoos, which he found out were inked-in swastikas, and learning to forge a working relationship with them anyway. I noted the rise of White supremacy within the ranks of troops and officers. I talked to Chris Jones of the award-winning outlet \u201c100 Days in Appalachia\u201d about how extremist movements foreground veterans to attract other members. (He is a veteran himself.) Second, we need better data that goes further than traditional political polling in getting to the root causes behind citizens\u2019 actions. A great example is \u201cUnderstanding the 2020 Election, the Electorate, and the Trump Years,\u201d by the firm PerryUndem from April 2021. In it, pollster Tresa Undem included a cluster of questions collectively measuring \u201cperceived threat to white male cultural and political dominance.\u201d Among White male voters, this index explained voter choice almost as much as party ID, and with more nuance. But almost no one wrote about the poll, although other surveys by the firm have made headlines. I suspect that the findings were considered impolite and alienating to the perceived neutrality of journalism. You know what: Sometimes reality is impolite. A survey like this, which also oversampled for voters of color, is far more contextually useful than quick (and increasingly inaccurate) predictive election polls. If Congress won't protect democracy, Americans must I believe there are better options. At the radio show I host, \u201cOur Body Politic,\u201d we have a partnership with the Gen Forward Survey of the National Opinion Research Center. Data scientists Jenn Jackson and Diane Wong take a community-informed approach to data so they ask deeper intersectional questions. For example, a recent survey found that Black women and Latinas were delaying life events like marriage, home buying and having children due to college debt. That data provides information on understanding the issue of the racial wealth gap, how it affects intergenerational wealth, and the fiscal cracks in the American Dream. I plan to do more research this year in partnership with different data scientists and pollsters to not only learn how to tell the story of America better and more accurately, but also what demographic and psychographic factors affect our preference for and ability to champion pluralistic multiracial democracy. Third, if it hasn\u2019t become clear yet, we need to be prepared to live in psychic discomfort over the state of American democracy, and do so indefinitely. Just as we are learning to adapt to the pandemic, to the fatiguing array of choices we face under pain of death or illness, we can learn to adapt to an America where we have to face threats to democracy head on. And here, really, is where we have the chance to grow as a nation. Many of us, myself included, have not led lives where phrases like \u201cthis isn\u2019t the America I know\u201d came to mind on January 6. Quite the opposite.  It\u2019s hard to grow up Black in America and not see threats to democracy, because we have to face them at younger ages and more consistently than many White Americans do. I love this country, but whatever bubble of thought that I had that it would protect my interests without fail burst long ago, in childhood. Interestingly, but perhaps not surprisingly, I find it easier to talk to White Americans who grew up poor or working-income, particularly outside of major cities, about the challenge facing democracy than people who grew up more financially privileged. We can begin to recognize that some among us \u2013 from many backgrounds \u2013 have more familiarity with the failings of American democracy than others, and recognize that not as bias but as expertise. We will need our collective civic competency to navigate this moment in history. That\u2019s one reason the photograph \u201cThe Soiling of Old Glory\u201d sticks with me. It shows us an America we don\u2019t generally want to see, in the service of helping us create something better. I personally remember that bicentennial year of 1976, when I was in first grade, and watching my mother hoist the flag above our house in Baltimore. I hope America reaches its next centennial, and does so with reasons to celebrate. Whether it does or not is up to us.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Two opposing historical forces have the power to shape American democracy in 2022. These worldviews took shape in the aftermath of the Civil War and have, ever since, undergirded America\u2019s legal and legislative systems, national policies on voting rights and criminal justice and our understanding (or, at times, denial of) of historical memory since 1865. Centuries later, Americans exist between these two 19th-century poles \u2013 reconstructionist and redemptionist \u2013 and their opposition deepens the 21st-century social fractures confronting us about everything from classroom curricula to voting rights to the notion of truth itself. Understanding the deep roots of these contemporary conflicts is crucial to any effort in 2022 and beyond to thwart their toxic effects on US politics \u2013 and the lives of everyday Americans. The racial and political reckoning of 2020, one that spilled over into 2021, played out in large part based on the framework of American democracy that came into being during the Reconstruction period. That\u2019s because the clash between the reconstructionist and redemptionist perspectives was, at its heart, a battle over the story we told the world and each other, about ourselves and our country. That battle continues and will likely define the politics of 2022. Reconstructionism grew from the effort to interpret the period after the Civil War as a second American Founding. Abraham Lincoln said as much during his famous Gettysburg Address in 1863; the war, he explained in a mere 270 words, would give America \u201ca new birth of freedom.\u201d Reconstructionists embraced the potential in these words to achieve a new country based on multiracial democracy \u2013 long before the modern civil rights movement in the 20th century. A Confederate flag at the Capitol summons America's demons Historians sometimes refer to the violent racial backlash that followed as Redemption. The \u201credeemer\u201d South, populated by vengeful ex-Confederates and a resentful White working-class, vowed to reject any hint of Black equality and regarded Reconstruction as a political and moral disaster. Over time, from the late 19th century until the 1960s, and with a reach that carried well into the 20th century in ways that are still visible today, they successfully reshaped American memory regarding the cause of the Civil War. They enshrined myths and lies of Southern nobility into history textbooks, films, and popular culture \u2013 and found willing allies (first in the Democratic Party) in the Republican Party of the late 1960s who, in pursuit of economic greed and political stability, betrayed the struggle for Black equality they had once supported. They did so at the expense of the nation\u2019s soul \u2013 and this struggle continues to play out in our own time. It\u2019s happened quite literally in the public square. Monuments in praise of the Confederacy that sought to forever render Black Americans inferior \u2013 themselves erected in a concerted effort to fashion communities in a redemptionist image \u2013 took on new dimensions of complexity in the shadow of protests following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Likewise, BLM activists\u2019 call to \u201cdefund the Police\u201d were rooted in a Reconstruction-era criminal justice system that targeted Black people for punishment and whose determinations of Black criminality helped to facilitate the grotesque system of mass incarceration that America has today. The amendment that abolished slavery had a lasting flaw These Reconstructionist efforts to end the criminalization of Black bodies, in part by telling a fuller history of how racism shaped the creation of American law enforcement, clashed in 2021 with redemptionist attacks on teaching this history at all. The national controversy over so-called Critical Race Theory and how America\u2019s history of racism should be taught in our classrooms grew louder, even as physical manifestations of redemptionism \u2013 Confederate monuments and symbols that dot the nation\u2019s built environment \u2013 were removed. Late in 2021, news that the Robert E. Lee statue in Charlottesville, Virginia \u2013 the one that helped to spark the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in 2017 whose violence may forever mar that city\u2019s landscape \u2013 will be repurposed as a work of art helped to illustrate the as-yet-unfinished reckoning with the legacy of the Confederacy. That rally left one woman dead and recriminations that reached all the way back to the White House, where Trump infamously proclaimed that there \u201cwere good people\u201d on both sides. This Lee statue, one of many erected in tribute to the Confederate General who famously surrendered to Union Chief Ulysses S. Grant outside the Appomattox Courthouse in Virginia in April 1865, will be transformed by a local African American heritage center into a piece of public art that affirms, rather than denigrates, the ongoing search for racial justice in America. Another Lee statue in Richmond, Virginia, the headquarters of the Old Confederacy, has been removed with the statue and its enormous pedestal scheduled for transfer to the city\u2019s Black History Museum. The Lee statue will become part of a public art effort, Swords into Plowshares, designed to transform symbols of racial hatred into evocative works of public memorial. The House takes a revealing vote on Confederate statues This has already occurred in Richmond, where, two miles from the place where the statue of Lee once stood, a new \u201cEmancipation and Freedom Monument\u201d consisting of two 12-foot bronze statues has been erected. This public art display, in contrast to symbols of the Confederacy, memorializes and celebrates the abolition of slavery and the resilience of the Black family symbolized by the statues of a man, woman, and infant child. These efforts at repurposing memorials and symbols related to America\u2019s history of racial violence is part of a larger process that may lead to national healing. Consider the recent efforts to atone for a massacre and coup d\u2019etat that took place in Wilmington, North Carolina in 1898 and left hundreds dead \u2013 a brutal imposition of White political rule after the progress of Reconstruction. On November 10, 2021, 123 years later, the city buried Joshua Halsey, a Black man shot 14 times and buried in an unmarked grave. Researchers uncovered his remains, and while the 47-year-old father of four never lived to see an America not threatened by his dreams, his descendants \u2013 some of whom were in attendance at his funeral, along with some of Wilmington\u2019s residents and local leaders \u2013 might.  Wilmington\u2019s and the nation\u2019s shame in this remarkable instance turned into an opportunity for shared mourning across color lines and political divisions. \u201cThere are so many people in our community who had no clue,\u201d Linda Thompson, the chief diversity and equity officer for New Hanover County (where Wilmington is located) told the New York Times. \u201cThey are certainly trying, wanting to know more.\u201d Such an example offers a path forward toward the creation of a new politics that is not held hostage by the continual stranglehold of ancient grievances. After the grotesque display of violence, privilege and racism at the US Capitol during the January 6 insurrection, those who insisted \u201cthis is not who we are\u201d were not entirely incorrect. The wildly unhinged (and modern-day redemptionist) attempts to overturn a federal election and to minimize the ongoing threats to our democracy for that purpose are not all of who we are. The ongoing battle between reconstructionists and redemptionists will shape American politics in 2022 and beyond. Whether they are the backdrop to the anniversary of January 6, the challenges confronting the Biden-Harris administration or the GOP\u2019s anticipated success in the midterm elections, these competing worldviews continue, for better and worse, to forge our national identity. But they do not predetermine our destiny unless we let them.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Black History Month is more important to the future of American democracy than ever. At a critical time, it offers the nation a window into its own soul \u2013 if we are only courageous enough to look. What gazes back at us is not just the past, but a way of better understanding the political, economic and social ills that plague us. The racial disparities so terribly evident in the Covid-19 pandemic and the most divisive presidential election in American history are rooted in circumstances that can best be explained, analyzed and interrogated through the lens of Black history. Last year\u2019s historic Black Lives Matter demonstrations proved to be the most potentially transformative social justice movement in American history. The massive numbers of White Americans who joined the protests inspired rounds of soul searching in virtually all sectors of American society. Luminaries connected to sports, technology, business, politics, and the arts publicly acknowledged the existence of systemic racism, admitted their own culpability in structures of racial justice, and vowed to do better in word and deed. The millions of Americans from all backgrounds who gathered around the nation in support of BLM protests after the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor helped to shatter the longstanding disconnect between contemporary racial injustice and the deep-seated historical roots behind our current national crisis of race and democracy. The protests offered Americans of all generations a chance to participate in the kinds of dramatic historical moments one usually reads about or watches in movies or hears about retrospectively. The sea of White faces in the streets, often times outnumbering Black demonstrators in states such as Washington, Utah and Oregon, signaled to the nation that this time was different. Why I'm asking for more from this Black History Month Black history spans the world, with Black folk always finding themselves at the cutting edge of human rights movements domestically and internationally. The Black Lives Matter Movement\u2019s recent nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, echoes the civil rights movement\u2019s heroic period, when a 35-year-old Martin Luther King Jr. accepted the award on behalf of the movement. Such international recognition of BLM as part of a human rights struggle has come only in the aftermath of critics who falsely labeled the group as violent, subversive and un-American. Black politics has been transformed from the bottom up through roiling street demonstrations that have demanded accountability within and outside of the civil rights community. BLM has been arguably the biggest shaper of Black history over the past year. But as the Nobel Prize nomination suggests, Black history shapes wider domestic and international currents of political transformation. Black history is a story of heartbreakingly stark juxtapositions. In January, racial progress could be seen in the historic victory of Rev. Raphael Warnock to the US Senate from Georgia, the first Black person elected from the peach state. Warnock\u2019s victory was orchestrated by the organizing prowess, political resilience, and indefatigable will of a Black community led by women such as Stacey Abrams. In nearly the same breath, the January 6 assault on the US Capitol showed the entire world, in stark detail, the White supremacist underside of American democracy that, historically has only been most visible to Black people. Biden: Capitol attack 'one of the darkest days' in US history January highlighted Black history\u2019s centrality to America\u2019s future in poignant and powerful ways. While many were stunned at the spectacle of violence in Washington, DC, students of Black history were not. There is perhaps no better time to acknowledge that Black history is more than just a narrative of the passage of time from slavery to freedom. It is a living argument about why the struggle for Black citizenship and dignity remains the beating heart of American democracy. That over 400-year struggle is receiving unprecedent amounts of attention in popular and political culture. Black history books chronicling the nation\u2019s brutal racial past and its connection to the present have stayed atop best sellers lists since last year. \u201c400 Souls,\u201d an anthology described by editors Ibram X. Kendi and Keisha N. Blain as a \u201ccommunity history\u201d of Black America since 1619, came out the second day of this month and is already one of the most acclaimed books of the year. The urgent question posed by 'One Night in Miami' A new generation of movies and actors are garnering attention for exploring the panoramic nature of the Black experience in film. From the riveting \u201cOne Night in Miami,\u201d which dramatizes the real life 1964 meet of four icons through a searing conversation between Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, Jim Brown and a 22-year-old Cassius Clay shortly before becoming Muhammad Ali, to \u201cJudas and the Black Messiah,\u201d the story of FBI informant William O\u2019Neal\u2019s role in organizing the police killing of Chicago Black Panther Fred Hampton in 1969, the politics of Black liberation in America are receiving new and intense public scrutiny on screen. This interest has been global in scope, as witnessed by the extraordinary reception to director Steve McQueen\u2019s \u201cSmall Axe\u201d series, which documents the Black Afro-British diasporic experience in London in stirring and historically resonant ways. January 6\u2019s violence recalled two earlier periods marked by racial progress and violent setbacks: Reconstruction and the civil rights era. Both moments birthed new freedoms for Black Americans that were met with violent White backlash that future generations have attempted to scrub from national and collective memory. This Black History Month is different precisely because we are in the midst of another national convulsion over race and democracy, another tortured struggle over the prospect of finally recognizing that Black lives matter. Our reckoning on racial justice, newfound interest in anti-racism and recognition of the value of Black history and culture for the future of democracy is long overdue. Just as important is the searing self-examination prompted by our violent divisions; looking inward could potentially help us confront longstanding racial inequality by facing our history rather than ignoring or worse, lying about it.  The possibilities for renewed focus on teaching Black history in schools, the public recognition of the roots of contemporary racial division, the moral responsibility of addressing the afterlives of racial slavery (lynching, Jim Crow segregation, mass incarceration and more) make this Black History Month more than just a weeks-long trip down memory lane. The future of our democratic experiment requires all of us to step up and into this history. Only by embracing the rough and smooth edges of that history, the joy and pain and trauma of our shared Black history, will America ever be able to go down the road toward racial truth, justice, and healing. The bitter irony of the American experiment in the 21st century is that its final hope lies in coming to terms with its original sin by excavating the totality of a national history that continues to shape our present.",

            "article_content": "Los Angeles City Council member Nury Martinez resigned from her seat on Council District 6, two days after stepping down from her post as president for making racist remarks. \u201cTo my constituents - Serving you has been a privilege and one that I don\u2019t give up lightly. You are my neighbors, my friends, and the reason for this service,\u201d Martinez said, in part, in a Wednesday news release. \u201cI hope you stay engaged and continue to fight for your fair share of the city\u2019s resources. It\u2019s hard to say goodbye, but please know that I was in this fight for you.\u201d \u201cWhile I take the time to look inwards and reflect, I ask that you give me space and privacy,\u201d the news release ended. CNN has reached out to Martinez\u2019s office to inquire if her resignation is effective immediately. Los Angeles City Council president resigns from leadership role after audio leaked of her racist remarks Her resignation comes days after audio posted online revealed she made racist comments about another council member\u2019s family and said that colleague\u2019s son \u201cneeds a beatdown.\u201d The remarks were part of leaked audio that was posted anonymously on Reddit and obtained by the Los Angeles Times. According to the newspaper, the audio details a conversation between Martinez, Councilmembers Gil Cedillo and Kevin de Le\u00f3n and Los Angeles County Federation of Labor President Ron Herrera, who resigned from his post Monday. Martinez publicly apologized for her comments Monday and resigned from her post as council president. On Tuesday, she also took a leave of absence from the council. Acting Council President Mitch O\u2019Farrell called Martinez\u2019s resignation on Wednesday \u201cthe first, necessary step\u201d toward accountability and called on de Le\u00f3n and Cedillo to also resign. \u201cThere is no other way forward,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said in a statement. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti called the resignation the \u201cright decision,\u201d adding that \u201cracism and hateful words cannot ever be overlooked.\u201d The mayor also called for the two other council members to make the same decision. California Gov. Gavin Newsom also called the resignation the \u201cright move,\u201d saying her comments \u201chave no place in our state, or in our politics, and we must all model better behavior to live the values that so many of us fight every day to protect.\u201d O\u2019Farrell designated Sharon Tso, the city\u2019s chief legislative analyst (CLA), as caretaker for Martinez\u2019s district, effective immediately. O\u2019Farrell said in a statement he will look into a special election to fill Martinez\u2019s seat. \u201cCaretaker\u201d is a non-voting role designed to \u201censure that the office continues to operate and that matters important to constituents are handled,\u201d he said. A day earlier, O\u2019Farrell had proposed several changes to help move the city forward during a loud and contentious council meeting \u2013 the first meeting since the scandal broke. He proposed \u201cmajor reform of the city charter, city council and how we approach redistricting, representation \u2013 the topics at the center of this crisis\u201d and called for expanding the council and an independent redistricting commission to map out representation of the \u201cdiverse metropolis.\u201d Los Angeles City Council member takes leave and labor union leader resigns amid scandal involving racist remarks O\u2019Farrell presented a motion for a ballot measure that could be posed to voters to decide if the council should grow. The number of members \u2013 15 \u2013 has not changed since 1925, when Los Angeles had less than 1 million residents, O\u2019Farrell said. The city\u2019s population has since quadrupled, according to US Census data. \u201cThis council should reflect and represent the residents we serve,\u201d O\u2019Farrell said. \u201cA ballot measure that increases the number of council seats to help us meet that goal and involve Angelenos in the process, as will an immediate redistricting process, should the people decide they want an expanded city council.\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Wednesday announced an investigation into the city\u2019s redistricting process. Calling it \u201cfoundational to our democracy,\u201d Bonta insisted the process \u201cmust be above reproach.\u201d Bonta said the investigation \u201ccould lead to criminality,\u201d and \u201cthere\u2019s certainly the potential for civil liability based on civil rights and voting rights laws here in the state of California.\u201d When the council reconvenes, members will discuss another ballot measure that calls for an independent redistricting commission that would determine the boundaries set every 10 years. A city council meeting that was originally scheduled for Wednesday was delayed until Friday, O\u2019Farrell announced. The meeting was moved after the council lost a quorum \u2013 a required 10 of 15 members \u2013 due to protesters who interrupted and chanted, \u201cNo resignation, no meeting\u201d and, \u201cStand down or we shut down.\u201d According to The Los Angeles Times, the leaked audio captured conversation from October 2021 involving Martinez, Cedillo, de Le\u00f3n and Herrera. Racist remarks by Los Angeles City Council president overshadow years of work toward solidarity, experts say Much of the conversation focused on maps proposed by the city\u2019s redistricting commission and the councilmembers\u2019 frustration with them, as well as the need to \u201censure that heavily Latino districts did not lose economic assets\u201d in the once-in-a-decade process, according to the Times. The councilmembers then discussed Councilmember Mike Bonin, a White man. In clips of the leaked audio posted by the Times, Martinez is heard recounting a conversation and says \u201cBonin thinks he\u2019s f**king Black.\u201d According to the Times, Martinez says Bonin appeared with his son on a float in a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade and he \u201chandled his young Black son as though he were an accessory.\u201d The boy is 8 years old, according to a Facebook post by his father. The Times reported that Martinez also said of Bonin\u2019s child, \u201cParece changuito,\u201d or \u201cHe\u2019s like a monkey.\u201d In the leaked audio, Martinez can be heard talking about Bonin\u2019s son allegedly misbehaving while at the parade by hanging from a railing of their float, saying \u201cthis kid is going to tip us over.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re raising him like a little White kid,\u201d Martinez said in the audio released by The Times. \u201cI was like, this kid needs a beatdown. Let me take him around the corner and then I\u2019ll bring him back.\u201d CNN has not been able to verify the audio recording. But the fallout has been swift. Councilmember Cedillo issued a public statement saying he should have stepped in during the conversation. \u201cI want to start by apologizing. While I did not engage in the conversation in question, I was present at times during this meeting last year,\u201d Cedillo said Sunday. \u201cIt is my instinct to hold others accountable when they use derogatory or racially divisive language. Clearly, I should have intervened.\u201d Biden believes LA city council members who took part in racist conversation should 'step down,' press secretary says Councilmember de Le\u00f3n also said he should have acted differently. \u201cOn that day, I fell short of the expectations we set for our leaders \u2013 and I will hold myself to a higher standard,\u201d he said in a written statement Sunday. \u201cThere were comments made in the context of this meeting that are wholly inappropriate; and I regret appearing to condone and even contribute to certain insensitive comments made about a colleague and his family in private. I\u2019ve reached out to that colleague personally.\u201d Officials near and far \u2013 including Sen. Dianne Feinstein and President Joe Biden \u2013 believe the councilmembers who took part in the recorded conversation should resign. \u201cAt a time when our country has seen a steep rise in racially motivated hate crimes, it\u2019s critical that elected officials set a positive example on behalf of everyone they represent,\u201d said Feinstein, the senior US senator from California. A motion to elect a new council president will be heard next Tuesday. CNN\u2019s Paul Vercammen, Camila Bernal, Sarah Moon, Stella Chan and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

April 11, 2018 - A bipartisan group of senators introduces legislation that would make it harder for Mueller to be fired.

For the first time, prosecutors endorse Cohen\u2019s statements that Trump himself directed Cohen to make payments designed to silence women who claimed affairs with Trump. Separately, Manafort is alleged to have lied after agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, including his \u201ccontact with administration officials.\u201d Despite the revelations in the filings, Trump tweets after their release, \u201cTotally clears the President. Thank you!\u201d January 25, 2019 - Trump associate Roger Stone is arrested and indicted on seven counts: one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements and one count of witness tampering. After he makes an initial appearance at a federal courthouse in Florida, he tells a crowd assembled outside that he has been falsely accused and he believes the charges are politically motivated. He says he will not testify against Trump. Protestors in the crowd chant, \u201cLock him up.\u201d Stone is later convicted and sentenced to 40-months in federal prison. March 7, 2019 - Manafort is sentenced to 47 months in prison for financial fraud convictions stemming from Mueller\u2019s investigation, though the crimes did not relate directly to Manafort\u2019s work as Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman. March 13, 2019 - Manafort is sentenced to an additional 43 months in prison related to conspiracy and obstruction charges. March 22, 2019 - Mueller ends his investigation and delivers his report to Attorney General William Barr. A senior Justice Department official tells CNN that there will be no further indictments. March 24, 2019 - Barr releases a letter summarizing the principal conclusions from Mueller\u2019s investigation. According to Barr\u2019s four-page letter, the evidence was not sufficient to establish that members of Trump\u2019s campaign tacitly engaged in a criminal conspiracy with the Russian government to interfere with the election. Barr explains that Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether the president committed a criminal obstruction of justice offense. While Mueller declined to prosecute Trump, the report \u201cdoes not exonerate\u201d the president, according to Barr. Ultimately, the attorney general and Rosenstein decided that the evidence was not sufficient to charge the president with obstruction, Barr writes. March 25, 2019 - Mueller writes a letter to Barr in response to the attorney general\u2019s summary of the special counsel\u2019s report. The letter contains an introduction and executive summaries marked with redactions for public release. March 27, 2019 - Mueller writes a second letter to Barr. In the note, Mueller asks the attorney general to release the special counsel team\u2019s redacted summaries of the report\u2019s findings. \u201cThe summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions,\u201d Mueller writes in the letter, which is later released to the public. March 31, 2019 - Barr sends another letter to Congress, declaring that his March 24 letter was being inaccurately characterized by the media as a \u201csummary\u201d of Mueller\u2019s report. \u201cMy letter was not, and did not purport to be, an exhaustive recounting of the Special Counsel\u2019s investigation or report,\u201d Barr writes. April 18, 2019 - A redacted version of Mueller\u2019s report is released. The first part of the 448-page document details the evidence gathered by Mueller\u2019s team on potential conspiracy crimes and explains their decisions not to charge individuals associated with the campaign. The second part of the report outlines ten episodes involving possible obstruction of justice by the president. According to the report, Mueller\u2019s decision not to charge Trump was rooted in Justice Department guidelines prohibiting the indictment of a sitting president. Mueller writes that he would have cleared Trump if the evidence warranted exoneration. May 29, 2019 - Mueller delivers a public statement, declaring that charging the president with a criminal offense was not a constitutional option. He says the special counsel\u2019s office is closing and he is returning to private life. July 24, 2019 - Mueller testifies before the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. He makes the point to the Judiciary panel that his investigation did not exonerate the President, but says he doesn\u2019t agree with Democrats that Trump\u2019s actions amounted to obstruction of justice. August 2, 2019 - According to newly released figures from the Justice Department, the Mueller investigation cost a total of almost $32 million through the course of the probe. July 10, 2020 - Stone is granted executive clemency by President Trump. The announcement comes just days before Stone was set to report to federal prison and serve his 40-month prison sentence. The following day Mueller pens an op-ed in the Washington Post saying Stone is still a convicted felon and \u201crightly so.\u201d June 2, 2021 - The University of Virginia Law School announces that Mueller will help teach a class on his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection released more than 30 witness interview transcripts Wednesday from key figures who aided former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including the likes of conservative attorney John Eastman and one-time national security adviser Michael Flynn. While the transcripts largely confirm that most of these individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination during their interviews with the committee, a review of their complete testimony sheds some new light on the panel\u2019s closed-door depositions. Exclusive: Trump's former White House ethics lawyer told Cassidy Hutchinson to give misleading testimony to January 6 committee, sources say Several of the witnesses whose transcripts were released in full Wednesday appeared in the committee\u2019s report summary that was produced this week, which noted they largely refused to provide substantive answers to the panel\u2019s questions. But at the same time, the transcripts show how witnesses like Eastman and Flynn \u2013 both of whom pushed baseless claims about widespread election fraud \u2013 failed to provide the committee with any proof to validate their assertions. The transcripts obscure the names of House investigators conducting the interviews but do note when members of the panel ask a question. Here is what we learned from the newly released transcripts: Flynn asserted his Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination to nearly every question. Flynn did answer a series of initial questions about his background and military career, acknowledging for example that he joined a group called \u201cThe America Project,\u201d which was founded by former Overstock CEO and known election denier Patrick Byrne. He also answered when the committee asked if he knew the reason Trump pardoned him. \u201cBecause I think he saw my whole case as a travesty of justice,\u201d Flynn said, according to the transcript. But when asked why he failed to produce any documents pursuant to the committee\u2019s subpoena, Flynn invoked the Fifth Amendment, ultimately doing so for every other question during the course of his March deposition. Conservative lawyer Eastman \u2013 whose role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election has come under scrutiny by the January 6 committee, Department of Justice and state prosecutors in Georgia \u2013 invoked the Fifth Amendment to every question asked by the panel, the transcript of his testimony confirms. Eastman was asked about his role in efforts to overturn the election, including a series of legal memos he authored, meetings with former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s staff, and communications with lawmakers at every level, the transcript shows. He was also asked about his communications with Trump himself, but in every instance declined to answer. Roger Stone\u2019s interview with the select committee lasted 51 minutes and he took the Fifth Amendment with every question the panel asked him. Stone did not comment on anything the panel put in front of him including photographs, public statements, video clips of interviews and text messages. The select committee reveals text exchanges between Stone and \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally organizer Ali Alexander, who also was interviewed by the panel, from January 6 where the pair discuss logistics about the rallies that day. Despite these messages, Stone would not reveal who paid for his private flight from Florida to Washington, DC, in the days before January 6 or who paid for his hotel room at the Willard InterContinental, which is where Stone and other Trump allies set up what has been considered a war room on January 6. He also would not confirm which events he was invited to speak at on January 5 and 6, by whom, or if he even attended them at all. Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, whom Trump wanted to install as attorney general, stonewalled the committee over the course of two interviews. When Clark appeared for testimony the first time in November 2021, his lawyer presented to the committee a 12 page letter of objections, which, according to the transcript, included concerns about presidential communications privilege, law enforcement investigation privilege, deliberative process privilege and attorney-client privilege. Included with the letter was a vague letter from a Trump lawyer raising vague concerns about executive privilege. Members of the committee and its staff sparred at length with Clark\u2019s lawyer Harry MacDougald about not just the scope of the objections letter and whether the privilege concerns were legitimate, but also how to even handle the next steps. Clark occasionally chimed in on the legal debate, but answered only a single question of fact on a technical question about a Justice Department email address. When a committee staffer said the panel was going to take a recess to go over the objections letter more closely, Clark and his attorney said they were going to leave the deposition instead. They did so, despite being instructed by the committee to  stay while the recess was taken. During the second deposition, held in February 2022, Clark invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 120 times \u2013 including when asked if he had worked at the Justice Department on January 6, 2021. At the outset, his lawyer criticized committee members for suggesting an invocation of the Fifth was an admission of guilt. In a deposition with former Proud Boys Chairman Enrique Tarrio, committee investigators used public-sourced images and videos as well as private phone records and criminal court filings against other members of the Proud Boys, to ask about Tarrio\u2019s connections to other extremist groups, the former president and his allies. Investigators pushed Tarrio to explain who invited him to the White House in December (he said Latinos for Trump president Bianca Gracia) and how well he knew Stone (they were friendly). The committee investigators also used tweets and other quotes from Trump that referenced the January 6 rally and the Proud Boys, including his infamous \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d comment. \u201cI took it to be, like \u2018Hey, the election\u2019s coming up. Stand by,\u2019\u201d Tarrio said of the comment. \u201cI also believe that he meant it, like, \u2018Stand by me as the President,\u2019 like, I\u2019ve never failed \u2013 I think he was more telling that to, like, the American people too. Like I haven\u2019t failed you yet, so just stand behind me.\u201d Investigators also seemed particularly focused on who paid for Proud Boys to travel to and stay Washington, DC. Tarrio did not provide the committee any information about Proud Boys donors or finances. The committee\u2019s interview with Mike Roman \u2013 a senior adviser to Trump\u2019s reelection campaign and tasked with Election Day operations \u2013 helps shed light on a little-known campaign figure who has since come under scrutiny by the Justice Department. Roman invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination for the committee\u2019s questions about his efforts after the 2020 election. However, he did answer some of the committee\u2019s questions about his activities ahead of Election Day. Roman told investigators that when it came to former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, \u201cI don\u2019t believe I had any interaction with him before the election.\u201d But when asked about his interactions with Giuliani after Election Day, Roman said, \u201cOn the advice of counsel, I assert my constitutional privilege under the Fifth Amendment and respectfully decline to answer the question.\u201d When investigators asked Roman what his understanding was \u2013 before Election Day \u2013 of the role state legislatures play in choosing electoral college electors, Roman said, \u201cI was not focused on that.\u201d Evidence congressional investigators used to question Roman suggests that he later became involved in efforts to push fake slates of electors to help Trump win. Investigators asked Roman about one particular email in which Josh Findlay \u2013 who worked with the Trump campaign and went on to become the Republican National Committee\u2019s national director for election integrity \u2013 told a group of people that Roman had been designated to make sure the fake elector voting took place December 14. When investigators asked Roman about his role, Roman again pleaded the Fifth. He also invoked the Fifth Amendment when it came to questions about how the Trump campaign investigated allegations of voter fraud, efforts to seize voting machines, imposing martial law, and a number of other matters, according to his transcript. During Alexander Bruesewitz\u2019s deposition with the committee earlier this year, the political strategist declined to respond to questions from an investigator about a text GOP Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona sent to a \u201cStop the Steal DM chat\u201d the day of the insurrection. \u201cSo we\u2019re still on January 6, and it looks like at 5:15 p.m. ET. Again, Representative Gosar sends the group a direct message that says, \u2018We\u2019re still on lockdown in the congressional office,\u2019\u201d the investigator said, according to a transcript from the deposition. \u201cAnd he sends it to the entire Stop the Steal group. So were you in communications with Rep. Gosar throughout January 6?\u201d \u201cI respectfully plead the Fifth,\u201d Bruesewitz replied. He went on to invoke the Fifth again in response to a follow up question about why Gosar was \u201csharing that his office was on lockdown with this Stop the Steal group.\u201d CNN previously reported that \u201cStop the Steal\u201d leader Alexander had handed over to the committee thousands of text messages and communication records that include his interactions with members of Congress and Trump\u2019s inner circle leading up to the riot, including ones with Gosar. Nevada Republican Party chairman Michael McDonald, who served as a false elector for Trump, pleaded the 5th when asked about his plan to go in \u201cfull attack mode\u201d with the former president and his orbit. In a text message, McDonald wrote on November 4 that he \u201cwas on the phone to President, Mark Meadows, Giuliani and they want full attack mode. We\u2019re gonna have a war room meeting in about an hour in the bosses suite.\u201d In a separate thread that day, McDonald, when asked about a number of claims about irregularities related to the election results, texted, \u201cwe are on it. I have been on the phone this morning with the President, Eric Trump, Mark Meadows and Mayor Giuliani. There is a major plan. We are meeting at the hotel with attorneys and national staff in about 20 minutes.\u201d But when asked for specific details about these messages, McDonald repeatedly pleaded the 5th. The deposition reveals how the plan for false slates of electors unfolded in Nevada and the integral role that McDonald played in coordinating with Trump\u2019s campaign. New York lawyer Kenneth Chesebro initiated an email chain with a number of individuals, including McDonald, on December 10 saying, \u201cMayor Giyliani and others with the Trump-Pence campaign, including Justin Clark and Nick Trainer, asked me to reach out to you and the other Nevada electors to run point on the plan to have all Trump-Pence electors in all six contested States meet and transmit their votes to Congress on Monday, December 14th.\u201d Even before this email thread, McDonald on November 17 acknowledged in a text conversation that Giuliani \u201ctook over the investigation and legal fight for the President. There\u2019s more to come.\u201d That same day, McDonald was asked by an individual named Michael Bertrand if the Nevada Republican Party could join onto the Texas lawsuit after the Supreme Court brushed off their challenge, to which McDonald replied, \u201cwe are still pushing it, brother. I\u2019m waiting to hear back from Mayor Giuliani.\u201d When it came time to planning the meeting of the fake electors in Nevada on December 14, however, McDonald acknowledged that the Republican National Committee did not want the Nevada GOP to advertise their plans. Two individuals said of McDonald the day before the meeting that the Nevada GOP chairman \u201cwants a smaller group of us,\u201d was \u201cstressing the optics\u201d and was \u201cvery concerned RNC will cut cord if looks bad and steal credit if we do well.\u201d An individual in a separate thread that same day said of McDonald, \u201che\u2019s concerned that we look like foolish crybabies.\u201d McDonald would not elaborate on any of the text messages or emails the panel presented him with, nor would he share whether his conversations with members of the Trump campaign or whether he spoke with sitting members of Congress.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection is considering criminal referrals for at least four individuals in addition to former President Donald Trump, multiple sources told CNN. The panel is weighing criminal referrals for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, right wing lawyer John Eastman, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, the sources said. The committee has not officially decided whom to refer to the Justice Department for prosecution and for what offenses, sources said. The four individuals who are among those under consideration, and whose names have not been previously reported, provide a window into the panel\u2019s deliberations. Another source cautioned that while names are being considered, there is still discussion before names are finalized. While the criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature \u2013 as the DOJ has already undertaken a sprawling investigation into the US Capitol attack and efforts to overturn the 2020 election \u2013 committee members have stressed that the move serves as a way to document their views for the record. A spokesperson for the January 6 committee declined to comment. Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said Thursday that committee members are expected to reach a decision on criminal referrals when members meet virtually on Sunday. Thompson told reporters on Thursday how members evolved towards the idea of issuing criminal referrals as the panel\u2019s investigation went on. \u201cI think the more we looked at the body of evidence that we had collected, we just felt that while we\u2019re not in the business of investigating people for criminal activities, we just couldn\u2019t overlook some of them.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who leads the January 6 subcommittee tasked with presenting recommendations on criminal referrals to the full committee, said Thursday, \u201cI think anyone who engages in criminal actions needs to be held accountable for them. And we are going to spell that out.\u201d \u201cThe gravest offense in constitutional terms is the attempt to overthrow a presidential election and bypass the constitutional order,\u201d Raskin told reporters. \u201cSubsidiary to all of that are a whole host of statutory offenses, which support the gravity and magnitude of that violent assault on America.\u201d Raskin, along with Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, and the panel\u2019s vice chair GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, comprise the subcommittee. Schiff told CNN there is a \u201cconsensus among the members\u201d regarding referrals and that members are taking a unified approach on that front. Thompson told reporters earlier this week, \u201cwe will make referrals. As to how many, we\u2019ve not decided that yet.\u201d CNN previously reported that the committee is weighing Trump and a number of his closest allies for criminal referrals. Thompson said the panel is aiming to release its final report and vote publicly on criminal referrals on December 21. \u201cThere will be some form of public presentation. We haven\u2019t decided exactly what that would be,\u201d Thompson said. The committee subpoenaed Meadows for documents and testimony in September of last year, and he handed over more than 2,000 text messages he sent and received between Election Day 2020 and Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. The text messages, which were obtained by CNN, reveal how top Republican Party officials, right-wing figures and even Trump\u2019s family members discussed with Meadows what Trump should say and do after the election and in the middle of the insurrection. Meadows did not turn over other documents he had, and the House committee voted to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress for it and for his refusal to testify, referring the matter to the Justice Department. The Justice Department has declined to indict Meadows for evading his subpoena, given his high level position in the Trump West Wing and claims of executive privilege. Raskin also suggested Thursday that previous referrals to DOJ for contempt of Congress would not impact how the panel handles these criminal referrals. \u201cWe obviously did contempt of Congress referrals earlier and there\u2019s a whole statutory process for making that happen,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you know we will explain our decisions in detail \u2013 why we are making certain kinds of referrals for certain people and other kinds for others.\u201d Eastman sat for an interview with the panel last year, but invoke his Fifth Amendment rights that protect against self-incrimination. In the midst of a legal fight to obtain Eastman\u2019s emails, a federal judge ruled in March that Eastman, along with Trump, may have been planning a crime as they sought to disrupt the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election. The FBI seized Eastman\u2019s phone in June as part of its criminal investigation according to a court filing from Eastman. David O. Carter, a federal judge in California, ordered Eastman to turn over 101 emails from the period around January 6, 2021, that he has tried to keep secret from the House select committee, which after a lengthy court battle, the panel ultimately received. Carter\u2019s reasoning was a crucial acknowledgment by a federal court that Trump\u2019s interest in overturning the election could be considered criminal. \u201cThe illegality of the plan was obvious,\u201d Carter wrote. In a hearing over the summer, the panel presented revelations that provided new insight into Eastman\u2019s role as a central figure in the effort led by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Eastman was integral to the intense pressure campaign that Trump directed at then-Vice President Mike Pence to compel Pence to help carry out a plan to overturn the election results. In the hearing, the committee walked through how Eastman put forward a legal theory that Pence could unilaterally block certification of the election \u2013 a theory that was roundly rejected by Trump\u2019s White House attorneys and Pence\u2019s team, but was nevertheless embraced by the former President. Clark invoked the Fifth Amendment more than 100 times during his deposition with the committee. Federal investigators have raided Clark\u2019s home as part of their own criminal investigation. The former DOJ official was facing a criminal contempt of Congress referral at the time after he refused to answer the committee\u2019s questions at a prior deposition. The referral was never sent to DOJ because on the day the committee voted on the contempt referral, Clark\u2019s lawyer informed the committee that he planned to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to not answer questions on the grounds it may incriminate him. The panel dedicated much of a June hearing to Clark\u2019s role in Trump\u2019s attempts to weaponize the Justice Department in the final months of his term as part of the plot to overturn the 2020 election and stay in power. The committee in particular zeroed in on the efforts of Rep. Scott Perry, the Pennsylvania Republican, who connected Clark to the White House in December 2020. CNN has previously reported on the role that Perry played, and the committee in court filings released text messages Perry exchanged with Meadows about Clark. \u201cHe wanted Mr. Clark \u2013 Mr. Jeff Clark to take over the Department of Justice,\u201d Cassidy Hutchinson, a former Meadows aide, said about Perry in a clip of her deposition that was played at that hearing. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s onetime personal attorney and a lead architect of his attempt to overturn the 2020 election results, met with the panel in May for more than nine hours. In its initial subpoena, the committee alleges that Giuliani \u201cactively promoted claims of election fraud on behalf of the former President and sought to convince state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results.\u201d The subpoena also stated that Giuliani was in contact with Trump and members of Congress \u201cregarding strategies for delaying or overturning the results of the 2020 election.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

            "article_content": "The former president sometimes called \u201cTeflon Don\u201d is learning that sometimes, the subpoenas do stick. In recent months, former President Donald Trump and his allies have suffered a string of defeats in court as they\u2019ve tried to resist or impede criminal investigations into his conduct. The latest example was Trump\u2019s unsuccessful bid to block testimony from his former White House lawyers before the federal grand jury investigating 2020 election subversion. The attorneys, Pat Cipollone and Pat Philbin, appeared before the DC-based grand jury on Friday. Mar-a-Lago documents: Takeaways from the ruling rebuking Donald Trump and the appointment of a special master The night before, a federal appeals court tossed out the special master review that was holding up parts of the criminal probe into government documents that were taken from his White House to Mar-a-Lago. The Trump-world losing streak reflects the deference that courts tend to give to criminal investigations \u2013 particularly when the probes that have not yet brought charges. Courts have shown far less tolerance for legal delay tactics in cases concerning criminal probes. In its opinion, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals touted the \u201ccase law limiting the federal courts\u2019 involvement in criminal investigations\u201d while deriding \u201cneedless judicial intrusion into the course of criminal investigations \u2013 a sphere of power committed to the executive branch.\u201d The pace of the litigation has been in contrast to how judges allowed Trump to use the legal process to hold up congressional investigations and throw wrenches in the civil lawsuits he faces. \u201cThe criminal investigation does tend to trump most things when it is active and going on,\u201d said Shan Wu, a criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor. \u201cThe purpose of judicial review is to look later to see, was something done wrong here, was something unfair. You don\u2019t put in the judicial review right in the middle of them doing investigation.\u201d Trump and his inner circle are also fending off an Atlanta-area investigation being run out of a special purpose grand jury looking at the election subversion gambits that targeted Georgia in 2020. In that investigation, which is being spearheaded by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, several Trump allies have sought to evade subpoenas demanding that they appear before the grand jury. With very little exception,the attempts by those in the MAGA galaxy to avoid appearing have been unsuccessful. Michael Flynn, who served as national security adviser in Trump\u2019s White House, is the latest witness to strike out in a court battle to block enforcement of a Fulton County subpoena. A Florida judge on Thursday refused to delay Flynn\u2019s testimony while Flynn appeals the order commanding his appearance. Previously, the South Carolina State Supreme Court said that Mark Meadows must appear before the grand jury testimony, and a state court in Colorado this summer compelled the appearance of ex-Trump campaign legal adviser Jenna Ellis. Many of the disputes over the subpoenas are playing out in state courts across the country based on where the witnesses in question now reside. Those courts often made the determination that the witnesses are \u201cnecessary and material\u201d to the investigation, while pointing to the approvals the subpoenas got from the judge in Georgia who is supervising the Fulton County grand jury. \u201cThere\u2019s a very old, going back to England, common law rule that grand juries are entitled every person\u2019s evidence,\u201d said Randall Eliason, a former DOJ prosecutor who now teaches at George Washington University Law School. \u201cThere\u2019s a real strong presumption that because they\u2019re investigating crimes and crimes are\u2026 the most serious things we look at, a grand jury is entitled to hear from everybody,\u201d Eliason said. \u201cYou need a pretty high threshold to resist testifying in a grand jury or to resist turning over information.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham sued in federal court to halt a subpoena in the probe, arguing his testimony was shielded by the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause, which protects certain legislative activity by lawmakers. The litigation delayed his testimony for several months, but the South Carolina Republican ultimately lost \u2013 including at the Supreme Court \u2013 in his efforts to blow off the subpoena altogether. The federal litigation that Rep. Jody Hice brought to quash a subpoena was unsuccessful as well. Lindsey Graham testifies before Georgia grand jury investigating 2020 election aftermath The Trump efforts to block testimony sought by the federal grand jury in the Justice Department\u2019s January 6 probe also have appeared to have fallen short, as they unfolded in highly secretive proceedings that have obscured the legal claims the former president has made. Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court, who oversees the federal grand juries in Washington, recently rejected Trump\u2019s bid to shield Cipollone and Philbin from answering certain questions the former president claimed were covered by privilege. The Justice Department was able to secure their testimony after defeating a previous Trump gambit \u2013 also litigated in secret \u2013 to block advisers to former Vice President Mike Pence from having to answer questions he said were shielded by privilege. While he was in the White House, Trump had a better track record in court battles that stymied investigations. His legal challenges to congressional demands for information stalled those probes for years, with much of the litigation outlasting his presidency. A four-year court battle over the IRS turning over his tax returns to the House concluded only last month with the Supreme Court refusing to block the production. To some extent, Trump was also able to, as president, use those delay tactics to hamper the criminal probes encircling him. Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance had to wait a year to get compliance with a subpoena issued to Trump\u2019s accounting firm for his tax returns after Trump\u2019s challenge to the subpoena was taken up by the Supreme Court. But even then, the courts\u2019 deference to criminal investigations was evident. The Supreme Court treated a similar subpoena issued by House lawmakers with far more skepticism than how it viewed the Vance probe subpoena, with a ruling that said \u201ctwo centuries of experience confirm that a properly tailored criminal subpoena will not normally hamper the performance of the President\u2019s constitutional duties.\u201d Now that he is no longer president, courts are moving even more quickly to resolve the disputes he and his allies are raising \u2013 and the Supreme Court has shown no inclination to get involved. In addition to its refusal to get in the way of Graham\u2019s appearance before the Fulton County grand jury, the Supreme Court has rejected requests by Trump that it interfere with the House\u2019s demands for records from his White House for the January 6 probe. Additionally, the justices refused to reinstate the special master review of the documents marked as classified that were seized in the FBI\u2019s Mar-a-Lago search. Trump brought the matter before the Supreme Court again after an appeals court granted a DOJ request to carve those documents out of the special master process and let the criminal probe into them continue. Now Trump attorneys are weighing whether to turn to the Supreme Court to revive the special master review of the materials the FBI obtained in the search of his Florida home. Not only are claims of executive privilege weaker now that Trump is no longer president, he is facing a higher bar in asking the court to wade into in an investigation being run the executive branch, as opposed to when the dispute was between him and Congress. \u201cYou can\u2019t really argue separation of powers when it comes to a grand jury because that\u2019s also the executive branch,\u201d Eliason said. \u201cSo it\u2019s the executive branch looking at its own stuff.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy counsel Patrick Philbin testified to a federal grand jury for several hours in Washington, DC, on Friday, indicating the Justice Department had compelled the men to answer more questions in the January 6, 2021, criminal investigation despite challenges from Donald Trump\u2019s legal team. The January 6 grand jury activity is the latest indication the investigation \u2013 now led by special counsel Jack Smith \u2013 has pushed in recent months to unearth new details about direct conversations with the former president and advice given to him after the election. Cipollone was first seen entering the grand jury area with his attorney, Michael Purpura, before 9 a.m., and he was there for more than five hours. Purpura has not responded to requests for comment. The grand jury proceedings themselves are confidential. Philbin, whom Purpura also represents, headed into the grand jury area just before the lunch hour on Friday, staying until about 4 p.m. Thomas Windom and Mary Dohrmann, prosecutors in the January 6 investigation who are now to be led by Smith, were also seen walking in with Cipollone. The investigators are looking at efforts to obstruct the transfer of power at the end of Trump\u2019s presidency and have obtained testimony from several administration advisers closest to the former president after the election and as the Capitol was attacked by his supporters. Trump's classic delay and divert legal strategy is running out of road CNN previously reported that Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court, who oversees the federal grand juries in Washington, ordered Cipollone and Philbin to provide additional grand jury testimony this month, following up on their testimony in the fall. The judge has repeatedly rejected Trump\u2019s privilege claims in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigation of efforts to overturn the 2020 election, according to people briefed on the matter. Philbin and Cipollone were both key witnesses to Trump\u2019s actions in the last days of his presidency. Cipollone repeatedly pushed back on efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and according to a Senate Judiciary Committee report, he and Philbin opposed a proposal to replace the attorney general with someone willing to look into false claims of election fraud. Previously, the Justice Department compelled top advisers from Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office to testify to the grand jury. They had sought to protect Pence in January 2021 from Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to overturn the election. Earlier this week, Trump White House official Stephen Miller, who worked with Trump on his speech at the Ellipse, had his own day before the grand jury. On Thursday, another leg of Smith\u2019s special counsel investigation \u2013 into the handling of documents at Mar-a-Lago after the presidency \u2013 was active in the courthouse. At least one Mar-a-Lago prosecutor was working in the secret grand jury proceedings, as three aides to Trump, Dan Scavino, William Russell and Beau Harrison, each appeared, according to sources familiar with them. Their attorney declined to comment. This story has been updated with additional details.",

But the investigation has grown to include the fake electors plot, the presentations made by Trump allies to Georgia lawmakers that promoted bogus voter fraud claims and other Trump-world machinations from that period. The Atlanta-area investigators, in demanding Meadows\u2019 testimony, pointed to his involvement in the Trump-Raffensperger call and to a December 2020 White House meeting about election fraud claims that was touted by Meadows.

            "article_content": "A panel of federal appeals court judges \u2013 all appointed by Republican presidents \u2013 on Tuesday were dubious of former President Donald Trump\u2019s arguments for why the FBI\u2019s search of Mar-a-Lago required a special master to review the materials that were seized. During 40 minutes of oral arguments at the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals, the three-judge panel posed several skeptical questions for the Trump team, suggesting they were not convinced that Trump had shown that an \u201cextraordinary\u201d judicial intervention into the investigation was necessary. Supreme Court clears way for House to get Trump's taxes The move by a Florida-based judge to appoint a third party to help decide what of the roughly 22,000 pages of materials obtained in the search belongs in the hands of investigators had thrown a significant wrench in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigation into whether records from Trump\u2019s White House were mishandled. \u201cOther than the fact that this involves a former president, everything else about this \u2026 is indistinguishable,\u201d Judge William Pryor, the chief judge of the appellate court, told Trump lawyer James Trusty during the arguments. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotta be concerned about the precedent that we would create that would allow any target of offense of a federal criminal investigation to go into district court and to have a district court entertain this kind of petition, exercise equitable jurisdiction (that allows a court to intervene) and interfere with the executive branch\u2019s ongoing investigation,\u201d Pryor said. Trump\u2019s argument that the DOJ\u2019s work could violate his constitutional rights is the foundation of why a trial-level judge put on hold parts of the Justice Department\u2019s investigation and appointed a third-party \u201cspecial master\u201d to sort through thousands of documents that were seized to determine which should be off limits to investigators. On the panel, Pryor, an appointee of George W. Bush, was most direct to say he disagreed with Trump\u2019s reasoning. Two other judges on the panel, Britt Grant and Andrew Basher, both Trump appointees, previously hinted in a ruling related to the case that they believed the trial-level judge had overreached. Trusty argued to the court on Tuesday the search and seizure might have violated the former president\u2019s rights, saying the FBI took golf shirts and Celine Dion pictures from the beach home and resort along with documents marked as classified. What it means that a special counsel is running the Trump investigations The judges pushed back against his characterizations. \u201cThe problem is you know, the search warrant was for classified documents, and boxes, and other items that are intermingled with that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the fault of the government if someone has intermingled classified documents and all kinds of other personal property,\u201d Pryor told Trusty during the arguments. In a separate exchange, Grant cut Trusty off when he called the August search at Mar-a-Lago a \u201craid.\u201d \u201cDo you think a raid is the right term for the execution of a warrant?\u201d Grant asked. Trusty then apologized for using the \u201cloaded term.\u201d Prosecutors are examining whether there was obstruction of justice, criminal handling of government records, and violations of the Espionage Act, which prohibits unauthorized storage of national defense information. The Justice Department has already won a carveout from the 11th Circuit allowing it to continue its investigation into the documents marked as classified. Now, the Justice Department is asking to throw out the entirety of the special master review, which is being led by Raymond Dearie. An appeals court decision that got rid of the special master review of the Mar-a-Lago documents would supercharge the pace of government documents investigation, which is in some ways the simplest of the various probes encircling the former president and 2024 candidate. Special counsel Jack Smith is now overseeing the Mar-a-Lago investigation and the probe into Trump\u2019s efforts after the 2020 election to reverse his electoral defeat. Grant and Brasher were on the panel that granted the DOJ request in September that it be allowed to restart its criminal investigation into the 100 or so documents marked as classified that the FBI obtained in the search. In the September ruling signed by Grant and Brasher concerning the classified documents, the appeals court cast doubt on the legal rationale the lower court judge used to appoint the special master. Because the lower court did not find a \u201ccallous disregard\u201d of Trump\u2019s constitutional rights in the search, the 11th Circuit wrote then, that is \u201creason enough to conclude that the district court abused its discretion in exercising equitable jurisdiction here.\u201d All three of the judges hearing the appeal on Tuesday had pointed questions for Trump\u2019s team about the lack of evidence that his rights had been violated with the search. Trusty argued that through the special master process, Trump\u2019s lawyers may able to show that the search was unlawful. \u201cThe end object of the search is establish it was an unlawful seizure?\u201d Pryor asked, incredulously. Grant, meanwhile, asked Trusty whether he thought it was \u201crare\u201d for a target of a search warrant to think a search warrant was \u201coverreaching.\u201d Pryor\u2019s facial expressions throughout suggested exasperation with the Trump team\u2019s arguments, as he repeatedly shook his head as Trusty attempted to answer his questions. When Trusty said it was \u201cno secret\u201d that the Trump team intended to put forward new arguments and motions to challenge the legality of the search as the special master review unfolded, Pryor interjected, \u201cit\u2019s a secret to this record,\u201d referring to the record that the appellate court was tasked with considering. He also tweaked the Trump\u2019s team\u2019s focus on the personal items of Trump\u2019s \u2013 which they say included golf shirts, birthday cards and even a photo of Celine Dion  \u2013 that were swept up with the search. \u201cThe problem is you know, the search warrant was for classified documents, and boxes, and other items that are intermingled with that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the fault of the government if someone has intermingled classified documents and all kinds of other personal property,\u201d  Pryor told Trusty. The decision by US District Judge Aileen Cannon \u2013 who sits on the federal court in Fort Pierce, Florida \u2013 to appoint a special master attracted criticism from a broad spectrum of legal experts. When the 11th Circuit in September excluded the documents marked as classified from the review, the three-judge panel implied that the entire appointment of a special master was based on a legally flawed premise. However, it will be a new panel \u2013 picked at random \u2013 that hears DOJ\u2019s appeal on Tuesday, creating the possibility that the former president will draw judges who are sympathetic to his claims. The notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump Trump asked for the special master because he said that there was a risk that documents by attorney-client privilege or executive privilege were swept up in the search. In his arguments with the appeals court, however, he is focused on a theory that he had the ability to designate as personal the bulk of the documents from the White House. Therefore, Trump argues, the Justice Department has no right to carry on a criminal probe into how the materials have been handled. \u201cPresident Trump has an obvious interest in his own personal (and even Presidential) records and the District Court acted within its discretion in recognizing a neutral party was needed to facilitate adjudication of the legal status of the documents,\u201d his lawyer said in a brief with the appeals court. The Justice Department told the 11th Circuit that Trump\u2019s new theory was \u201cmeritless,\u201d \u201centirely irrelevant\u201d and an argument that the appeals court should not even consider. Prosecutors argue that there was no justification for requiring the review and that the special master process, by holding up the ability of investigators to use the documents in their probe, is causing undue harm to the public\u2019s interest in the speedy administration of criminal law. Cannon appointed Dearie, a senior judge who sits on Brooklyn\u2019s federal court, to manage the third-party review. Dearie has indicated he\u2019d like to move quickly and has shown little patience for delay tactics from Trump\u2019s team. However, Cannon has intervened at times to tweak his plans, including postponing the end date of the review until at least mid-December. At that point, Dearie will submit a report to Cannon with his recommendations for whom should prevail in the disputes between Trump and the prosecutors over whether certain documents can be used in the investigation, but Cannon will have the final call. Lindsey Graham testifies before Georgia grand jury investigating 2020 election aftermath The Justice Department has already returned to Trump a selection of documents that were either legal in nature or were non-govermment records with sensitive personal information, like medical records. At stake now is the more than 2,800 documents obtained in the search that Trump is fighting to keep out of the investigators\u2019 hands. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "The top House Republican poised to investigate the Biden family said Thursday he\u2019s not planning to subpoena President Joe Biden despite being prepared to issue one to his son, Hunter. \u201cThere\u2019s no plans to subpoena Joe Biden. There are plans to subpoena Hunter Biden,\u201d GOP Rep. Jim Comer told CNN in a sit-down interview. The acknowledgment by Comer, the likely next chairman of the House Oversight Committee, that subpoenaing a sitting president unleashes a host of thorny executive privilege issues underscores the complicated task ahead for Republicans as they claim they will try to connect Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign business dealings to his father. It also comes after the Trump White House stonewalled congressional requests for official and private matters, citing privilege and other claims that the Biden White House is likely to point to in the face of GOP requests. Asked why he plans to subpoena Hunter Biden and not his father, Comer told CNN that trying to compel testimony from a sitting president is \u201ccomplicated,\u201d while saying Republicans are planning a different approach after securing the majority in the House. \u201cThe Democrats sent out subpoenas like junk mail, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to get people to come in,\u201d Comer said. But at the same time, Comer reiterated that his committee\u2019s probe is focused on the sitting president, not his son. \u201cThis needs to be called the Biden investigation and not the Hunter Biden investigation,\u201d he said, echoing comments he made during a press conference earlier Thursday. While in the White House, then-President Donald Trump and his administration raised executive privilege claims and other legal protections they said shielded him as president, fighting to thwart Democratic subpoenas for his tax returns, accounting records, and documents and testimony from witnesses across numerous committees and the House\u2019s first impeachment inquiry. The House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, has continued the congressional pursuit of the Trump administration, successfully obtaining testimony from a host of Trump\u2019s aides but not from the former president himself. The committee issued an eleventh-hour subpoena last month for Trump to testify and turn over documents but he rejected that possibility by filing a lawsuit that will likely render the congressional order moot. Now, as Trump\u2019s GOP allies seek to turn the tables on a Democratic president \u2013 one who defeated their party\u2019s current leading candidate in the 2020 election \u2013 they are faced with the same stark challenges as their colleagues across the aisle during the last administration. The likelihood of Congress being able to enforce a subpoena issued to a sitting president, even if only related to activities from before they assumed that office, is low and there is little precedent in American history, experts say. \u201cAcross Democratic and Republican administrations, the Justice Department has long maintained that a sitting president cannot be compelled to appear before Congress due largely to the imposition on the work of the presidency and comity between the branches,\u201d according to Ryan Goodman, former special counsel for the Department of Defense and co-editor-in-chief at Just Security. \u201cThat position does not turn on whether the actions under consideration occurred before or during a president\u2019s time in office. Executive branch lawyers will likely fight hard to maintain that line, and it could take years to litigate,\u201d he told CNN. The White House said Thursday the GOP investigations are politically motivated and a waste of time. \u201cInstead of working with President Biden to address issues important to the American people, like lower costs, congressional Republicans\u2019 top priority is to go after President Biden with politically motivated attacks chock full of long-debunked conspiracy theories\u201d spokesman for the White House Counsel\u2019s office Ian Sams said in a statement to CNN. \u201cPresident Biden is not going to let these political attacks distract him from focusing on Americans\u2019 priorities, and we hope congressional Republicans will join us in tackling them instead of wasting time and resources on political revenge,\u201d Sams added. Private attorneys representing Biden family members did not respond to requests for comment. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The never-ending legal problems swirling around former President Donald Trump are already taking center stage in his freshly announced 2024 presidential campaign. Trump himself, in his speech declaring his candidacy on Tuesday, ranted about how he was a \u201cvictim\u201d of the \u201cweaponization of the justice system,\u201d as he railed against the search the FBI executed of his Florida home as part of a criminal investigation into the mishandling of documents from his White House. Regardless of whether Trump\u2019s criminal exposure politically undermines his campaign or rallies his supporters, the investigations that could implicate him \u2013 which also include federal and state-level probes into 2020 election subversion gambits \u2013 won\u2019t likely pose any legal barrier to his candidacy. The notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump It is unlikely that even a conviction would disqualify him from the ballot, according to legal experts. \u201cIt might be a practical barrier, it might be a fundraising barrier, but those are political questions, not legal ones,\u201d said Derek Muller, an election law professor at University of Iowa College of Law. On the flip side, Trump\u2019s candidacy for president doesn\u2019t, by itself, give him any additional legal protections in the probes. But it does create a more complicated political and practical environment for investigators to navigate. This question has not been fully settled by the courts, but the general consensus is that neither an indictment nor a conviction would legally prevent Trump from being elected. Not only have convicted felons run for federal office in the past, but at least one ran for president successfully from prison: Eugene Debs, a perennial socialist candidate for the White House in the early 20th century, won more than 900,000 votes in a 1920 presidential campaign he ran while incarcerated on an espionage conviction. The reason why it is widely believed a conviction wouldn\u2019t preclude Trump\u2019s return to the White House is because of a mainstream legal argument that only the Constitution sets the standards candidates must meet to be president. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty widely accepted that the qualifications to serve as president are enumerated in the Constitution,\u201d Muller said. \u201cAnd just being convicted of a felony is not one of them, and states and Congress cannot add to those qualifications.\u201d That is why many legal experts believe that courts would not uphold proposals by states to bar from their ballots presidential candidates who refuse to release their tax returns, as Trump has refused to do. Yet if Trump is charged with one of the statutes federal investigators are examining in the Mar-a-Lago documents probe, it might pose the most serious test yet to the constitutional question. One of the laws implicated in that Justice Department\u2019s Mar-a-Lago investigation, a federal statute that criminalizes the concealment or removal of government records, said that those found guilty \u201cshall forfeit his office and be disqualified from holding any office under the United States.\u201d \u201cIt would present the strongest case for the lawfulness of statutory disqualification that one could make, because of, both, its subject matter \u2013 national security \u2013 and because Congress spoke so explicitly and expressly,\u201d said Paul Rosenzweig, a former official at the US Department of Homeland Security who also worked on the Whitewater investigation into President Bill Clinton. \u201cMy guess is that it would still not stand.\u201d While Trump was in the White House, he put forward arguments in several cases \u2013 sometimes successfully, sometimes not \u2013 that his status as president gave him certain legal protections. But those protections do not now apply to him just because he has announced his bid to reclaim the White House. The residual fights over conduct he engaged in while president will continue, but he doesn\u2019t have any special legal tools to shield things he does or says while he is just a candidate. \u201cThere\u2019s no executive privilege or anything that attaches right now as a candidate,\u201d Muller said. The main advantage being a presidential candidate gives Trump is the promise of delay: that if he can drag out the legal processes long enough that they are not resolved if and when he is reelected, he can then try to use the presidency as a shield then. Trump\u2019s announcement that he was running for president did not create any formal, legal obstacles for criminal investigators examining potential wrongdoing by him or his allies. But Trump\u2019s candidacy could inject other political and practical considerations. As CNN previously reported, the Justice Department was weighing in the weeks leading up to Trump\u2019s announcement whether to appoint a special counsel. DOJ officials have debated whether doing so could insulate the department from allegations that the investigations are politically motivated attacks on President Joe Biden\u2019s 2024 rival. Trump appears for deposition in E. Jean Carroll lawsuit Attorney General Merrick Garland avoided answering a CNN question about the possibility in March, while insisting that the department does \u201cnot shy away from cases that are controversial or sensitive or political.\u201d As of earlier this month, no decision had been made public. No matter where Garland lands on the special counsel question, Trump\u2019s candidacy undoubtedly raises the stakes of the investigation. DOJ will likely be especially cautious and only bring charges if the department is extremely confident it could secure a conviction, former prosecutors said. Trump\u2019s announcement could even speed things up. \u201cI think that the Department of Justice will, with reason, understand that it needs to move like in the first quarter of next year, before the campaign truly gets underway,\u201d Rosenzweig said. \u201cSo it can\u2019t wait \u2026 to bring an indictment until January 2024.\u201d Trump faces legal exposure from the myriad civil lawsuits that have been filed against him, which range from a civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general, to lawsuits seeking damages for his conduct ahead of the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack to the defamation complaint brought by a woman who has accused him of rape. In the cases concerning his conduct while he was in the White House, Trump has sought to raise arguments about legal protections he said his status as president gave him. But he doesn\u2019t get any additional protections by just announcing a presidential campaign. Judge throws out Mary Trump's lawsuit against Donald Trump, saying her claim was barred by prior agreements \u201cThe United States Supreme Court actually approved of civil litigation against President Clinton in the \u201990s, while he was sitting as president. So surely, merely being a candidate for office doesn\u2019t prevent these kinds of cases from going forward,\u201d Muller said. At least in the immediate aftermath of the announcement, perhaps the most tangible effect of Trump declaring his candidacy, where his legal troubles are concerned, is that the Republican National Committee won\u2019t foot the bill for the attorneys representing him in New York investigations scrutinizing his business practices. \u201cWe cannot pay legal bills for any candidate that\u2019s announced,\u201d RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash earlier this month. Trump appears for deposition in E. Jean Carroll lawsuit She said the committee was willing to finance his legal defense in the civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James because the RNC sees that lawsuit as \u201ca politically motivated investigation\u201d that started when he was president. Trump has also used money he\u2019s raised post presidency for his leadership PAC \u2013 a fundraising organ usually used to support other candidates \u2013 to pay for firms representing him in the James case and other matters. \u201cWe cannot do in-kind contributions to any candidate,\u201d McDaniel said at the time. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s the former president who\u2019s being attacked from every which way with lawsuits. And he\u2019s certainly raised more into the RNC than we have spent on these bills.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Congressional Republicans don\u2019t yet have subpoena power to investigate the Biden administration, but some of their investigative targets are already yielding fruit thanks to a lawsuit filed by conservative state attorneys general. A federal judge in Louisiana on Monday ordered an FBI cybersecurity official to be deposed in a lawsuit alleging that the FBI coerced social media companies to block stories about Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop ahead of the 2020 election. The FBI deposition is one of several sought by the state Republican officials in a lawsuit accusing Biden officials of effectively enforcing government censorship by pushing social media companies to, among other things, police speech about the origins of the virus that causes Covid-19, the efficacy of face masks and health care measures intended to curb the spread of the virus, as well as claims about election integrity and the security of voting by mail. Judge Terry Doughty, a Donald Trump appointee overseeing the lawsuit brought by attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, has ordered eight depositions of government officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki, and other officials involved in administration\u2019s public health response. Doughty hasn\u2019t ruled on the merits of the two states\u2019 censorship claims, but has ordered the administration to produce documents identifying government officials and the nature of their communications with social media platforms. Republican lawmakers in Washington have said that when they take over leadership of House committees they plan to conduct aggressive investigations of the Biden administration. That includes probes related to Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden\u2019s son, of Covid origins, and what they say were social media censorship of conservative views on Covid public-health restrictions. Those investigations likely are still months away from inception, and they likely face hurdles including executive privilege claims that would restrict access to internal White House documents. Doughty, however, does not have those restraints. His rulings to date in the alleged censorship lawsuit have opened the way for Republican officials to obtain Biden administration documents and even videotaped depositions of government officials. Republicans in Washington and elsewhere have pursued claims that government officials were behind moves by social media companies to restrict discussion of Hunter Biden-related stories before the 2020 election. They cite the episode as one of several examples of \u201ccensorship\u201d of conservative views by the private companies, which legally have a right to control content on their platforms. The lawsuit by the Missouri and Louisiana attorneys general represents a novel way to pursue those censorship claims by accusing the Biden administration of effectively censoring conservatives by leaning on the private social media companies. It also represents a way for Republicans to effectively practice oversight of the federal administration from outside Washington. They\u2019ve found a ready ear in Doughty. He has been open to Republican arguments that the FBI, under the Trump administration, effectively censored discussion of stories published by the New York Post about a laptop belonging to Hunter Biden. The FBI and US intelligence officials had warned earlier that year that Russia and other countries were seeking to use disinformation to influence the US election. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, in an August interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, appeared to link warnings from the FBI to Facebook\u2019s decision to limit sharing of the New York Post article for several days while the company\u2019s fact checker tried to assess it. In response, dozens of Republican lawmakers wrote Meta seeking communications about the Hunter Biden laptop. Doughty ordered the deposition of Elvis Chan, a San Francisco-based FBI assistant agent in charge for cybersecurity, even after Meta lawyers wrote to the Missouri solicitor general saying: \u201cMr. Chan at no point in time advised Meta to \u2018suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story.\u2019 Nor did any of his colleagues.\u201d The judge, in his ruling, said that \u201ceven if Chan played no role in the Hunter Biden laptop communication issue, he may have knowledge of who did and his deposition is nonetheless warranted.\u201d The FBI didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department and Fauci did not comment. Doughty has previously gained attention with rulings that blocked a Biden administration vaccine mandate and overturning a ban on federal oil and gas leases. Justice officials face tough odds to try to block Doughty\u2019s orders, in part because their appeals would go the conservative-dominated 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which repeatedly has paved the way for Republican initiatives, including the Texas law that effectively banned abortion before the US Supreme Court overturned federal abortion rights under Roe v. Wade. Facing those odds, the Justice Department is seeking block the public release of the video depositions ordered by Doughty. Government lawyers raised concerns about the privacy and safety of government officials, citing threats that Fauci has received threats over his role in nation\u2019s Covid response. In August, a West Virginia man was sentenced to 37 months in federal prison for sending threatening messages to Fauci, including one saying Fauci and his family would be \u201cdragged into the street, beaten to death, and set on fire.\u201d \u201cCivil servants do not volunteer to become public figures when they join the federal ranks; they do not expect to be dragged into the spotlight as a result of litigation,\u201d the Justice Department argued in a court filing last week. \u201cAnd, more specifically, they do not reasonably expect that they will be subjected to video-recorded, publicly disseminated cross-examination about the way that they carried out their job duties.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, has renewed its effort to force former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to testify before Congress about the attack on the US Capitol and to obtain his phone logs, according to attorneys for Meadows. Lawyers for Meadows wrote to a federal court on Wednesday asking for emergency help to hold off the subpoenas. Judge Carl Nichols earlier this week dismissed a lawsuit that Meadows had brought against the select committee last year, where he challenged their subpoenas. One of Meadows\u2019 lawyers, John Moran, explained that after the lawsuit\u2019s dismissal, the select committee reached out to Verizon on Tuesday for Meadow\u2019s personal call and text records. Counsel for the select committee then spoke to Meadows\u2019 team in a conference call on Wednesday, saying they also still want to depose him. \u201cVerizon Wireless further informed me that the Select Committee was seeking their immediate compliance with the subpoena issued\u201d almost a year ago, Moran wrote in a declaration. Moran added that the committee\u2019s \u201ccounsel informed us that they intend to pursue potential avenues for securing Mr. Meadows\u2019s appearance for a deposition, which was the subject of the Select Committee\u2019s September 23, 2021 subpoena.\u201d Meadows\u2019 team is trying to buy time with its new filing, asking Nichols to reconsider his ruling, and for him to put a pause on the subpoenas while the lawyers put together more arguments and the judge considers them. Nichols dismissed the case on jurisdictional grounds without weighing Meadows\u2019 claims, including around executive privilege protections and about the committee\u2019s powers. \u201cHe seeks reconsideration and a temporary stay at this early juncture because, in the immediate aftermath of the Court\u2019s order, the Congressional Defendants have already begun efforts to enforce the subpoenas. If successful, those efforts would moot some or all of Mr. Meadows\u2019s claims before he could exercise his right to seek reconsideration and, if necessary and appropriate, to pursue any appeal,\u201d Meadows\u2019 lawyers wrote in their latest filing. \u201cThe legal issues presented by this case are, as the Court has acknowledged, unique.\u201d The House subpoenaed Meadows for documents and testimony in September of last year, and he handed over more than 2,000 text messages he sent and received between Election Day 2020 and Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. The text messages, which have since been obtained by CNN, reveal how top Republican Party officials, right-wing figures and even Donald Trump\u2019s family members discussed with him what the then-president should say and do after the election and even in the middle of the insurrection. Meadows did not turn over other documents he had, and the House committee voted to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress for it and for his refusal to testify, referring the matter to the Justice Department. He has not been charged with a crime. While the contempt proceeding bubbled up late last year, Meadows went to court, suing the committee. Citing the possibility that information around the ex-president may be privileged, Meadows has told the court he cannot testify and provide phone records.",

            "article_content": "A South Carolina judge on Wednesday ruled that former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows must appear for testimony in the Atlanta-area grand jury 2020 election meddling investigation. \u201cI am going to find that the witness is material and necessary to the investigation and that the state of Georgia is assuring not to cause undue hardship to him,\u201d Judge Edward Miller \u2013 who sits on the Court of Common Pleas in Pickens County, South Carolina \u2013 said at the end of a hearing Wednesday morning. DOJ asks judge to force Trump White House lawyers to testify in Jan. 6 probe The matter was before the South Carolina judge because Meadows now lives in South Carolina and Atlanta-area prosecutors sought an order there compelling his compliance with the subpoena. Meadows plans to appeal the ruling, his attorney James Bannister told CNN. The Fulton County district attorney\u2019s office, which is leading the special grand jury probe in Georgia, said in court filings there are multiple dates in November when they could accommodate Meadows\u2019 testimony. Meadows\u2019 arguments for why he should not have to comply with a subpoena were met with skepticism from the South Carolina judge, who questioned the relevancy of some of the evidence Meadows\u2019 attorney tried to put forward in the hearing, which lasted less than an hour. Miller also jumped in when a question by Bannister posed to a prosecutor involved in the Atlanta probe suggested a partisan motivation of the investigation. \u201cThis is not a political hearing,\u201d Miller told Bannister, calling the line of inquiry \u201cfar afield\u201d from the dispute before the South Carolina court. The judge said that some of the legal arguments Meadows was raising were claims that could be considered by other courts, but were not relevant to the decision before him. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is spearheading the special purpose grand jury investigation into attempts to manipulate Georgia\u2019s 2020 election results. The probe was prompted by the infamous call between Trump and Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, in which Trump requested that Secretary Brad Raffensperger \u201cfind\u201d the votes that would secure his victory. But the investigation has grown to include the fake electors plot, the presentations made by Trump allies to Georgia lawmakers that promoted bogus voter fraud claims and other Trump-world machinations from that period. The Atlanta-area investigators, in demanding Meadows\u2019 testimony, are pointing to his involvement in the Trump-Raffensperger call and to a December 2020 White House meeting about election fraud claims that was touted by Meadows. Their filings also reference his visit to a site where an audit of Georgia\u2019s election was underway and emails Meadows sent to Justice Department officials about unsubstantiated fraud allegations. Meadows, in court filings, argued that the South Carolina law that Fulton County district attorney is using to force his appearance does not apply to the subpoena in question. Meadow\u2019s attorney also stressed at the hearing executive privilege concerns, noting his ongoing federal court lawsuit challenging a House January 6 select committee subpoena. Clarence Thomas freezes order for Lindsey Graham to testify before Georgia grand jury investigating 2020 election Will Wooten \u2013 a deputy district attorney in Willis\u2019 office who testified as a witness at the hearing \u2013 noted that Meadows traveled to the Georgia audit site apparently by himself. \u201cThere\u2019s multiple places where there is no executive privilege issue,\u201d Wooten said. Other former Trump allies, including his then-attorney Jenna Ellis, have brought similar challenges to the Fulton County probe\u2019s subpoenas \u2013 but most have been unsuccessful so far. However, one Texas attorney who participated in the presentations to Georgia lawmakers was able to defeat Willis\u2019 office in such a subpoena dispute. A bid by Sen. Lindsey Graham to halt a subpoena in the investigation for his testimony is currently before the US Supreme Court. This story has been updated with additional details.

            "article_content": "The Justice Department is asking a federal judge to force the top two lawyers from Donald Trump\u2019s White House counsel\u2019s office to testify about their conversations with the former President, as it tries to break through the privilege firewall Trump has used to avoid scrutiny of his actions on January 6, 2021, according to three people familiar with the investigation. The move to compel additional testimony from former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin just last week is part of a set of secret court proceedings. Trump has been fighting to keep former advisers from testifying before a criminal grand jury about certain conversations, citing executive and attorney-client privileges to keep information confidential or slow down criminal investigators. But the Justice Department successfully secured answers from top vice presidential advisers Greg Jacob and Marc Short over the past three weeks in significant court victories that could make it more likely the criminal investigation reaches further into Trump\u2019s inner circle. Top Trump aide Hope Hicks meets with January 6 committee Jacob\u2019s testimony on October 6, which has not been previously reported, is the first identifiable time when the confidentiality Trump had tried to maintain around the West Wing after the 2020 election has been pierced in the criminal probe following a court battle. A week after Jacob spoke to the grand jury again, Short had his own grand jury appearance date, CNN reported. All four men previously declined to answer some questions about advice and interactions with Trump when they testified in recent months in the secret criminal probe. Trump lost the court battles related to Jacob and Short before the chief judge of the trial-level US District Court in Washington, DC, last month. Attorneys for the men whom the DOJ is seeking to compel have declined to comment for this story or haven\u2019t responded to requests. Cipollone and Philbin didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the Justice Department also declined to comment. All four men have been willing to be as cooperative as the law demands, leaving Trump\u2019s team to handle the fight over certain details in the investigation, the sources say. The litigation around Cipollone and Philbin\u2019s testimony may be important for investigators in the long run, given how close the pair was to the Trump leading up to and during the Capitol riot. Prosecutors are likely to aim for the grand jury to hear about their direct conversations with the then-President. The disputes \u2013 conducted under seal in court because they involve grand jury activity \u2013 may also spawn several more court fights that will be crucial for prosecutors as they work to bring criminal charges related to Trump\u2019s post-election efforts. Clarence Thomas freezes order for Lindsey Graham to testify before Georgia grand jury investigating 2020 election Witnesses the federal grand jury has subpoenaed, such as former White House officials Mark Meadows, Eric Herschmann, Dan Scavino, Stephen Miller and campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn, also could decline to describe their conversations with Trump or advice being given to him after the election, several sources familiar with the investigation say. Trump and his allies have used claims of confidentiality \u2013 both executive privilege and attorney-client privilege - with mixed results in multiple legal quagmires that surround the former President. Those include the January 6 federal criminal investigation, the Mar-a-Lago documents federal criminal investigation, Georgia\u2019s Fulton County investigation of election meddling, and the House select committee probe of January 6 as well. Some of the privilege arguments Trump has raised have never been settled in federal court, and some of the fights could lead to the Supreme Court. Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich slammed the \u201cweaponized\u201d Justice Department in a statement and referred to the probes surrounding the former President as \u201cwitch hunts.\u201d According to the sources, the Justice Department won a trial-level judge\u2019s order at the end of September that said Jacob and Short must testify in response to certain questions over which Trump\u2019s team had tried to claim presidential and attorney-client confidentiality. The sealed court case, stemming from the grand jury\u2019s work, had been before the chief judge of the DC District Court, Beryl Howell. Howell refused to put on hold Jacob and Short\u2019s testimony while Trump\u2019s team appealed, a source said. The Trump team, meanwhile, took several days to respond to their loss before Howell in court. The Justice Department set a quick-turnaround subpoena date for Jacob, leaving him to head into the grand jury under subpoena on October 6, according to several sources. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals is still considering legal arguments from Trump\u2019s defense lawyers and the Justice Department over his ability to make executive and attorney-client privilege claims. How that is resolved \u2013 either by the appeals court or even the Supreme Court, if Trump pursues it that far \u2013 could have significant consequences for the January 6 criminal investigation, and for multiple witnesses who may be refusing to share some of what they know because of Trump\u2019s privilege claims. Among a large group of former top Trump officials, Jacob has been one of the most searing voices condemning the then-President\u2019s actions after the election, especially regarding the pressure he and his election attorney, John Eastman, tried to place on then-Vice President Mike Pence to block the congressional certification of the presidential vote. Jacob has been a harsh critic of Eastman, who is also of interest to prosecutors,  dating back to when Eastman tried to convince Pence\u2019s office the vice president alone could override the vote. He told Eastman at the time  the right-wing attorney was a \u201cserpent in the ear\u201d of the President, and wrote while Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, \u201cthanks to your bulls**t, we are now under siege.\u201d Jacob added to a parade of star witnesses at public House select committee hearings this summer, speaking candidly about his disgust with what he witnessed inside the White House complex from his high-ranking position administration. \u201cThere is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person would choose the American President, and then unbroken historical practice for 230 years, that the vice president did not have such an authority,\u201d Jacob testified in July. Exclusive: Trump adviser Kash Patel has appeared before grand jury in Mar-a-Lago document probe But what Jacob and Short knew of Trump\u2019s conversations, they wouldn\u2019t disclose to the House nor to the grand jury until this month. In a taped House select committee deposition, Cipollone answered many questions about what happened inside the West Wing on January 6 but declined to describe communications between him and Trump. Cipollone\u2019s and Philbin\u2019s roles as White House lawyers raise complicated legal questions about whether Trump can claim confidentiality over the legal advice they gave him, as well as whether a former president can assert executive privilege to hold off criminal investigators. President Joe Biden has repeatedly declined to assert executive privilege around January 6 information, essentially leaving the fight for Trump to wage opposite the Justice Department. While the courts will look at each situation individually, history isn\u2019t on Trump\u2019s side. Federal prosecutors investigating former Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon were able to overcome attorney-client privilege assertions for White House counsel as well as executive privilege assertions so the grand jury could hear closely guarded information.

            "article_content": "Prosecutors in Georgia have secured grand jury testimony from two prominent witnesses \u2013 former US Sen. Kelly Loeffler and former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone \u2013 in their investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in that state, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. Their grand jury appearances in recent months, which have not been previously reported, highlight the wide-ranging investigation underway as Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis probes efforts by former President Donald Trump and his allies to try to keep him in power. Cipollone was the top White House lawyer at the end of the Trump administration and attended some of the meetings where Trump and his allies discussed ways to subvert the election results. He was among the former President\u2019s advisers who pushed back along with the Justice Department, which found no evidence to support the claims of widespread fraud. Cipollone has provided testimony to the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, as well as to a federal grand jury in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigation, where he invoked Trump\u2019s privilege claims to decline to answer some questions. He declined to comment on questions about the grand jury. The revelation that Loeffler testified before the grand jury comes as hundreds of Loeffler\u2019s text messages have surfaced, revealing new details about the Georgia Republican\u2019s correspondence about efforts to challenge the election in the months leading up to and immediately following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Loeffler lost her Senate seat last year in a runoff race to Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Democrat. Loeffler now leads a conservative voter mobilization organization in Georgia. Loeffler was a staunch Trump ally while serving in Congress as Georgia\u2019s junior senator and prior to the violence on January 6, she planned to vote against certifying her state\u2019s electoral results in support of the former President\u2019s broader effort to upend Joe Biden\u2019s legitimate victory. After the US Capitol attack, Loeffler backed off her objection, saying on the Senate floor: \u201cWhen I arrived in Washington this morning, I fully intended to object to the certification of the electoral votes. However, the events that have transpired today have forced me to reconsider, and I cannot now in good conscience object to the certification of these electors.\u201d In the same speech, Loeffler condemned the violence at the Capitol, calling it \u201cabhorrent.\u201d It\u2019s unclear what Fulton County prosecutors hoped to glean from Loeffler, as the grand jury proceedings in their wide-ranging investigation are secret. Loeffler spokeswoman Caitlin O\u2019Dea declined to comment on Loeffler\u2019s grand jury appearance. Text messages, first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and also obtained by CNN, reveal that Loeffler appeared to be in direct communication with members of the Trump family in the weeks leading up to January 6, including the former President\u2019s daughter and senior adviser Ivanka. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported it was able to confirm the veracity of the exchanges with four people who were participants in some of the conversations. Loeffler also received several messages from then Congresswoman-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene during this time, including one asking her to talk \u201cabout a plan we are developing on how to vote on the electoral college votes on Jan 6th,\u201d a month before that date, according to the messages obtained by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and CNN. On December 20, Greene also invited Loeffler to a White House meeting she organized with Trump and other members of Congress who were going to \u201cchallenge the Electoral College votes for Biden in several key swing states on January 6,\u201d according to the messages. A spokesperson for Greene did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The log contains more than 400 text messages and appears to only contain election-related correspondence. The 59-page document was provided to media organizations by an anonymous sender who declined to offer additional details about the source of the communications, which span from early November 2020 to early February 2021. The document was sent as a report from Cellebrite, a service used by investigators to collect, review and analyze cellphone data, according to the company\u2019s website. O\u2019Dea slammed the text messages as \u201cunverified content\u201d and called their release \u201ca desperate attempt to distract voters twenty days from the election. As a top Republican donor who\u2019s invested millions to rebuild Georgia\u2019s conservative infrastructure over the last year and a half, the attacks against Kelly are no surprise.\u201d Jeff DiSantis, deputy district attorney, said Thursday, \u201cThe Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s Office has not released any documents related to Senator Kelly Loeffler.\u201d He declined to comment on the grand jury appearances.",

            "article_content": "Two former Trump administration officials were seen Thursday at the Washington, DC, federal courthouse where  the grand jury investigating the January 6 US Capitol attack meets. Marc Short, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, was compelled to testify to the January 6 grand jury on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter. It was his second time testifying. Short had originally declined to answer some questions because of former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege. He was seen walking out of the courthouse. Asked why he was there, Short said: \u201cI got nothing to offer you.\u201d Jan. 6 committee to hold public hearing Short previously testified this summer in front of the grand jury investigating the attack on the Capitol. His appearance at the court Thursday also comes as the Justice Department and attorneys for Trump are engaged in a secret court fight to stop a federal grand jury from getting information from former Trump administration officials. Trump adviser and former national security aide Kash Patel was also seen walking into an area where the grand jury meets. Patel did not answer questions from reporters about why he was at the court. A spokeswoman for Patel told CNN she was not aware Patel was at the courthouse. A senior Pence ally, Short thwarted Trump\u2019s attempts to stay in power after losing the 2020 election. He made it clear that Pence wouldn\u2019t go along with Trump\u2019s ham-handed and possible illegal scheme to overturn the results during the Electoral College certification on January 6. Short has also cooperated with the House select committee investigating January 6. Unlike Short, Patel was a Trump loyalist, who has peddled false claims and conspiracies about the \u201cdeep state\u201d and the 2020 election. Patel was a senior national security official at the Trump White House, before moving over to the Pentagon during the final months of Trump\u2019s tenure. There were even plans during the transition to fire the CIA director and install Patel in her place, so he could declassify documents that Trump believed proved his \u201cdeep state\u201d conspiracies.

            "article_content": "Among the items seized by the FBI at Mar-a-Lago were clemency requests, health care documents, IRS forms and paperwork that appears to be related to the 2020 election, according to a Justice Department list made public this week. The collection also included apparent communications about former President Donald Trump\u2019s business connections, including what\u2019s described as a confidential settlement agreement between PGA and Trump Golf, as well as an email accepting Trump\u2019s resignation from SAG, or the Screen Actors Guild. Full details of the documents aren\u2019t available, but taken together, the newly public list offers a glimpse into a handful of the thousands of documents Trump was keeping at his Florida residence and resort after his presidency, and which the FBI removed from the beach club. On Tuesday night, Bloomberg News made the list public by posting the court record of it online. The news outlet reported that the list was briefly \u2013 and apparently inadvertently \u2013 posted to the public court docket. The list was made by a \u201cPrivilege Review Team\u201d used by the Justice Department to filter out materials seized at Mar-a-Lago. Federal appeals court to expedite case weighing legality of Mar-a-Lago special master In all, the list identified 64 sets of materials, or about 520 pages, that the Justice Department\u2019s privilege reviewers thought may need to be filtered out from the investigation and kept private. In the items listed that appear to pertain to the 2020 election, the team filtered out emails from a Republican lawyer to the White House regarding a lawsuit in Georgia, as well as a sticky note that said \u201cJoe Digernova Appoint Special Councel [sic],\u201d a possible reference to Joe diGenova, a lawyer assisting Trump in efforts to sow doubt in the 2020 election result. Former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, businessman Ted Suhl and several people only identified by initials are named in the document list regarding the then-President\u2019s consideration of clemency grants. Several other records on the list pertained to legal work for Trump, lawsuits and other legal disputes. The privilege review team was the initial bulwark the DOJ put in place so as not to breach attorney-client or presidential privileges, but a federal judge has now appointed a third-party \u201cspecial master\u201d to go through the documents again alongside the DOJ and Trump\u2019s team. The team\u2019s list made public by Bloomberg News was submitted to a federal court, marked sealed, and stamped for authenticity. A shorter portion of the record is still publicly available but does not include the inventory list. Previously, the DOJ had written in its public filings that the privilege review team pulled out from investigators\u2019 access: an email between a baseball coach from the Air Force Academy and the White House; a box of documents that included one paper containing a law firm\u2019s letterhead \u201ccomingled with newspapers\u201d; what appeared to be pages of \u201cThe President\u2019s Calls\u201d; and a message from a \u201cRudy,\u201d likely the attorney Rudy Giuliani, that didn\u2019t appear to be legal advice. A spokesman for the Justice Department, which submitted the entire document to the court on August 30, didn\u2019t immediately have a comment. Also this week in the Mar-a-Lago document review process, the Justice Department on Wednesday announced in a court filing it and Trump\u2019s team had contracted with third-party vendors to host the thousands of pages of documents seized, so the special master and the Trump team could review them electronically. This was an expected part of the special master review process, where Trump\u2019s team can try to argue to a third-party appointee that some records should not be able to be used by the Justice Department investigators because they are confidential. The special master\u2019s work continues, even while the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals considers a challenge from the DOJ to the special master on the whole.",

            "article_content": "If at first you don\u2019t succeed, try, try again. The right wing Supreme Court majority built by ex-President Donald Trump has ruled just as conservatives had hoped on politically charged cases on abortion, climate and religion. Yet it has been far less tolerant of his efforts to block congressional investigators\u2019 access to presidential records as well as prosecutors\u2019 access to tax records and of his spurious election fraud claims. So Trump\u2019s latest appeal to the nine justices in the Mar-a-Lago documents furor \u2013 another apparent delaying tactic \u2013 may be a long shot and could even backfire. Trump on Tuesday filed an emergency application to the court to step into his dispute with the Justice Department over documents marked classified that he hoarded at the resort in Florida. Trump goes to Supreme Court over Mar-a-Lago search and seizure of documents Unlike his frequently more florid and fantastical legal gambits, this one is narrow and legally nuanced \u2013 far smaller than a possible broader attempt to test an ex-president\u2019s scope to claim executive privilege or some kind of claim that the search on his home in August was illegal. Instead, Trump wants the court to ensure that more than 100 documents designated as classified are included in a review by a third party official known as a \u201cspecial master.\u201d The ex-President has every legal right to take such a step. But it\u2019s also the case that Trump\u2019s team has repeatedly sought to slow down the Justice Department\u2019s classified documents probe in the courts, which reflects his characteristic desire to postpone accountability. In this case, any delays could push it closer to a possible Trump 2024 presidential campaign and fuel his claims of political persecution. But, just as in other recent filings by Trump to the Supreme Court, the tactic may not work, according to legal experts. \u201cThe Supreme Court has not looked very kindly on former President Trump in cases that he\u2019s brought with respect to documents and his personal property both when Congress was the one seeking information from him and other government entities were the ones seeking information from him,\u201d said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst and former Justice Department official. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty consistently lost those cases. And it\u2019s not hard to see how either the court just doesn\u2019t take this up or rules against him if they do.\u201d Trump has built a personal record of frustration before the Supreme Court. In January, the court declined to block a handover from the National Archives of 700 documents that the House select committee probing the US Capitol insurrection said that it needed for its investigation. The Supreme Court several times rejected challenges to the 2020 election. The court has also ruled that the then-President was not immune from a New York subpoena in a criminal investigation seeking his tax records. Trump has long appeared to believe that judges he appointed owe him loyalty. He nominated three of the Supreme Court\u2019s nine justices \u2013 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. And he has typically reacted badly to his defeats before the top bench. In December 2020, for instance, he tweeted that the court had let him down and displayed neither wisdom nor courage in dismissing a challenge to the election. But sometimes even humiliating court defeats can bring Trump other benefits. While it is too early to predict how the court will handle this case, just bringing it to them works for Trump in a number of political ways. It keeps him in the news and fuels a sense among his supporters that he is being treated unfairly. As in this case, Trump often substitutes a political or public relations strategy for a strong legal one. And it would be no surprise to see Trump fundraising off of his emergency request. His latest move is also consistent with his habit of using every possible avenue in the legal system to slow a case or fog it up. Taking that a step further, CNN legal analyst Steve Vladeck suggested that the application to the court partly came across as an attempt by his team to placate a highly litigious client. \u201cThis is what good lawyers who are stuck do to appease bad clients: The jurisdictional argument is narrow, technical, and non-frivolous. It\u2019s a way of filing *something* in the Supreme Court without going all the way to crazytown and/or acting unethically,\u201d Vladeck, a University of Texas law professor, wrote on Twitter. Specifically, Trump\u2019s emergency request does not ask the Supreme Court to restore a hold that district court Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he nominated, had imposed on the Justice Department accessing those documents marked as classified as it investigates their retention at Mar-a-Lago. He instead wants the classified documents at issue included in a review by the special master after the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the DOJ and exempted them from the review process. The department had argued that including those documents in the special master review would harm national security. But Trump\u2019s team pushed back, saying in Tuesday\u2019s filing that this position \u201ccannot be reconciled\u201d with the DOJ saying it may want to show those same documents to a grand jury or to witnesses during interviews. And the application opened with a highly political argument \u2013 claiming that the \u201cunprecedented circumstances\u201d of the case represented an \u201cinvestigation of the Forty-Fifth President of the United States by the administration of his political rival and successor\u201d \u2013 that took large liberties with the facts of the Mar-a-Lago case. That reasoning struck former White House counsel John Dean as \u201cthin.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t see much of an emergency,\u201d Dean, who was at the center of the Watergate scandal that brought down President Richard Nixon, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday. \u201cThe arguments are highly technical and not the sort of thing the Supreme Court, I would think, would want to get into given their current standing in public opinion.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Tuesday to intervene in the dispute over materials marked as classified that the FBI seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate this summer. His emergency request with the Supreme Court is the latest example of the former President seeking to involve the justices in investigations that entangle him \u2013 at a time when the high court\u2019s legitimacy in politically explosive cases is under intense scrutiny. Trump is specifically asking the court to ensure that the more than 100 documents marked as classified are part of the special master\u2019s review. The request, if granted, could bolster the former President\u2019s attempt to challenge the search in court, as he has argued that he may have had a right, as a former president, to possess certain government documents, including documents potentially containing the country\u2019s most sensitive secrets. Trump, though, is not asking the Supreme Court to block the Justice Department from using the documents in its criminal probe into how materials from his White House were mishandled. READ: Trump asks Supreme Court to intervene in dispute over Mar-a-Lago search and seizure of documents Justice Clarence Thomas \u2013 the recipient of Trump\u2019s application because he oversees litigation coming from the circuit court that is handling the special master order appeal \u2013 gave the Justice Department a deadline of 5 p.m. Tuesday, October 11, to respond. It remains to be seen whether allowing the special master \u2013 a third-party attorney tasked with reviewing evidence and filtering out privileged documents \u2013 to also access classified documents poses a real threat to the criminal investigation. Nor is it clear how sympathetic the high court will be to Trump\u2019s claims, which rest largely on technical arguments about whether an appeals court had the authority to carve out the 100 documents from the review. Late last year, Trump asked the justices to block the release of documents from his White House to congressional January 6, 2021, investigators. The high court rejected the request. Trump\u2019s emergency application to the Supreme Court comes after the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Justice Department and said that the department\u2019s criminal investigation into the documents marked as classified could continue. The probe\u2019s use of the records had been put on hold by a district judge in Florida, who granted a Trump request for a third-party review of the materials obtained in the Mar-a-Lago search. That appeals court is now considering whether to wipe away the rest of the special master order. Trump is not asking the high court to restore the hold that Judge Aileen Cannon \u2013 a US district judge he nominated in 2020 \u2013 put on the Justice Department probe accessing the documents marked classified. But Trump wants those documents put back within the scope of the materials special master is reviewing. In the new filing, Trump\u2019s attorneys said that \u201cany limit on the comprehensive and transparent review of materials seized in the extraordinary raid of a President\u2019s home erodes public confidence in our system of justice.\u201d They also pushed back on the Justice Department\u2019s claims that including the documents in the special master review would pose national security risks. \u201cThe Government argued on appeal, without explanation, that showing the purportedly classified documents to Judge Dearie would harm national security,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys said, referring to senior Judge Raymond Dearie, who has been appointed special master in the dispute. The Trump team said that position \u201ccannot be reconciled\u201d with the DOJ saying it may want to show those same documents to a grand jury or to witnesses during interviews. In filings before the lower court, the Justice Department had also cautioned that having Dearie\u2019s review cover those documents would potentially allow members of Trump\u2019s legal team to access them, including lawyers whom the department has signaled it views as possible witnesses in its investigation. Cannon, the Justice Department previously told the 11th Circuit, had \u201cordered disclosure of highly sensitive material to a special master and to Plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2014potentially including witnesses to relevant events\u2014in the midst of an investigation, where no charges have been brought.\u201d The purpose of getting a special master to review those documents is not entirely fleshed out by Trump\u2019s new filing with the Supreme Court. Trump nodded to Cannon\u2019s assertion that he, as former president, would suffer \u201creputational harm of a decidedly different order of magnitude\u201d if he was indicted based on evidence that had been unlawfully seized. That rationale was squarely rejected by the 11th Circuit, when it carved out the documents from the special master review. Elsewhere in the new application, Trump indicated his desire to include the documents marked as classified in the churn of challenges his lawyers will get to hash out before Dearie as part of the special master process. He re-upped arguments \u2013 viewed with extreme skepticism by a broad range of legal experts \u2013 that the Presidential Records Act may shield him from criminal charges brought for how he handled the materials. Trump also hinted at the idea that he may have declassified the records in question. As he has in earlier stages of the litigation, however, Trump stopped short of making the assertion outright. On Tuesday, Trump told the Supreme Court that Cannon had the authority to refer \u201cthese matters to a special master to determine whether documents bearing classification markings are in fact classified, and regardless of classification, whether those records are personal records or Presidential records, such that their disposition may be managed properly under the PRA.\u201d \u201cThe Government\u2019s position presumes certain documents are in fact classified, affording President Trump no opportunity to contend otherwise. This presumption is at the core of the dispute,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s application is landing at the Supreme Court\u2019s door step as it embarks on a new term where the justices will consider several high-profile cases. The Supreme Court, with its current conservative majority, is already viewed by the American public as partisan following a string of controversial rulings this year, including overturning Roe v. Wade, and will likely make the Mar-a-Lago search even more of an issue in the upcoming congressional midterm elections. Trump appointed three of the current justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. In addition, the justice who receives Supreme Court emergency requests out of Florida is conservative Thomas, although he is almost guaranteed to refer the petition to the full court to consider. Thomas\u2019 wife, conservative activist Ginni Thomas, promoted efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and has testified before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said the appeal is intended to delay the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into the former President, if possible. \u201cThis is part of the delay strategy,\u201d Honig said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper,\u201d noting Trump lost at the appeals court. \u201cSo either he accepts that loss and those documents don\u2019t go to the special master and they go right over to DOJ, or his only remaining recourse is to try to get the Supreme Court to take it, and that\u2019s the course he\u2019s taking now.\u201d Honig said it\u2019s a \u201cclose call\u201d if the court will take up the case. \u201cThe Supreme Court typically likes to stay out of messy, political disputes,\u201d Honig said. \u201cOn the other hand, when it comes to sort of unique, novel issues of constitutional law, of separation of power, of issues like executive privilege and classification of documents, that\u2019s sort of why the Supreme Court exists \u2013 to adjudicate those high level disputes between branches that involve sort of core constitutional principles.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details Tuesday.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. While a lot of us have been diverted by weather events (Ian) and world events (Russia) there were multiple developments on multiple fronts where it concerns former President Donald Trump this week. Trump rode out the storm in Mar-a-Lago, which enabled him to delay testimony in a class action fraud lawsuit. The January 6 committee postponed its planned public hearing due to the storm, but it did interview Ginni Thomas, conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. A judge Trump appointed in Florida shielded him from the special master he requested and she approved, which means he does not have to justify in court some of his wild claims about the FBI. I talked to Katelyn Polantz, CNN\u2019s senior crime and justice reporter, who keeps track of all of this, to get read in on the developments. We conducted this conversation by direct message. WHAT MATTERS: What\u2019s the thing this week that most caught your attention and why? POLANTZ: What all of these developments have in common is how timing really is everything. This week, there was a clear need to shift from the daily grind of investigations and legal battles to focus on the devastation of the hurricane in Florida. But things are really getting down to the wire on some political fronts. In the deposition situation, that lawsuit had a deadline of Friday to get Trump under oath, months after he had agreed to do the deposition. It was scheduled for the very last day it was possible, but the hurricane and his insistence on staying in Florida really threw a wrench in that. The new deadline for his deposition now is end of October, which further delays the work being done in that case, which is a class action against his promotions of scam businesses. The House too is not being helped by delay. The January 6 committee has an expiration date tied to the end of this Congress in January. As the congressional election draws near, there\u2019s not much more time for public hearings before people vote. That said, the committee is obviously continuing its work and still promises to release a final report before the end of the year. It\u2019s not clear if they will be able to muster the same political impact as their series of hearings over the summer. As for the Mar-a-Lago investigation \u2013 perhaps the most high-stakes legal situation Trump faces \u2013 Judge Aileen Cannon has given the Trump team an extra gift, in that prosecutors won\u2019t be getting clarity on the issues Trump has with what was seized, or the ability to use the non-classified documents in their investigation until after the November election. The name of the game right now on every front for Trump is delay, delay, delay. Though there\u2019s still a question of whether he can hold off all the investigations bearing down around him in a way that runs out the clock. WHAT MATTERS: You wrote an interesting story last week, along with Evan Perez and Zachary Cohen, about Trump\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d court fight to block information from a federal grand jury. I feel like that is another theme of these inquiries. There is the publicly known information, the reported details, and then the secret things lurking below the water. What else can we assume we don\u2019t know about? POLANTZ: There are always parts of investigations, or even entire investigative avenues, we don\u2019t know about. That\u2019s just the nature of how investigations, especially those being done by the Justice Department, work. We can\u2019t assume much more than what we\u2019ve reported, because this fight, like many others, didn\u2019t bubble out of nowhere. It is another step in a painstaking effort from the federal grand jury in DC to gather information from top advisers to Trump in the White House and then-Vice President Mike Pence. We know it regards Trump\u2019s assertions of privilege, and it could impact a very important set of witnesses, and whether they and others can be compelled to share interactions that have so far been kept secret from all investigations. We also know that, because of how Trump tends to push the courts into uncharted legal territory, we may be in for tracking rounds of appeals \u2013 even if the past precedent indicates that even sitting presidents lose these types of battles in criminal probes. But how the outcomes will settle, and when, remains a major question. WHAT MATTERS: The DOJ is not the only government entity with an investigation that could touch Trump. What\u2019s going on with the Fulton County DA\u2019s investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election in that state? POLANTZ: That grand jury is still at work! They\u2019re bringing in witnesses like Boris Epshteyn this week. Like most grand jury investigations, their work could result in charges against one or many people \u2013 several allies of Trump have received target letters. But where the investigation is exactly, and how it is functioning at the local level is a question that may be answered better by others than me. POLANTZ: There is an intriguing situation with all these simultaneous investigation I want to mention \u2013 WHAT MATTERS: Go on\u2026 POLANTZ: At the end of the day, will the Big Kahuna of January 6 investigations, the one being done by the Justice Department out of Washington, get answers no other investigators have been able to get? With so many investigations simultaneously, this is a very complex game. Take for instance, Jeffrey Clark, the ex-DOJ official whose phone was seized by federal investigators as part of their investigation into conspiracy and obstructive acts. He has not been charged with any crime. He is facing an attorney discipline case in DC that resulted from months of investigation and was pursued by the House Select Committee. In both of those situations, he took the Fifth and didn\u2019t answer questions. Will the DOJ, which has tools to immunize witnesses and force them to answer questions, be able to get someone like him to talk? Will they even want to try to get him to talk? Lots of people close to Trump are taking the Fifth, based on what we know of their non-answers to the House Select Committee. WHAT MATTERS: That\u2019s an interesting side drama \u2013 Trump\u2019s legal team. There was a report this week about one of his newer lawyers, Chris Kise, being sidelined. What, if anything, do we know about the size of his legal team, how they are being paid, and how they are dividing up these many, many, many different cases? POLANTZ: Zach, you are asking the most complex questions today! From what we know, there are many attorneys working with Trump, and no central person coordinating all his efforts and keeping tabs on all investigative subjects who are close to and aligned with him. Payments to various lawyers have popped up consistently on Trump\u2019s political committee expenditure reports. The lawyer who was sidelined \u2013 who was brought in to take charge in Florida with the Mar-a-Lago situation and was on track to have a $3 million retainer fee \u2013 wasn\u2019t even on the Trump team\u2019s latest filing in the public court record. There are three lawyers still listed. One of whom, Evan Corcoran, is on a separate team of three lawyers who went to court on the January 6 privilege fight, alongside yet another two attorneys. Others that we know of are in the background, including Ephsteyn. I\u2019m not even getting to the various legal teams Trump uses to respond to his myriad ongoing civil suits. That would be a tome. Of course, it\u2019s not unusual for a person with a lot of legal entanglements to need a lot of lawyers. That said, lawyers don\u2019t come cheap! On top of all these attorneys, Trump is on the hook for special master costs in the Mar-a-Lago document review. The special master selected, a working judge, isn\u2019t taking payment, but a retired judge he\u2019s brought on to help him will be billing $500 an hour. And in the legal world, that\u2019s a bargain. WHAT MATTERS: I think that\u2019s a good place to leave it today. Keep up the good work! POLANTZ: You as well!",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump got another boost in his bid to challenge the FBI search of his Florida home, with US District Judge Aileen Cannon reshaping the plan put forward by the special master she appointed to review the materials seized at Mar-a-Lago last month. Cannon nixed several aspects of the plan proposed by senior Judge Raymond Dearie, who was put forward by Trump for the third-party review, that would have required the former President to make uncomfortable assertions in court, including whether he actually believes the FBI planted evidence at Mar-a-Lago, as he has suggested in public statements. Dearie has shown himself to be far less sympathetic to Trump\u2019s claims than Cannon, who Trump had nominated in 2020 and was confirmed by the Senate after the November 2020 election. On Thursday, Cannon also pushed back the timeline for the review by at least a half-month, while making clear that additional litigation that Trump will have the chance to bring, after the special master process is finished, challenging the search will remain on her docket. It\u2019s unclear what the delay and the other opportunities Trump will have to hamstring the review will mean for the larger Justice Department investigation, which is looking at whether crimes were committed in how documents from the Trump White House were handled. With the intervention of the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this month, the department was allowed to resume the criminal probe\u2019s use of the documents marked as classified, which may well be the heart of the investigation. Prosecutors have indicated in court filings that understanding how those sensitive government documents were intermixed with other materials at Mar-a-Lago is something they\u2019re closely reviewing. Cannon on Thursday rejected part of the special master\u2019s plan that would have forced the former President\u2019s legal team to back up his out-of-court claims that the FBI planted evidence. \u201cThere shall be no separate requirement on Plaintiff at this stage, prior to the review of any of the Seized Materials, to lodge ex ante final objections to the accuracy of Defendant\u2019s Inventory, its descriptions, or its contents,\u201d Cannon wrote, noting that her order appointing a special master contemplated only the government filing a declaration verifying the accuracy of the inventory. \u201cShould any additional matters surface during the Special Master\u2019s review process that require reconsideration of the Inventory or the need to object to its contents, the parties shall make those matters known to the Special Master for appropriate resolution and recommendation to this Court,\u201d Cannon said. DOJ declares seized Mar-a-Lago materials list full and accurate despite Trump's claims of planted evidence Trump had pushed back against the requested declaration, while the Justice Department had indicated it supported the requirement. In another boost for Trump, Cannon said Trump\u2019s legal team does not have to provide certain details about his executive privilege claims in the special master review. The federal judge removed the special master\u2019s proposed requirement that Trump, when asserting a document is covered by executive privilege, specify whether he believed that barred disclosure within the executive branch versus disclosure outside of it. The Justice Department has argued that Trump\u2019s executive privilege claims are especially weak because the materials were seized by the executive branch for an executive branch purpose, i.e. a DOJ criminal investigation. Dearie had proposed that Trump log seized items in categories more specific than what Cannon\u2019s order appointing the special master had laid out. Trump objected to making the executive privilege distinction Dearie proposed. Cannon adopted other aspects of Dearie\u2019s plan for how the documents should be categorized. In explaining the \u201cmodest enlargement\u201d of the timeline, Cannon pointed to the issues the parties had faced in securing a vendor to digitize the seized materials for the review. Earlier this week, the department said in a court filing that Trump\u2019s team had indicated the data hosting companies didn\u2019t want to work with the former President. Trump\u2019s team now says the issue is the size of the evidence collection. \u201cIn conversations between Plaintiff\u2019s counsel and the Government regarding a data vendor, the Government mentioned that the 11,000 documents contain closer to 200,000 pages. That estimated volume, with a need to operate under the accelerated timeframes supported by the Government, is the reason why so many of the Government\u2019s selected vendors have declined the potential engagement,\u201d Trump\u2019s team wrote on Wednesday. Cannon referenced the characterization of the 200,000 pages in ordering the postponed deadlines. She also nixed the idea of the special master reviewing privilege assertions in tranches.The judge additionally made clear that any motions from Trump to seek the return of property he contends was unlawfully seized would be considered on her docket. Dearie, had opened the door to that litigation happening before Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who approved the search warrant \u2013 a move that Trump opposed.

            "article_content": "It is dusk on a crisp, perfect fall evening, and at the end of the long gravel driveway, Cindy Deppe is waiting with a smile and a choice: Screen One or Screen Two. She\u2019s running the ticket booth at Becky\u2019s Drive-In, a Lehigh Valley treasure. The family-owned business for 76 years now, is a throwback and a survivor in a slice of America that is a very different place than it was when William Beck first fired up the projector on this site in 1946. Bethlehem Steel anchored the Lehigh Valley economy then, along with the Atlas Cement Company. Democrats dominated local politics. But nowadays in Northampton County, the home of Walnutport,  times \u2013 and politics \u2013 have changed. \u201cThis area,\u201d Cindy\u2019s son, Christopher Deppe, put it, is the battleground within the battleground. Walnutport is a borough in Northampton County. It is a mostly rural county dotted with farms and small towns - 377 square miles in all - but also home to the small and smaller cities Bethlehem and Easton. Barack Obama carried Northampton County twice. Donald Trump won it in 2016, and Joe Biden narrowly flipped Northampton County back to blue in 2020. Only 25 counties in America share that voting pattern. This year,  Northampton County will be a place to watch on Election Night, first because of its history as a Pennsylvania bellwether, but also because the 8 p.m. ET poll closing time means it will be among the first swing counties to report results. As Deppe runs the digital projectors on this Friday night, he breaks an unwritten family rule, half grimacing, half grinning. \u201cI have made my choices: I\u2019m rooting for Shapiro and John Fetterman,\u201d he says, referring to Josh Shapiro, the Democratic candidate for Pennsylvania governor, and Fetterman the Democratic Senate nominee. \u201cIf you drive around this area you are likely to see more Mastriano and Dr. Oz signs, but I really do think those people are in the vocal minority.\u201d Only three times in the last century has the Northampton County winner in a presidential race not also carried the commonwealth and won the White House. Competitive of late is an understatement: Trump carried the county by 3.4 percent in 2016. Four years later, Biden eked out a 1,233 vote county win \u2014a margin of less than one percentage point. That explains that unwritten family rule of not talking politics at Becky\u2019s Drive In. \u201cPeople are pretty heated,\u201d Dean Deppe, Christopher\u2019s father and Cindy\u2019s husband, says as he fills orders at the refreshment stand. \u201cWe try to minimize it because, you know, we don\u2019t want to disengage half our customer base.\u201d Casual conversations with movie goers Friday night ranged from liberal college students to a Trump-voting grandfather who ended talk of politics politely but quickly \u201cbecause it just riles me up.\u201d The leaves are beginning to change colors, which means the screens will soon go dark until spring. And it means Northampton County will soon help answer several pressing midterm questions. The Pennsylvania governor appoints the Secretary of State, and Republican Doug Mastriano is an election denier who tried to help Trump overturn the state\u2019s 2020 count here. Plus, the Fetterman-Oz race could settle which party controls the Senate come January. And all of Northampton County is in Pennsylvania\u2019s 7th Congressional District, an early, Eastern time zone test of whether vulnerable Democrats are able to hang on in a midterm climate that historically is unkind to members of the incumbent President\u2019s party. Rep. Susan Wild is the Democratic incumbent here. She won with 52% in 2020 and faces the same Republican opponent in 2022. The district lines were redrawn a bit after the last census, and the new territory leans heavily red. \u201cI know what history says,\u201d Wild, who was first elected in the last midterm cycle in 2018, tells CNN. \u201cThis is a different kind of year.. \u2026 I don\u2019t think the old rules apply anymore.\u201d One old rule is that turnout drops in midterm years, and the party out of power usually benefits from higher enthusiasm. Wild\u2019s Saturday visit to the Easton Farmers\u2019 Market was part of an effort to make sure that dropoff doesn\u2019t happen this year. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to vote. November 8\u201d is her refrain as she wanders from vendor to vendor to say hello and make her case. One stand is selling indigenous Latin American bags and art. \u201cNice to see you. You live here in Easton?\u2019\u201d Wild asks. \u201cI do,\u201d is the response. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great place,\u201d Wild says. And it\u2019s critical to Democratic math. Easton is one of just two reliably Democratic pieces of this complicated county. Bethlehem is the other. In a county that is 86% White, according to the Census Bureau \u2013 and with race and education among the most telling divides in American politics \u2013 Easton is 67% White and by far the most diverse slice of the county. Biden won every Easton voting ward handily; his smallest margin of victory was 24 points. Bethlehem, too, is a deep blue piece of Northampton County. It has more than 75,000 residents \u2013 nearly 25% of the county total population \u2013 and it is 79% White. Further, 42% of Bethlehem residents have a least a bachelor\u2019s degree; the county average is 32%. Much of Bethlehem has a suburban feel, and at a rally on Saturday, Wild turned to the issue Democrats believe just might help them defy midterm history. \u201cMy opponent has said that she is open to national ban on abortion,\u201d Wild told the crowd at Northampton Community College. In the gym, the line was well received. Across the street from campus, Chad Horton held a sign making clear inflation is more important to him. Covid-19 restrictions backed by Democrats also shape his midterm mood. \u201cSusan Wild has definitely not earned the privilege of being reelected,\u201d Horton said. \u201cThey put people out of work. I\u2019m going to put them out of work.\u201d Businesswoman Lisa Scheller is Wild\u2019s opponent - and very much hopes the old midterm rules do apply. One Scheller TV ad opens with grainy images of Wild, President Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. \u201cThe Biden Democrats are hurting Pennsylvania families with their radical agenda,\u201d the narrator says. A second ad strikes a similar theme: \u201cBiden and Pelosi\u2019s economic polices are hurting us. Susan Wild is with them.\u201d Wild\u2019s counter, in a TV ad and every time she can when talking to voters, is to call herself a bipartisan moderate. \u201cI grew up in a household with a dad who was a conservative Republican and a mom who was a liberal Democrat,\u201d she tells a man who recalled seeing the TV ad. \u201cSo I guess I was born to be bipartisan.\u201d Wild knows the stakes here come Election Night. Republicans are sending in late money, and in the neighboring 8th Congressional District, where Democrat Matt Cartwright is also in a 2020 rematch and also in a race rated as a tossup. \u201cIf you see on election night that Matt Cartwright and I have held our seats, then you are going to see that the Democrats hold on to their majority in the House,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cThese are truly two of the most pivotal races in the entire country.\u201d Mount Bethel is an 18-mile drive from Easton, following PA 611 up the banks of the Delaware River. It gets more rural by the mile, and by the time the highway bends away from the river, it is clear where Trump got many of the votes to almost overcome the big Biden edges in Easton and Bethlehem. Trump ran it up in tiny Mount Bethel, which is 92% White, winning one of its voting districts by 45 points. Like Becky\u2019s Drive-In, the Mt. Bethel Diner is a throwback. A counter with vinyl stools, the walls lined with vintage booths. A menu of hearty breakfast staples, and a waitress quick to bring coffee and a warm welcome. But there is a modern-day exception to the throwback theme: When we ask if we can talk to patrons about their midterm votes, the owner says no \u2013 that CNN isn\u2019t welcome here. She says Trump won, and we don\u2019t tell the truth. Pen Argyl is just shy of 10 miles away, PA 611 to PA 512. Biden lost big here, too. And you are far more likely to see Republican lawn signs. \u201cWe\u2019re just a little hick town,\u201d local barber John Cuono says. \u201cThere\u2019s about 3,000 people here.\u201d Cuono has cut hair in this same spot since his discharge from the Navy 59 years ago, first working with his father, then taking over the small shop on West Main Street. \u201cThey are not into it like the used to be,\u201d he said of talking politics with customers. \u201cAll they are is a downer.\u201d Cuono is a registered Democrat but voted for Trump twice. \u201cWell, he did as heck of a job,\u201d the 86-year-old says. \u201cI liked what he was doing.\u201d Cuono reads the newspapers and watches the news. He knows about all the Trump investigations and does not dispute that Trump tried to stay in power after the election was certified for Biden. \u201cI look at it this way: he got caught,\u201d Cuono said. \u201cBut how many other presidents did the same thing and didn\u2019t get caught. You know. We don\u2019t know.\u201d Would he vote Trump again? \u201cI\u2019m really not sure. I\u2019d have to hear what he has to say and who is running against him.\u201d Local newspapers are sprinkled around the barber shop, and Cuono says he is debating his 2022 choices. He is still undecided in the governor\u2019s race and says likely to  decide in the voting booth. \u201cI think I am going to go with Dr. Oz,\u201d is his take on the Senate race. \u201cHe knows a little bit about life. \u2026I don\u2019t know about Fetterman. I don\u2019t know much about the man.\u201d Of Wild, his Democratic congresswoman, Cuono says: \u201cShe is a whirlwind. \u2026 Sometime she is alright. Sometimes she\u2019s bad. \u2026I\u2019m not sure on her.\u201d The drive in this part of the county is telling. There are still some Trump-Pence 2020 signs hanging, plus flags and placards deriding Biden, some by full name, some by the initials \u201cFJB\u201d and some by his favorite MAGA nickname. One homemade sign along the roadside in Bangor suggested, in red spray paint, this antidote to inflation: \u201cMake Everything 1/2 Price Again Trump 2024.\u201d First, complicated but critical Northampton County gets to deliver its 2022 verdict.",

            "article_content": "The newest addition to former President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team, Chris Kise, has been sidelined from the Mar-a-Lago documents investigation less than a month after he was brought on to represent Trump in the matter, two sources familiar with the move tell CNN. Kise is expected to remain on Trump\u2019s legal team but is not leading the work related to the federal government\u2019s investigation into how the former President handled 11,000 documents seized from his Florida home in August following a lengthy effort by the government to retrieve them. The reason for the shift in Kise\u2019s role remains unclear and he may instead focus his efforts on the other investigations Trump is facing, which range from his business practices to the January 6 insurrection. DOJ declares seized Mar-a-Lago materials list full and accurate despite Trump's claims of planted evidence The move is notable given Kise, the former solicitor general for Florida, was brought on to the team after a weeks-long search and struggle to find someone willing to take on the case who was also experienced in Florida law. The legal strategy for fighting the Justice Department following the August seizure of over 100 documents marked as classified was also in disarray. Kise\u2019s hiring came with an unusual price tag of $3 million, paid for by Trump\u2019s outside spending arm. The retainer fee, paid upfront, raised eyebrows among other lawyers on Trump\u2019s team, given the former President has a developed a reputation for not paying his legal fees. His sidelining will likely be read as another setback for Trump as he faces multiple investigations. Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said: \u201cChris Kise\u2019s role as an important member of President Trump\u2019s legal team remains unchanged, and any suggestion otherwise is untrue.\u201d Kise did not respond to a request for comment. Kise had been viewed among Trump contacts as a serious white-collar attorney and trial lawyer, with Florida court chops. Before he came aboard, other lawyers on Trump\u2019s team were perceived in legal circles to have made serious missteps in the investigation, such as not fully recognizing the legal risk of the documents investigation before the search of Mar-a-Lago, telling investigators all classified records had been turned over, missing opportunities to argue for executive privilege and having an appeals court deliver a drubbing against Trump\u2019s bid to block classified documents in the investigation. Exclusive: Trump's secret court fight to stop grand jury from getting information from his inner circle So far, Kise doesn\u2019t appear to be deeply involved Trump\u2019s other most serious criminal investigative risk \u2013 the Justice Department\u2019s January 6 investigation. Kise was not present in a DC federal courthouse last week alongside three other Trump attorneys who are arguing for confidentiality around Trump\u2019s conversations at the end of his presidency. They are attempting to block a federal grand jury from gathering information from an expanding circle of close Trump aides about his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Kise left his large law firm that he had been with for more than a decade, Foley & Lardner, to take the job as a solo practitioner. He previously worked for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 transition team and has won four cases before the Supreme Court. CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Ask most politicians why they run for president and you are likely to get an answer that sounds something like, \u201cI wanted to do the most good for the most people as possible,\u201d or something similar. Donald Trump is not most politicians. Trump, in an interview with the New York Times\u2019 Maggie Haberman for her forthcoming book, \u201cConfidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America,\u201d revealed the \u201cwhy\u201d behind his past and (likely) future bids for the nation\u2019s highest office. \u201cThe question I get asked more than any other question: \u2018If you had it to do again, would you have done it?\u2019\u201d Trump told Haberman. \u201cThe answer is, yeah, I think so. Because here\u2019s the way I look at it. I have so many rich friends and nobody knows who they are.\u201d OK. So, just to be crystal clear here \u2013 Trump is saying that if he had it to do all over, he would run for president again because it made him more famous. That the key motivation for him to run for president was to be well-known \u2013 and it worked. That\u2019s a startlingly honest admission \u2013 even for Trump. He didn\u2019t even attempt to go for a more traditional answer like, I don\u2019t know, helping people or seeing policies he believed in enacted and executed. Just right to the purely personal. Which, knowing what we know of Trump, probably shouldn\u2019t be all that surprising. He is someone who is uniquely self-centered and spent much of his presidency running the government like his own private fiefdom. There were \u201cmy generals\u201d and \u201cmy military.\u201d The expectations that the Justice Department would pursue his political enemies and act at his behest. (Sidebar: Trump, as president, would regularly riff on how much money being president was costing him. \u201cThis thing is costing me a fortune, being president,\u201d he said at a rally in Pennsylvania in 2019. \u201cIt\u2019s probably costing me from $3 to $5 billion for the privilege of being \u2013 and I couldn\u2019t care less \u2013 I don\u2019t care. You know if you\u2019re wealthy, it doesn\u2019t matter. I just want to do a great job.\u201d) For Trump, the presidency was a means to a personal end: to make him more famous, more marketable, a bigger deal. Which is how Trump viewed everything that happened to him in his life \u2013 a chance to go bigger, get richer. Always more, more, more. \u201cThe show is Trump, and it is sold-out performances everywhere,\u201d he told Playboy magazine all the way back in 1990, in one of the most revealing quotes of his life. At the start of his presidency, there was an active debate as to whether Trump would bend his way to the conventions of the presidency or whether he would force the presidency to warp to his will. Looking back in hindsight, it\u2019s clear Trump did the latter, forcing his desire for fame and power onto the White House for four years. To think anything would be different if he gets four more years in the job after the 2024 election is a fool\u2019s errand.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys are fighting a secret court battle to block a federal grand jury from gathering information from an expanding circle of close Trump aides about his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, people briefed on the matter told CNN. The high-stakes legal dispute \u2013 which included the appearance of three attorneys representing Trump at the Washington, DC, federal courthouse on Thursday afternoon \u2013 is the most aggressive step taken by the former President to assert executive and attorney-client privileges in order to prevent some witnesses from sharing information in the criminal investigation events surrounding January 6, 2021. The court fight over privilege, which has not been previously reported and is under seal, is a turning point for Trump\u2019s post-presidency legal woes. How the fight is resolved could determine whether prosecutors can tear down the firewall Trump has tried to keep around his conversations in the West Wing and with attorneys he spoke to as he sought to overturn the 2020 election and they worked to help him hold onto the presidency. This dispute came to light as former Trump White House adviser and lawyer Eric Herschmann received a grand jury subpoena seeking testimony, the people briefed said. Trump allies launch new super PAC to bolster GOP candidates in midterms as former President eyes 2024 campaign Other former senior Trump White House officials, including former White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy Patrick Philbin, appeared before the grand jury in recent weeks, after negotiating specific subjects they would decline to answer question about, because of Trump\u2019s privilege claims. Herschmann himself is not in court fighting the subpoena. Instead, Trump\u2019s lawyers are asking a judge to recognize the former President\u2019s privilege claims and the right to confidentiality around  his dealings. Herschmann\u2019s grand jury testimony has been postponed. It\u2019s still unknown if prosecutors want to use the information for possible cases against Trump or others. Trump\u2019s lawyers have expected the Justice Department to eventually seek a judge\u2019s order to compel additional testimony from White House witnesses, CNN has previously reported. The Justice Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. Under grand jury secrecy rules, the legal dispute is under seal, with no public documents to show the state of play. The Justice Department has been girding for a legal challenge along these lines for months, CNN previously reported. In addition to Cipollone and Philbin, former vice presidential aides Greg Jacob and Marc Short have appeared before the grand jury in the DC courthouse and declined to answer some questions because of Trump\u2019s executive privilege claims, CNN previously reported. Trump's strategy in the classified documents case is quickly crumbling On Thursday afternoon, Evan Corcoran, Tim Parlatore and John Rowley, who work together representing Trump in the January 6 probe, exited the courthouse accompanied by a law clerk. Parlatore told reporters he was there \u201crepresenting a client\u201d but would provide no further details. The other lawyers declined to comment. The Trump legal team\u2019s push to broadly assert privilege has been subject of disagreement among its lawyers over legal strategy, people briefed on the matter said. Herschmann received a grand jury subpoena for testimony and documents related to January 6 weeks ago. But he was irked before his court date by what he saw as vague guidance from Trump lawyers not to share information, people briefed on the matter say. Herschmann pushed Trump lawyers to provide him with more detailed instructions for which topics to assert privilege over, according to emails reviewed by CNN and first reported by The New York Times. \u201cA letter directive from President Trump without a court order would not be sufficient. I don\u2019t understand your statement that the chief judge will decide the issue,\u201d Herschmann wrote. He then raised concerns about DOJ seeking to compel his testimony if he refused to testify to certain questions. Herschmann previously testified to the House committee about what he saw at the White House around January 6. The outspoken lawyer expressed concerns that the Trump team\u2019s approach potentially put him at risk for grand jury contempt, according to people briefed on the matter. He pushed back when Trump\u2019s lawyers sent him a letter with instructions that he cite executive or attorney-client privileges to the grand jury. Other former Trump aides have expressed similar frustration at the vagueness of the Trump privilege claim, people briefed on the matter tell CNN. Attorney-client privilege claims can be overcome for a number of reasons, including if any information is shared outside of the attorney-client pipeline and if the communication relates to possible wrongdoing. In the January 6 situation, a federal judge in California has already found email exchanges to and from John Eastman, Trump\u2019s election attorney, wouldn\u2019t be covered by this confidentiality, providing the records to House investigators and allowing the Justice Department to access those and other similar exchanges. Mar-a-Lago special master orders Trump team to back up any claims of FBI 'planting' evidence Executive privilege is a tougher pursuit for investigators, though not impossible to overcome. The Justice Department gained access to Nixon\u2019s Watergate tapes for a federal grand jury in the 1970s because of a Supreme Court ruling that the criminal investigation needed the materials. But courts haven\u2019t hammered out exactly where the lines would be drawn in this investigation, or for a former President who may try to keep secret advice he was given while leading the country. The dispute is separate from privilege protections Trump has tried to claim in the separate investigation of handling of federal records and national security information after his presidency. That investigation prompted the FBI to seize classified documents from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort, and a judge acting as a special master is now working through the more than 10,000 non-classified records to determine if Trump can block them from investigators. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb and Andrew Millman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has complied with a subpoena from the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into events surrounding January 6, 2021, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN, making him the highest-ranking Trump official known to have responded to a subpoena in the federal investigation. Meadows turned over the same materials he provided to the House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack, one source said, meeting the obligations of the Justice Department subpoena, which has not been previously reported. Last year, Meadows turned over thousands of text messages and emails to the House committee, before he stopped cooperating. The texts he handed over between Election Day 2020 and Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, which CNN previously obtained, provided a window into his dealings at the White House, though he withheld hundreds of messages, citing executive privilege. In addition to Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, one of Meadows\u2019 top deputies in the White House, Ben Williamson, also recently received a grand jury subpoena, another source familiar with the matter tells CNN. That subpoena was similar to what others in Trump\u2019s orbit received. It asked for testimony and records relating to January 6 and efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Williamson previously cooperated with the January 6 committee. He declined to comment to CNN. Jeffrey Clark told DC Bar that DOJ search of his home linked to false statements, conspiracy, obstruction investigation Meadows\u2019 compliance with the subpoena comes as the Justice Department has ramped up its investigation related to January 6, which now touches nearly every aspect of former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss \u2013 including the fraudulent electors plot, efforts to push baseless election fraud claims and how money flowed to support these various efforts, CNN reported this week. An attorney for Meadows declined comment. The Justice Department did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Federal investigators have issued at least 30 subpoenas to individuals with connections to Trump, including top officials from his fundraising and former campaign operation. As White House chief of staff, Meadows was in the middle of Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election in the two months between Election Day and Biden\u2019s inauguration. Meadows communicated with numerous officials who tried to find election fraud and pushed various schemes to try to overturn the election, according to text messages obtained by CNN that Meadows turned over to the House select committee. Meadows also shared baseless conspiracy theories with Justice Department leaders as Trump tried to enlist DOJ\u2019s help in his push to claim the election was stolen from him. After Meadows stopped cooperating with the House committee, Congress referred him to the Justice Department for contempt of Congress. DOJ declined to prosecute him for contempt earlier this year. It\u2019s not yet clear whether the Justice Department will seek more materials from Meadows as part of the ongoing criminal investigation, which could lead to a legal fight over executive privilege. Following last month\u2019s FBI search of Trump\u2019s Florida residence and resort, Meadows handed over texts and emails to the National Archives that he had not previously turned over from his time in the administration, CNN previously reported. Last year, Meadows spoke with Trump about the documents he brought to Mar-a-Lago that the National Archives wanted returned. Trump has been counseled to cut contact with Meadows, and some of Trump\u2019s attorneys believe Meadows could also be in investigators\u2019 crosshairs and are concerned he could become a fact witness if he\u2019s pushed to cooperate, CNN reported last month. Still, Trump and Meadows have spoken a number of times, according to a source familiar with their relationship. Another source described their relationship as \u201cnot the same as it once was\u201d while in the White House, but said they still have maintained a relationship, even as Trump has complained about Meadows to others.",

            "article_content": "A strikingly broad subpoena sweep against more than 30 former officials and campaign aides of ex-President Donald Trump represents the clearest sign yet of the seriousness of the Department of Justice\u2019s criminal probe into events surrounding the US Capitol insurrection. The gambit, revealed on Monday, also shows that while Trump may succeed in slowing a separate investigation into the retention of classified information at Mar-a-Lago, his potential exposure to legal consequences is deep and threatening. Trump has not been charged with a crime in either probe. But the subpoenas show that the DOJ\u2019s investigation, which has proceeded behind the scenes for months and caused Trump critics to express frustration with Attorney General Merrick Garland, is far more expansive than was previously known. And it appears to be intensifying, with investigators apparently narrowing their focus based on other subpoenas, evidence and witness testimony. Tracking Trump's ongoing investigations, civil suits and countersuits \u201cThis is the way classic investigations are conducted, moving up the chain so to speak,\u201d David Laufman, former chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett Monday. \u201cThey are now encompassing individuals closer and closer to the President to learn more and more about what the President knew and when he knew it.\u201d The twice-impeached former President has typically been successful at wriggling free of legal scrutiny and scandals that would long have ended the careers of conventional politicians. But it is clear that he is facing legal concerns on multiple fronts, some related to his attempt to overthrow the result of the 2020 election, and all in some ways arising from his view that as president, and even back in civilian life, his position granted him almost unlimited power free of scrutiny. News of the more than 30 new subpoenas for documents and some for testimony before a grand jury suggest the DOJ is investigating a scheme to create slates of fake electors to invalidate President Joe Biden\u2019s wins in swing states in 2020. There are also indications that prosecutors are looking at Trump\u2019s fundraising operation and the way that the ex-President\u2019s January 6, 2021, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally was organized, according to new information reported by CNN, some of which was first revealed by The New York Times. Justice Department subpoenas more than 30 people in Trump's orbit in January 6 probe The flurry of subpoenas in recent days came just ahead of a 60-day quiet period that the DOJ generally seeks to avoid the appearance of influencing elections with politically sensitive investigations. Midterm elections in November will decide the destiny of the Senate and the House of Representatives and multiple state and local positions. Trump, touting his false claims that he was illegally ejected from power in a fraudulent election, has been a key player in the 2022 campaign. Trump acolytes who received subpoenas include his former campaign manager Bill Stepien and Sean Dollman, the campaign\u2019s former chief financial officer, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump\u2019s former deputy chief of staff and social media guru Dan Scavino also received a subpoena, according to a source familiar with the matter. None of the three men responded to requests for comment. Brian Jack, the last White House political director under Trump, was subpoenaed as well, according to a source familiar with the situation. Jack also did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The revelation comes as the House select committee probing the January 6 insurrection meets on Tuesday to discuss next steps in its investigation and possible new televised hearings following a series of scripted sessions over the summer that painted a deeply damning picture of Trump\u2019s behavior following the last election. January 6 committee set to meet in person on Tuesday as it debates whether to invite Trump and Pence to appear The committee is expected to discuss whether to invite Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence to appear. Committee members do not expect either man to testify, sources said, but some believe they should be asked for the record given the extraordinary circumstances of the former President\u2019s attempt to thwart the peaceful transfer of power after a democratic election. This subplot is also playing out amid an investigation in Georgia into alleged attempts to try to get local officials to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the critical swing state. All these probes have in recent days been overshadowed by yet another legal duel over Trump\u2019s hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, which led to a prolonged standoff with the DOJ and eventually resulted in an FBI search of his property last month. Trump asks judge to reject DOJ's request to continue to review documents seized from Mar-a-Lago Lawyers for the former President argued in a new filing in that case on Monday that a judge should reject the DOJ\u2019s attempt to continue to review classified material as part of its criminal investigation. The department says that the judge\u2019s original prohibition against it doing so effectively makes it impossible for the intelligence community to assess the potential damage from the former President\u2019s apparently lax handling of classified information and presents a grave risk to national security. In a characteristically expansive interpretation of the position of president, Trump argued in a Monday filing that in his former position, he had broad authority to declassify records and that a former president, should have \u201cabsolute right of access\u201d to presidential records \u2013 whether they are classified or not. CNN has reported that multiple former senior national security officials dismiss the idea that the ex-President had some kind of scheme to declassify documents en masse. And even if he had, the Presidential Records Act states that presidential documents belong in the National Archives. But in an audacious move, Trump\u2019s legal team sought to downplay the significance of the dispute. \u201cIn what at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control, the Government wrongfully seeks to criminalize the possession by the 45th President of his own Presidential and personal records,\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team wrote to Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee who is presiding over the case as Trump seeks to have a third-party attorney known as a special master sift through the documents for privilege issues. Justice Department open to one of Trump's proposed candidates for special master review Each of the Trump team\u2019s claims is highly contentious and appear to conflict with most conventional readings of US law. The argument that Mar-a-Lago was a secure facility and that the evidence was kept in a locked room appears to ignore the fact that some of the 100 documents taken by the FBI from Trump\u2019s home bore the highest levels of classification of the US government and would normally be permitted to be viewed only by a select level of official in the most highly secured venues. And the Washington Post reported last week that the secrets of a foreign nation\u2019s nuclear program was among information the FBI took from his residence. Such intelligence would be among the most highly protected and restricted information in the government\u2019s possession. Trump\u2019s arguments might appear in many cases to be outlandish. But they could also achieve something he wants \u2013 delaying any potential formal legal moves against him for as long as possible by opening up even more appeals in layers of the court system. In the case of the classified documents drama, that could mean the case stretches well into the 2024 campaign when Trump is expected to mount a bid to win back the White House. The former President has already slammed the DOJ\u2019s action as an example of political persecution, a charge he would be certain to escalate during the heat of a run for the presidency. But the new indications on Monday of the comprehensive nature of the investigations into the lead up to January 6 raise the question of just how long Trump can keep at bay the multiple investigations arising from his inability to accept his 2020 loss.

            "article_content": "The Florida judge who disrupted the Justice Department\u2019s probe into Donald Trump\u2019s hoarding of classified material faces critical decisions this week in a legal tangle deepened by her granting the ex-President a big win in court last week. The showdown over the appointment of a so-called special master is, so far, having just the effect Trump wants by slowing the investigation that led to FBI agents searching Mar-a-Lago last month. The Justice Department has already appealed that decision, which prosecutors had vigorously opposed and had opened up Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, to criticism from some legal analysts, including Trump\u2019s own former attorney general, William Barr. What's happening -- and what's next -- in the Mar-a-Lago probe Last week, the DOJ asked Cannon to reverse her decision to bar the FBI and DOJ prosecutors from using material taken from Trump\u2019s home until the special master \u2013 a third party appointed to oversee evidence \u2013 had vetted it. It argued that the prohibition posed an unacceptable threat to national security.  Monday morning, lawyers for Trump urged Cannon to reject the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to continue to review seized documents. And as a separate joint filing made clear on Friday, neither side can even agree on who the special master should be, what they should examine, how long the review should last and who should pay for it. More legal filings could push the probe closer to the 2024 presidential campaign \u2013 a sensitive political matter since Trump is giving every sign he intends to be a candidate and has claimed the drama is a politically motivated attempt to keep him from winning a second White House term. In a reminder of the stakes involved, a forthcoming book by New York Times reporter and CNN political analyst Maggie Haberman reveals that Trump, in the aftermath of the 2020 election, said he would remain in the White House rather than let incoming President Joe Biden take over, a shocking disregard for longstanding American political precedent. Trump is within his rights to fight for a special master, even if many legal experts argue that it\u2019s clear the information he had belongs to the government and not him. But the former President also has a long record in his political and business career of exhausting the system of appeals to the fullest extent of the legal system, often in order to delay a moment when he might face accountability. His latest gambits and some of Cannon\u2019s own writings in the case have sparked criticism that he\u2019s getting special treatment. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, for instance, warned Sunday that he should be treated just like any other citizen. \u201cI do think that, just like any American, if there is evidence, that evidence should be pursued,\u201d Clinton, whom Trump defeated in 2016, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. Takeaways from the Trump and DOJ Mar-a-Lago special master court filing In Cannon\u2019s order last Monday, she had said that while prosecutors could not use material taken from Trump\u2019s resort until they had been reviewed by the special master for legal and executive privilege issues, a review by intelligence agencies into possible damage to national security could continue. The DOJ, however, argued that was impractical. In its filing late Thursday, which added up to a comprehensive critique of Cannon\u2019s reasoning, the department argued that it and the FBI\u2019s work on the criminal investigation could not be separated from the parallel probe by the intelligence community. In essence, they argued that the FBI and the DOJ are an integral part of the intelligence community. And they warned that the loss of the ability to examine whether critical intelligence had been jeopardized by Trump could cause grave damage. \u201cThe government and the public are irreparably injured when a criminal investigation of matters involving risks to national security is enjoined,\u201d the department argued when giving its notice of an appeal. And it also served notice that the DOJ will seek the intervention of the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals if Cannon does not grant its request to suspend parts of her ruling by September 15. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner, the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that key congressional leaders had still not been briefed on potential intelligence vulnerabilities at Mar-a-Lago because of the tussle over the special master going on in Cannon\u2019s court. \u201cWe have not been briefed. We expect to be briefed,\u201d the Virginia Democrat told Bash. \u201cI think we\u2019ll get some clarity on that in a couple days, and we expect to get that briefing,\u201d he added. But the latest legal wrangling between Trump\u2019s team and the DOJ is to some extent obscuring the core question about the case: why did Trump keep classified documents, some bearing the designations of the government\u2019s most closely guarded secrets in apparently unsecured conditions at a private home? The mystery became even more acute when the Washington Post reported last week that the documents taken away from Mar-a-Lago by the FBI included details of a foreign power\u2019s nuclear program. The way that Trump kept such documents, in a storage room or in his office with personal memorabilia, according to unsealed court documents, could be deeply consequential. In some circumstances, even the possibility that classified information was compromised could cause intelligence agencies to shut down operations abroad to protect sources and methods or even foreign assets who may need to go dormant or be extracted from vulnerable positions. Cannon had given Trump\u2019s legal team until Monday at 10 a.m. to file a formal response to the DOJ\u2019s request that she suspend parts of her special master order. \u201cThe application of the injunction to classified records would thus frustrate the government\u2019s ability to conduct an effective national security risk assessment and classification review and could preclude the government from taking necessary remedial steps in light of that review \u2013 risking irreparable harm to our national security and intelligence interests,\u201d the DOJ wrote in its request for a stay. The department also argued that the injunction prevented the FBI from identifying any additional classified records that were not being properly stored at Mar-a-Lago and pointed to empty folders marked with \u201cclassified\u201d banners that were found during the FBI\u2019s search of Trump\u2019s residence. Exclusive: 'I'm just not going to leave': New book reveals Trump vowed to stay in White House \u201cThe FBI would be chiefly responsible for investigating what materials may have once been stored in these folders and whether they may have been lost or compromised \u2013 steps that, again, may require the use of grand jury subpoenas, search warrants, and other criminal investigative tools and could lead to evidence that would also be highly relevant to advancing the criminal investigation,\u201d the DOJ said in its filing to the judge. The department\u2019s argument implicitly makes the point to the judge that classified documents are in themselves the property of the US government and not of the former President. Some of Trump\u2019s allies have suggested that he had previously declassified all the documents found at Mar-a-Lago. But there is no evidence that this ever took place. In fact, 18 former top Trump administration officials told CNN they never heard any such order issued during their time working for Trump, and that they believe the claim to be false. And even if Trump had declassified material, US law states that presidential documents are not the property of the person who sat in the Oval Office but should be sent to the National Archives when a presidency ends. Trump\u2019s legal team countered: \u201cIn what at its core is a document storage dispute that has spiraled out of control, the Government wrongfully seeks to criminalize the possession by the 45th President of his own Presidential and personal records.\u201d Trump has not been charged with a crime. But the unsealed FBI search warrant of his home revealed the investigation is related to at least three potential violations of the law \u2013 including of the Espionage Act, obstruction of justice and criminal handling of government records. The extraordinary spectacle of a former President\u2019s home being searched by the FBI \u2013 after prolonged efforts by the government to get classified and other material back \u2013 has renewed questions of whether Trump could face criminal charges. This is hardly the only investigation involving the former President. The Justice Department also has a separate investigation into events leading up to and surrounding the Capitol insurrection. And there is yet another probe under way in Georgia into the alleged efforts by Trump and his team to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in a critical swing state. Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump should be treated as any other citizen in DOJ investigation The possibility of Trump\u2019s potential criminal liability was taken up on Sunday by Clinton, whom Trump frequently said should be locked up after some classified material was found on her private email server dating to emails sent to her by staff when she was secretary of state. The FBI said in 2016 that of 30,000 emails Clinton provided to the State Department from her server, 110 contained classified information at the time they were sent or received. Then-FBI Director James Comey criticized Clinton for carelessness but concluded that no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case against her on the basis of evidence found and applicable laws. While Trump\u2019s supporters have argued he should get the same treatment as Clinton, the cases do not appear directly analogous. \u201cHe\u2019s not the president and we do have some special exceptions for someone actually in the office,\u201d Clinton said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d referring to the former President. \u201cSo, I do think that, just like any American, if there is evidence, that evidence should be pursued,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI know it\u2019s not an easy call. And so, I don\u2019t want to inject my opinion into that difficult calculation. Because I don\u2019t know all the facts. And unlike people who jump to conclusions, I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut if the evidence proves or seems to show that there are charges that should be leveled, then I think the rule of law should apply to anyone.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "The Justice Department and former President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers faced off yet again in the Mar-a-Lago investigation, this time in a court filing late Friday where they offered vastly different proposals for how the critical special master review of seized documents should work. Although the document Friday appeared on the court docket as a \u201cjoint response,\u201d the two sides unsurprisingly didn\u2019t agree on much. READ: DOJ and Trump team proposals for special master review The new filing revealed the names of the former judges and one lawyer that the respective sides proposed to serve as special master \u2013 the third-party attorney reviewing the documents. The candidates bring some interesting experience to the table \u2013 one co-wrote a report debunking Trump\u2019s 2020 election lies, and another was involved in the controversial surveillance of an aide for Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. It\u2019ll be up to US District Judge Aileen Cannon to figure out the path forward in the legal fight that could determine how far the Justice Department is able to proceed in its investigation of how White House documents ended up at Mar-a-Lago. Here are the takeaways from Friday\u2019s court filing: Trump\u2019s team is requesting an expansive independent review, to filter out documents that are attorney-client privileged or that fall under executive privilege. Federal prosecutors don\u2019t want the executive privilege review to occur, and they don\u2019t want the special master to even see any of the 100-plus classified records that were seized from Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors also say the special master should \u201csubmit to NARA,\u201d the National Archives and Records Administration, any documents that Trump claims are covered under executive privilege, and consult with the agency \u201con the determination of Presidential records.\u201d (NARA previously rejected Trump\u2019s executive privilege claims for materials, including classified documents, that he eventually turned over voluntarily in January.) Judge throws out Trump's sprawling lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, ex-FBI officials over Russia probe Trump\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, want the special master to review \u201call seized materials,\u201d including classified records. They also want the special master to \u201cevaluate potential executive privilege claims\u201d in the documents. And they said there is no reason why the special master \u201cshould, or needs to\u201d consult with NARA about anything. Thomas Griffith, served on the prestigious DC Circuit Court of Appeals from 2005 to 2020. In one of his final major rulings before retiring, he wrote the majority opinion rejecting House Democrats\u2019 attempt to subpoena Trump\u2019s former White House Counsel Don McGahn. (The decision was later overturned.) Since his retirement, Griffith co-authored a report alongside other prominent conservative lawyers and officials debunking Trump\u2019s lies about massive fraud in the 2020 election. He also publicly endorsed President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the Supreme Court. Barbara Jones, a former federal prosecutor and a retired judge who has been a special master in several recent high-profile investigations. She was special master to examine materials seized during an FBI raid of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s home and office in April 2021. She was also a special master in the Michael Cohen case, to make sure investigators didn\u2019t sweep up any documents that were attorney-client privileged. Paul Huck Jr., who now has his own law firm, had been a partner at the Jones Day law firm, which represented the Trump campaign in 2016. DOJ and Trump each propose 2 special masters for Mar-a-Lago probe Huck also previously served as the deputy attorney general for Florida and as general counsel to former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist \u2013 then a Republican and now the Democratic nominee for governor in Florida. There is one potential complication however: Chris Kise, Trump\u2019s current lawyer, also worked for Crist and overlapped with Huck. Raymond Dearie served as a federal judge in New York since 1986. He retired in 2011 and is now a senior judge on the circuit. Dearie also served a seven-year term on the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA court. He was one of the judges who approved an FBI and DOJ request to surveil Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, as part of the federal inquiry into whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election. There are a lot of documents from Mar-a-Lago to review, and Trump\u2019s team isn\u2019t in a hurry. They proposed the special master get 90 days to complete his or her work. The Justice Department wants to move more quickly, proposing the review be finished by October 17. Historically, Trump has not hesitated to exhaust his legal options, and we could end up seeing appeals up to the Supreme Court. Already, the Justice Department has appealed Cannon\u2019s original ruling requiring the special master. Someone has to pay for the special master\u2019s time and resources, and nobody\u2019s offering to pick up the full check. The Justice Department lawyers told Cannon that they think Trump should pay for the whole thing because he\u2019s the one who is \u201crequesting the special master.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers propose that the costs incurred by the Mar-a-Lago special master should be \u201csplit evenly\u201d between him and the US government. Trump\u2019s team said that the Justice Department \u201cwrongly assumes\u201d that documents are classified forever if they have classification markings. More than 100 documents with classification markings were seized from Mar-a-Lago during the FBI\u2019s search in early August. \u201cTheir stance wrongly assumes that if a document has a classification marking, it remains classified in perpetuity,\u201d the filing says, explaining Trump\u2019s position on the matter. Their comment raises the specter that some of the materials seized from Mar-a-Lago might have been declassified, even though the documents have classification markings on them. Trump and his allies have publicly claimed that he issued a blanket order declassifying many of the materials in question. CNN has previously reported that 18 ex-Trump officials believe the claim is false, and Trump\u2019s lawyers haven\u2019t made this assertion in court, where there are legal consequences for lying. Cannon has some tough decisions to make, with the whole country watching. In her original ruling on Labor Day, she indicated she would act quickly, but there\u2019s no official deadline at the moment. Meanwhile, the Justice Department is appealing her original ruling to the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals. At the same time, DOJ asked Cannon to revisit her ruling and let it continue to look at the seized documents for both criminal investigation and intelligence review purposes. Cannon has asked for Trump to respond by Monday at 10 a.m. ET. CNN\u2019s Hannah Rabinowitz, Laura Smitherman, Kara Scannell, Evan Perez and Shawna Mizelle contributed to this report.",

Friday night\u2019s joint court filing also stressed the wide gap between the DOJ and Trump, as the two sides disagreed over how long the special master investigation would last, what he or she would consider, and who foots the bill. It\u2019s the latest legal turn in the Justice Department\u2019s historic criminal investigation into Trump\u2019s potential mishandling of documents as his term ended in January 2021. The FBI executed a search warrant last month at the former president\u2019s Florida home and resort, seizing 11,000 documents, including more than 100 classified government records. READ: DOJ and Trump team proposals for special master review US District Judge Aileen Cannon earlier this week granted Trump\u2019s request for a special master \u2013 a third-party attorney outside of the government \u2013 and ordered criminal investigators at the Justice Department to stop using the seized materials as part of their ongoing probe until the special master finishes their review. It will be up to Cannon to sort out the differences. The Justice Department wants the special master to move relatively quickly, wrapping up its review in five weeks, by October 17. Trump proposed 90 days. The Justice Department also argued that the special master shouldn\u2019t touch any documents with classification markings and that the review shouldn\u2019t include any executive privilege considerations. Trump\u2019s lawyers, meanwhile, want the special master to review \u201call seized materials,\u201d including classified records. Whomever ends up getting appointed to fill the role will immediately be catapulted into the center of one of the most consequential criminal investigations in modern American history. The Justice Department nominated two retired federal judges \u2013 Thomas Griffith and Barbara Jones \u2013 to serve as special master. Griffith, a Bush appointee, served on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals from 2005 to 2020. In one of his final major rulings before retiring, he wrote the majority opinion rejecting House Democrats\u2019 attempt to subpoena Trump\u2019s former White House Counsel Don McGahn. (The decision was later overturned.) Griffith later co-authored a report alongside other prominent conservative lawyers and officials debunking Trump\u2019s lies about massive fraud in the 2020 election. And he publicly endorsed President Joe Biden\u2019s nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge throws out Trump's sprawling lawsuit against Hillary Clinton, ex-FBI officials over Russia probe Jones, a Bill Clinton appointee to the federal bench, is a former federal prosecutor and a retired judge from the Southern District of New York from 1995 to 2012. She was tapped to serve as a special master to examine materials seized during an FBI raid of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s home and office in April 2021. She was also a special master in the Michael Cohen case, to make sure investigators didn\u2019t sweep up any documents that were attorney-client privileged. Both Giuliani and Cohen were Trump\u2019s lawyers while they were investigated by the Justice Department. Trump\u2019s legal team nominated lawyer Paul Huck Jr. and Judge Raymond Dearie to serve as special master. Huck, who has his own law firm, had been a partner at the Jones Day law firm, which represented the Trump campaign in 2016, and a contributor to the conservative legal organization the Federalist Society. DOJ and Trump each propose 2 special masters for Mar-a-Lago probe He previously served as the deputy attorney general for Florida and as general counsel to former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist \u2013 who was a Republican at the time and now a Democratic nominee for governor in Florida. Chris Kise, Trump\u2019s current lawyer, also worked for Crist and overlapped with Huck. They worked together at the Florida attorney general\u2019s office. Huck\u2019s wife, Barbara Lagoa, was on Trump\u2019s short list as a Supreme Court nominee after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in 2020. Dearie has served as a federal judge in New York since 1986, when he was nominated by former President Ronald Reagan. He retired in 2011 and is now a senior judge on the circuit. Dearie also served a seven-year term on the US Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, or FISA court. He was one of the judges who approved an FBI and DOJ request to surveil Carter Page, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, as part of the federal inquiry into whether Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Cannon, the Trump-appointed judge presiding over the case, has said she\u2019ll decide \u201cexact details and mechanics\u201d of the special master process \u201cexpeditiously\u201d after both sides submit their proposals. It\u2019s not clear if she\u2019ll hold a hearing on the matter or if she\u2019ll simply issue a written order with her decision. Takeaways from the Trump and DOJ Mar-a-Lago special master court filing The two sides haven\u2019t agreed on much throughout the litigation, and it\u2019s no surprise that their proposals submitted Friday spell out vastly different visions of how the special master should conduct their review. For instance, both sides also disagree over who should pay for the special master. Trump\u2019s lawyers proposed that the costs incurred by the special master should be \u201csplit evenly\u201d between him and the US government. The Justice Department told the judge that they think Trump should pay for the whole thing, because he\u2019s the one who is \u201crequesting the special master.\u201d Separately, prosecutors are appealing Cannon\u2019s ruling to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, and also on Thursday asked Cannon to issue an emergency order temporarily allowing investigators to use the seized materials while the appeal plays out. The Justice Department also says that it must be allowed to continue to access the classified documents as the intelligence community reviews the materials for national security reasons, arguing that the intelligence review cannot be easily separated from the criminal investigation. Top federal prosecutors have said the intelligence review has been temporary halted due to Cannon\u2019s ruling, undermining national security. Timeline: The Justice Department criminal inquiry into Trump taking classified documents to Mar-a-Lago The unprecedented search took place after a different federal judge authorized the warrant, finding there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d of several crimes, including violations of the Espionage Act and possible obstruction of justice. FBI agents recovered more than 100 classified documents during the search, including 18 marked \u201ctop secret,\u201d which is the highest level of classification. The investigation revolves around the possible mishandling of classified government documents. The US government has recovered at least 325 classified documents from Mar-a-Lago this year, through Trump\u2019s voluntarily turnover of documents in January, a grand jury subpoena in June, and the FBI search last month. Trump has denied all wrongdoing. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "Ex-Attorney General William Barr\u2019s scathing critique of a major court victory for Donald Trump in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents drama is escalating the scrutiny of the judge who put the brakes on the investigation. Barr was once seen as a facilitator of the then-President\u2019s penchant for tearing at the limits of presidential power. But since Trump\u2019s refusal to accept his defeat to President Joe Biden in 2020, Barr has emerged as one of his most acerbic and significant critics. He, for instance, infuriated Trump by publicly declaring there was no significant electoral fraud. And his video testimony has emerged as one of the key weapons in the televised hearings run by the House select committee investigating the US Capitol insurrection. On Tuesday, Barr took aim at a decision by Trump-appointed Judge Aileen Cannon to grant Trump\u2019s request for a \u201cspecial master\u201d to vet for executive and legal privilege issues the material taken from his home in last month\u2019s FBI search. \u201cThe opinion, I think, was wrong, and I think the government should appeal it. It\u2019s deeply flawed in a number of ways,\u201d Barr said on Fox on Tuesday. It was the second time in just a few days that the former attorney general had taken to the network favored by conservatives to hammer Trump on the controversy. And his statements are adding to the swirl of outside interest in the next critical stages of this high-stakes legal process \u2013 the search for a third-party official to serve as a \u201cspecial master\u201d and the Justice Department\u2019s decision on whether to appeal Cannon\u2019s ruling, which would come at the risk of further delays for the probe. Barr\u2019s outspokenness will have three main consequences. First, such comments by a longtime political and legal conservative will add credibility to growing questions not just about Cannon\u2019s legal reasoning but also whether Monday\u2019s ruling, which delivered several big wins to Trump, was motivated by loyalty to the president who appointed her. Second, his comments will renew intrigue over his personal transformation \u2013 from the attorney general who shielded Trump from the full blast of the Mueller report into his 2016 campaign\u2019s links with Russia into one of the ex-President\u2019s most fervent critics. Whether Barr is being driven by an effort to rehabilitate his reputation as a legal straight shooter, a desire to defend the Justice Department against Trump\u2019s attacks or, is simply right on the facts, is open for debate. Third, Barr\u2019s latest criticism of his former boss \u2013 including that he was wrong to have classified information at Mar-a-Lago \u2013 will likely earn him a fresh broadside from the ex-President and his acolytes. Not that Barr cares, since he chuckled when he told Fox that Trump\u2019s definition of a RINO (Republican in name only) is anyone who doesn\u2019t believe the election was stolen. Barr\u2019s criticism added to that of many legal experts over the quality and potential consequences of Cannon\u2019s legal opinion. After last week calling Trump\u2019s demand for a \u201cspecial master\u201d a \u201cred herring,\u201d Barr on Tuesday argued that the fundamentals of the case against Trump and those around him in Florida were already set. \u201cThe government has very strong evidence of what it really needs to determine whether charges are appropriate \u2013 which is government documents were taken, classified information was taken and not handled appropriately,\u201d Barr told Fox. Takeaways from the ruling granting Trump's request for a special master in Mar-a-Lago probe \u201cAnd there\u2019s some evidence to suggest that they were deceived and none of that really relates to the content of documents. It relates to the fact that there were documents there, and the fact that they were classified and the fact that they were subpoenaed and never delivered.\u201d After Barr spoke, The Washington Post reported Tuesday evening that information about a foreign government\u2019s nuclear capabilities was among the documents found by the FBI at Mar-a-Lago, citing people familiar with the matter. The granting of the request for a special master \u2013 a step the DOJ vehemently opposed \u2013 is a significant complication for prosecutors since it means they will be prevented from reviewing material taken from Trump\u2019s residence for now. An investigation into the potential damage to national security wrought by Trump\u2019s careless handling of the material was allowed to continue. The comparatively mundane task of finding an official to fulfill the role will be difficult since filings in the case and Trump\u2019s characteristically emotional response to its intricacies suggest agreement between the parties could be close to impossible. Then, given the highly classified nature of some of the material, the person concerned will need to have top security clearances, further narrowing the pool of possible candidates. And the official must be willing to brave the stream of invective that could be flung their way by the former President, who, in an inflammatory campaign trail appearance on Saturday night, branded FBI agents as \u201cvicious monsters.\u201d The special master\u2019s role will also be complicated by the vague mandate he or she has so far been given by Cannon. Questions of executive privilege \u2013 a president\u2019s right to receive private information and advice from officials \u2013 has been sparsely litigated, especially in the case of former commanders in chief. On the face of it, a former president has no established right to make such claims, especially for classified material that did not originate in the White House. But this is an issue that Trump might himself try to challenge in court as part of his frequent strategy of trying to delay accountability. Analysis: Here's *exactly* why Donald Trump will likely run again The same issue weighs on the DOJ\u2019s dilemma over whether to appeal Cannon\u2019s ruling. Many legal scholars have noted that her reasoning that Trump, as an ex-president, is at greater risk of reputational harm than regular Americans appeared to create a whole new category of citizenship under the law. It also provided a potential opening for defense lawyers in any unrelated case to argue that defendants should therefore have the right to a special master \u2013 a situation that could considerably clog up the criminal justice system. For that reason, it might be incumbent on the DOJ to appeal, even though such a move could condemn the Mar-a-Lago case to a long sequence of court challenges that could take months and further delay the investigation. Ryan Goodman, a professor at NYU Law, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Tuesday evening that the department should make an urgent appeal to at least release the injunction on its use of material taken from Trump\u2019s home. But Goodman, like Barr, acknowledged the danger that mounting legal challenges could end up in prolonged litigation. That would suit Trump fine since it would push the case deeper into a 2024 campaign in which he\u2019s likely to be a candidate, which would further enable his effort to condemn the investigation as politically motivated. The increasing scrutiny of Cannon\u2019s actions means she will be the latest judge to be drawn into a vortex of political second guessing in the Trump era of American politics. The way that Cannon has acted has fueled debate over her motivation. After the Trump team filed a threadbare legal document requesting a special master, for example, the judge gave them time to refine their arguments. At times, her Monday opinion seemed to mirror the conservative criticism of the DOJ \u2013 including on the issue of whether Trump had suffered reputational damage from the search. She wrote that there was a need to ensure \u201cthe integrity of an orderly process amidst swirling allegations of bias and media leaks.\u201d The most unhinged accusations of bias in this case came from Trump. At the same time, however, the idea that is circulating on the left that Cannon is nothing but a hack and had to be acting to safeguard Trump\u2019s political interest because she was appointed by him points to a slippery slope. Given that most judges are appointed by presidents, they are all liable to similar charges. If the politicization of the judiciary system continues, it would make it all but impossible in these circumstances for any politician to face true justice for perceived lawlessness. Of course, this politicization of the legal system has been perpetuated by Trump. Chief Justice John Roberts once issued an extraordinary statement reminding Trump while he was president that there were no Trump judges or Obama judges or Bush judges or Clinton judges but that there was instead an independent judiciary. The statement, released in 2018, followed one of the then-President\u2019s frequent claims that a judge appointed by his predecessor was biased against him. So, if Cannon is being unfairly maligned for supposed political bias, she is the victim of a trend that originated with the president who appointed her.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge has granted former President Donald Trump\u2019s request to appoint a \u201cspecial master\u201d to review materials that the FBI seized from Mar-a-Lago last month. The decision, from Trump-appointed District Judge Aileen Cannon, is a significant victory for the former President, who has railed against the Biden administration and Justice Department since the search was executed four weeks ago. READ: Judge's ruling on special master for Mar-a-Lago documents \u201cAs a function of Plaintiff\u2019s former position as President of the United States, the stigma associated with the subject seizure is in a league of its own,\u201d Cannon wrote. \u201cA future indictment, based to any degree on property that ought to be returned, would result in reputational harm of a decidedly different order of magnitude.\u201d Cannon ordered that a third-party attorney, from outside the government, be brought in to review the materials that were taken from Trump\u2019s home and resort in Florida. The order also halts the Justice Department from continuing its review of the materials seized from Mar-a-Lago \u201cpending completion of the special master\u2019s review or further Court order.\u201d The classification review and intelligence assessments being conducted by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, however, will be allowed to continue. Both sides have until Friday to nominate special master candidates and their specific duties. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that a special master was needed because they don\u2019t trust the Justice Department to fairly identify privileged materials that would need to be excluded from the ongoing criminal probe. Trump blasted the Justice Department and the seizure at his rally in Pennsylvania this weekend. \u201cThis egregious abuse of the law is going to produce a backlash the likes of which nobody has ever seen before,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 these same exact people at Justice and the FBI, these same exact people, along with outside scum, are at it again with the horrific raid of my home. They just go on and on and they have to be stopped.\u201d However, Cannon wrote that Trump had not proven that his constitutional rights were disregarded. \u201c(T)he Court agrees with the Government that, at least based on the record to date, there has not been a compelling showing of callous disregard for Plaintiff\u2019s constitutional rights,\u201d she wrote. But Cannon cited several reasons for bringing in the special master, among them \u201cthe interest in ensuring the integrity of an orderly process amidst swirling allegations of bias and media leaks.\u201d She also cited the historic nature of the case. The judge said the special master will be tasked with reviewing \u201cseized property for personal items and documents and potentially privileged material subject to claims of attorney-client and/or executive privilege.\u201d She added: \u201cThe Court is mindful that restraints on criminal prosecutions are disfavored but finds that these unprecedented circumstances call for a brief pause to allow for neutral, third-party review to ensure a just process with adequate safeguards.\u201d The Justice Department has said that its own \u201cfilter team\u201d already finished its review of the Mar-a-Lago documents \u2013 and found a small set of attorney-client privileged records. In court documents, DOJ said a \u201climited\u201d number of records potentially covering attorney-client privilege were filtered out, and that the department was following the procedures it laid out to a magistrate judge when it sought the warrant, but Cannon had questions about its results. The Justice Department also obtained \u201ccorrespondent related to taxes,\u201d and medical documents during the search, according to the privilege team report that remains sealed but Cannon described Monday. Cannon noted that Justice Department lawyers had acknowledged it seized some \u201c[p]ersonal effects without evidentiary value,\u201d as well as 500 pages of material potentially subject to attorney-client privilege. \u201cTo appoint a special master to make privilege determinations while simultaneously allowing the Government, in the interim, to continue using potentially privileged material for investigative purposes would be to ignore the pressing concerns and hope for the best,\u201d the judge said. Revelatory moments from the 90-minute Mar-a-Lago special master hearing She wrote that Trump\u2019s \u201cindividual interest in and need for the seized property\u201d was one reason to rule in favor of Trump\u2019s requests for a special master. Cannon also said that the privilege review team\u2019s report outlined \u201cat least two instances in which members of the Investigative Team were exposed to material that was then delivered to the Privilege Review Team.\u201d \u201cThose instances alone, even if entirely inadvertent, yield questions about the adequacy of the filter,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe United States is examining the opinion and will consider appropriate next steps in the ongoing litigation,\u201d said Justice Department spokesman Anthony Coley. Cannon set a Friday deadline for Trump\u2019s lawyers and Justice Department prosecutors to negotiate the special master\u2019s \u201cduties and limitations\u201d and to submit a list of potential candidates to serve in the role. She also wants both sides to propose a schedule for the special master\u2019s review and to spell out how the person will be compensated for their work. William Barr, on Fox, says there's no legitimate reason for classified docs to be at Mar-a-Lago and doubts Trump declassified \u201cThe exact details and mechanics of this review process will be decided expeditiously following receipt of the parties\u2019 proposals,\u201d Cannon wrote. Because the lawsuit demanding the special master was filed by Trump two weeks after the search, it has raised questions among legal observers what role a special master could even play, given that by that time the Justice Department was likely well on its way to finishing its review of the evidence. The scope of a special mater will be key. The DOJ had asked for the review, if it was granted, to focus on materials potentially covered by attorney-client privilege. Trump has been asking for the special master on the basis of there being executive privilege concerns with the seizure of the records. At the hearing, according to reports, the judge said that Trump\u2019s ability to assert executive privilege as a former president was unsettled law. But she also had pointed questions for the Trump team about what the review they were seeking would look like. If the two sides don\u2019t agree on the parameters for the soon-to-be appointed special master, they should explain their differences in a court filing, Cannon ruled Monday. Explaining why she was ordering a special master review for material potentially covered by executive privilege, Cannon said that the Justice Department had not convinced the court that those concerns should be \u201cdisregarded,\u201d as she went on quote from how the Supreme Court described its move in a dispute this year over Trump January 6 documents, including a statement from Justice Brett Kavanaugh. The DOJ had \u201carguably overstate[d] the law,\u201d Cannon wrote, when asserting that executive privilege had no \u201crole to play here because Plaintiff \u2013 a former head of the Executive Branch \u2013 is entirely foreclosed from successfully asserting executive privilege against the current Executive Branch.\u201d \u201cThe Supreme Court did not rule out the possibility of a former President overcoming an incumbent President on executive privilege matters,\u201d Cannon wrote. She quoted from both the 1977 decision Nixon v. Administrator of General Services and from the order released this year by the Supreme Court when it refused to block the Archives\u2019 release to House January 6 investigators Trump White House documents. \u201cFurther, just this year, the Supreme Court noted that, at least in connection with a congressional investigation, \u2018[t]he questions whether and in what circumstances a former President may obtain a court order preventing disclosure of privileged records from his tenure in office, in the face of a determination by the incumbent President to waive the privilege, are unprecedented and raise serious and substantial concerns,\u2019\u201d Cannon wrote, quoting from the Supreme Court order. Cannon added a line from a statement Kavanaugh wrote with that Supreme Court order: \u201cA former President must be able to successfully invoke the Presidential communications privilege for communications that occurred during his Presidency, even if the current President does not support the privilege claim. Concluding otherwise would eviscerate the executive privilege for Presidential communications.\u201d Jumping off of those quotes from the Supreme Court, Cannon wrote Monday that \u201ceven if any assertion of executive privilege by Plaintiff ultimately fails in this context, that possibility, even if likely, does not negate a former President\u2019s ability to raise the privilege as an initial matter.\u201d Cannon of the Southern District of Florida, was nominated by Trump to the bench in May 2020 and confirmed by the Senate in a 56-21 just days after the presidential election in November 2020. She previously served as an assistant US attorney in Florida in the Major Crimes Division and as an appellate attorney, according to written answers she gave to the Senate during her confirmation process. A University of Michigan Law School graduate, Cannon clerked for a federal judge and later practiced law at a firm in Washington, DC, where she handled a range of cases, including some related to \u201cgovernment investigations,\u201d she told the Senate. At her 2020 nomination hearing, Cannon thanked members of her family and shared the impact of their experience on her own life. \u201cTo my loving mother \u2026 who, at the age of 7, had to flee the repressive Castro regime in search of freedom and security, thank you for teaching me about the blessing that is this country and the importance of securing the rule of law for generations to come,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "A Democratic member of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol said Sunday that he expects the panel\u2019s final report to come out \u201cby the end of the year.\u201d \u201cWell, certainly by the end of the year, because we\u2019re like Cinderella at midnight,\u201d Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin told \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS. \u201cOur license runs out at the end of the year, but under House Resolution 503, that\u2019s a significant part of our responsibility, to report to the American people about how to prevent coups, insurrections, political violence and attacks on our democratic process going forward.\u201d CNN reported in July that sources have said the bipartisan committee has already started writing its report, but there is still much debate over which direction it should go. A key question the panel will have to answer is whether the report should include a criminal referral of former President Donald Trump. Most select committee members feel that the public hearings held earlier this year have clearly laid out that Trump committed a crime for his role leading up to and on January 6 but believe it is up to the Department of Justice to pursue further. January 6 committee seeking voluntary cooperation from Newt Gingrich As the committee prepares for the end-of-year sprint, Raskin said Sunday that he hopes its members are able to hear testimony from several key people, including former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, the wife of Justice Clarence Thomas. \u201cI would say (Thomas) has a relevant testimony to render, and she should come forward and give it. I don\u2019t want to overstate her role,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to more than 1,000 people, but we\u2019d like to hear from Gingrich and we\u2019d like to hear from her, too.\u201d The committee wants to learn more about communications Gingrich had with senior advisers in the Trump White House about television advertisements that relied on false claims about the election. And January 6 panelists have also been pushing for testimony from Thomas, whose support of the efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s 2020 electoral defeat have come under scrutiny given her husband\u2019s participation in a case that was before the US Supreme Court concerning the select committee investigation. One of her lawyers said in a June letter to the panel that he \u201cdoes not believe there is currently a sufficient basis to speak with\u201d the conservative activist. Meanwhile, Raskin said he hopes the committee receives voluntary testimony from former Vice President Mike Pence, whose potential cooperation with the lawmakers would make him the investigation\u2019s most high-profile witness and could further expose Trump\u2019s scheme to overturn his 2020 election loss. \u201cI think he has a lot of relevant evidence, and I would hope he would come forward and testify about what happened,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to get everybody to come forward voluntarily. \u2026 I would assume he\u2019s going to come forward and testify voluntarily.\u201d Pence said last month that he would give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to any formal invitation to testify before the committee, while hinting at potential executive privilege issues. Asked if his comments Sunday about Pence were intended to suggest the January 6 committee has made progress in trying to secure the former vice president\u2019s testimony, Raskin told CNN that he just assumes \u201ceveryone will testify voluntarily, especially if they have nothing to hide.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction.

Former NYPD officer sentenced to 10 years in prison for assaulting a police officer on January 6 Cipollone and Philbin previously testified to the House select committee investigating January 6, where they declined to some questions because of executive privilege. The discussions with the Justice Department were intended to reach an arrangement between the two sides over possible executive privilege issues.

            "article_content": "US government documents were \u201clikely concealed and removed\u201d from a storage room at Mar-a-Lago as part of an effort to \u201cobstruct\u201d the FBI\u2019s investigation into former President Donald Trump\u2019s potential mishandling of classified materials, the Justice Department said in a blockbuster court filing Tuesday night. More than 320 classified documents have now been recovered from Mar-a-Lago, the Justice Department said, including more than 100 in the FBI search earlier this month. Tuesday\u2019s filing represents the Justice Department\u2019s strongest case to date that Trump concealed classified material he was keeping at Mar-a-Lago in an attempt to obstruct the FBI\u2019s investigation into the potential mishandling of classified material. Dissecting 7 key pieces of the Mar-a-Lago photo The Justice Department revealed the startling new details as part of its move to oppose Trump\u2019s effort to intervene in the federal investigation that led to the search of his Florida resort and his desire for a \u201cspecial master\u201d to be appointed to the case. Trump has pushed an \u201cincomplete and inaccurate narrative\u201d in his recent court filings about the Mar-a-Lago search, the Justice Department said. \u201cThe government provides below a detailed recitation of the relevant facts, many of which are provided to correct the incomplete and inaccurate narrative set forth in Plaintiff\u2019s filings,\u201d prosecutors wrote. It presents a strong rebuttal of the criticisms of the FBI\u2019s unprecedented search of a former President\u2019s residence, laying out clearly how Trump had failed to return dozens of classified documents even after his lawyer attested that he had provided all classified material in his possession. A picture on the final page of the filing showing classified documents arrayed on the floor of Trump\u2019s office \u2013 full of highly classified markings like \u201cHCS,\u201d meaning human intelligence sources \u2013 hammered home how sensitive the material Trump had taken was. At issue is Trump\u2019s compliance with a grand jury subpoena, issued in May, demanding that he turn over classified documents from Mar-a-Lago. Prosecutors said Tuesday that some documents were likely removed from a storage room before Trump\u2019s lawyers examined the area, while they were trying to comply with the subpoena. The timeline is essential, because Trump\u2019s lawyers later told investigators that they searched the storage area and that all classified documents were accounted for. \u201cThe government also developed evidence that government records were likely concealed and removed from the Storage Room and that efforts were likely taken to obstruct the government\u2019s investigation,\u201d prosecutors wrote. \u201cThis included evidence indicating that boxes formerly in the Storage Room were not returned prior to counsel\u2019s review.\u201d The allegations came after the DOJ\u2019s filing went into specific detail about actions from Trump\u2019s team that the department implies were obstructive to its probe. In the filing opposing Trump\u2019s request, DOJ argues that the former president lacks standing over presidential records \u201cbecause those records do not belong to him,\u201d as presidential records are considered property of the government. The Presidential Records Act makes clear that \u201c[t]he United States\u201d has \u201ccomplete ownership, possession, and control of them,\u201d the DOJ filing states. Intel agencies have been working with the FBI for months on assessing Mar-a-Lago documents Trump has argued that his constitutional rights have been violated and that some of the documents seized earlier this month contain material covered by privilege \u2013 particularly executive privilege. The Justice Department was ordered to submit the filing by Judge Aileen Cannon, who has already indicated she is inclined to grant Trump\u2019s request for third party oversight of documents the FBI seized Mar-a-Lago. The role of a special master is to filter out any materials seized in a search that don\u2019t belong in the hands of investigators because of a privilege. Special masters have been used in high-profile cases before, but usually in cases where the FBI has searched an attorney\u2019s office or home and there is a need to filter out materials concerning attorney-client privilege. Trump\u2019s request has centered on the need to protect documents concerning executive privilege from his conduct as president. Signals from Cannon, a Trump appointee, that she is leaning toward appointing a special master in the Mar-a-Lago search have raised eyebrows among legal observers. For one, Trump filed his request for the appointment two weeks after the search of his Florida home, risking the potential that the Justice Department is already done with the bulk of its review. Secondly, Trump and the judge alike have pointed to civil rules concerning special master appointments, when the search warrant is arising in a criminal context. Since the August 8 search, a number of previously secret court filings the DOJ submitted to obtain the warrant have been made partially public in part because of a bid for transparency filed in court by several media organizations, including CNN. An 'annoyed' Melania Trump stays mum on Mar-a-Lago search as she promotes NFT business Those redacted documents have revealed that the search was connected to a DOJ investigation into alleged violations of the Espionage Act, criminal mishandling of government documents and obstruction of justice. According to an FBI affidavit that was released last week, an FBI review of 15 boxes retrieved by the National Archives from Mar-a-Lago in January found 184 documents bearing classification markings \u2013 some of them identified as particularly sensitive government documents. Trump, in seeking the special master, has stressed in court filings the lack of criminal enforcement in the Presidential Records Act, a Watergate-era law laying out the process for preserving presidential records. He did not mention the three criminal statutes the DOJ cited in its warrant documents. Trump\u2019s lawyers have also emphasized his supposedly unfettered ability when he was president to declassify documents, though the statutes in question don\u2019t require that the materials be classified. Wednesday morning, Trump posted on his social media platform on Truth Social for the first time since the Justice Department filing and once again claimed to have declassified documents that were found at his Mar-a-Lago residence. In one of his most recent posts, Trump appeared to comment on the photo of top-secret documents laid out on the floor, saying, \u201cTerrible the way the FBI\u2026 threw documents haphazardly all over the floor,\u201d and, \u201cLucky I Declassified!\u201d In other posts, he attacked the FBI and DOJ generally and said, \u201cThis is the time, after many years of lawbreaking & unfairness, to clean things up. All things for a reason. DRAIN THE SWAMP!!!\u201d He repeated his false claims of a stolen election and said, \u201cOur Country is going to hell!\u201d He also claimed crowds are \u201calready forming\u201d for his rally on Saturday. A top Justice Department official contends that federal investigators were limited in what they could look through when visiting the resort in June \u2013 contrary to the Trump team\u2019s narrative of total cooperation. Trump\u2019s lawyer requested that the FBI come to the resort to pick up the documents after the Trump team had received a grand jury subpoena in May seeking any materials marked classified, according to the Justice Department. DOJ\u2019s account also undermined claims by Trump and his allies that the former President had declassified the materials in question. Garland places new restrictions on political activities for Justice Department political appointees \u201cWhen producing the documents, neither counsel nor the custodian asserted that the former President had declassified the documents or asserted any claim of executive privilege,\u201d the filing said. \u201cInstead, counsel handled them in a manner that suggested counsel believed that the documents were classified: the production included a single Redweld envelope, double-wrapped in tape, containing the document.\u201d In the DOJ\u2019s account, Trump\u2019s lawyer said that all the remaining documents from Trump\u2019s White House were being kept in the storage at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cCounsel further represented that there were no other records stored in any private office space or other location at the Premises and that all available boxes were searched,\u201d the filing said. Prosecutors confirmed Trump\u2019s assertion that the visiting DOJ and FBI officials were then allowed to visit the storage area. \u201cCritically, however, the former President\u2019s counsel explicitly prohibited government personnel from opening or looking inside any of the boxes that remained in the storage room, giving no opportunity for the government to confirm that no documents with classification markings remained,\u201d the DOJ said. The Justice Department confirmed that grand jury subpoenas had been issued in its probe, and that the grand jury that issued them had been empaneled in DC. The department included a copy of a May 11 subpoena for government records at Mar-a-Lago marked as classified that indicated the existence of the DC federal grand jury. Before making the subpoena public, the department on Monday got permission to do so from Chief Judge Beryl Howell in the DC District Court, according to a footnote in its brief. The reference to Howell suggests that in addition to Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart and Cannon in Florida, a third judge is now involved in the DOJ\u2019s probe.

            "article_content": "The Justice Department has issued a new grand jury subpoena to the National Archives for more documents as part of its investigation into the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, two sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN. This latest subpoena, issued on August 17, is in addition to a subpoena the Department of Justice sent to the Archives earlier this year, requesting the same documents and information that the Archives had previously handed over to the House select committee investigating January 6. This new subpoena, which has not been previously reported, is understood to request additional documents and data from the Archives, pertaining to a period of time both before and after January 6. Thomas Windom, an assistant US Attorney, is leading the criminal probe into the effort to impede the transfer of power after the 2020 election, including the potential role played by former President Donald Trump and allies to organize a group of fake electors who could keep Trump in power despite losing the election. The US Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment. DOJ talks with Trump lawyers mark a grave moment for the ex-President The subpoena requests that the documents be produced by the end of August. The new subpoena is the latest indication that the Justice Department is ramping up its investigation and has broadened the scope of its probe into the potential role White House staff played in events leading up to the attack on the Capitol that day. Last week, CNN and others reported that Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, who pushed back on efforts by the former President and his allies to overturn the 2020 election, had been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury investigating the events surrounding January 6. Other Trump lawyers, including Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, have also been subpoenaed, and DOJ officials have been gearing up to try to access direct communications with Trump when he was in office, which could set off a legal fight over executive privilege.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s new lawsuit over the FBI search of his Florida resort codifies his political fury into a legal strategy and implicitly spells out how the ex-President intends to exploit the drama as a springboard for his likely 2024 White House bid. Trump\u2019s legal team on Monday asked a federal judge to appoint a \u201cspecial master\u201d to ensure the Justice Department returns any private documents taken from his residence, maintaining that his constitutional rights were violated. The request for a special master \u2013 an independent legal official \u2013 is not a surprising one, and may well be granted in such a case. It is a move that can be used to ensure that legally privileged or other similar documents collected by investigators are not drawn unnecessarily or unfairly into an ongoing case. Trump's legal team asks for 'special master' to go through Mar-a-Lago evidence and determine if some should be returned But in many other ways, Trump\u2019s filing \u2013 the most concrete and aggressive formal legal move in the case so far \u2013 is a classic of its genre. It fits squarely into the ex-President\u2019s history of using the legal system to delay, distract, distort and politicize accusations against him, a strategy that has often worked well to spare or postpone serious accountability. And it is also a characteristic example of how the former President often mixes and matches political and legal strategies when he comes under investigation. While the motion is a formal legal document, it serves as a political roadmap that explains how Trump would style himself as a presidential candidate persecuted, as he sees it, for partisan reasons by the Biden administration. It\u2019s also offers 27 pages of talking points for Trump\u2019s GOP allies and serves to take the focus away from the core questions in the case: did he illegally and recklessly keep classified information and government secrets to which he was not entitled and which could put national security as risk? And did Trump or those around him try to obstruct the investigators from continuing their pursuit? The gambit also once again underscores the extraordinarily sensitive stakes of the investigation and the political hornet\u2019s nest disturbed by the Justice Department in going ahead with the search of Trump\u2019s home. Such an operation at the home of any former president would be a deeply serious undertaking. The involvement of Trump \u2013 who\u2019s nursing a false grievance over his exit from power, who knows how to turn attempts to hold him to account into fundraising ammunition and who has incited violence \u2013 means the current case is one of the most serious in the DOJ\u2019s modern history. This reality appears to put even more of an onus on the department to explain and justify its actions and to provide the maximum amount of transparency possible to the public. But it also underscores yet another truism of Trump\u2019s career in politics \u2013 the simple act of investigating him inevitably exposes the institutions set up to constrain presidents and enforce the law to a backlash that leaves them politicized and often illegitimate in the eyes of his millions of supporters. Trump\u2019s loyalists have likewise tried to discredit probes of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. There were new signs on Monday that the DOJ\u2019s separate investigation into events surrounding that day are ramping up when CNN reported exclusively that the department issued a fresh subpoena to the National Archives \u2013 another development that could be troublesome for the former President and deepen his legal quagmire. Trump\u2019s move in the escalating showdown stirs the legal pot ahead of a Thursday deadline for the DOJ to provide the judge in the case with redactions in an underlying sealed affidavit that sets out detailed reasons for the search of Trump\u2019s residence two weeks ago and the material that FBI agents expected to find there. Judge Bruce Reinhart, meanwhile, wrote in an order on Monday that he was satisfied that the facts in the affidavit are \u201creliable\u201d and that while he understood calls for transparency, agreed that the Justice Department has genuine reasons, including the need to protect witnesses, for stopping the disclosure of information in the document. Exclusive: Justice Department issues new subpoena to National Archives for more January 6 documents The ostensible purpose of Trump\u2019s filing is to secure the appointment of a special master in the case. CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said that the request appeared on its face to be fair under the circumstances. \u201cI think Donald Trump has a fairly good chance of prevailing,\u201d Honig said on \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable request. It\u2019s actually not unprecedented.\u201d If material is discovered that is subject to attorney-client privilege or executive privilege, the special master could ensure that it is not passed on to prosecutors. Still, the move could also be seen as a way to delay the case against Trump, and to push it further into campaign season \u2013 ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections and the already stirring 2024 presidential race \u2013 and make it easier for the former President to cement the impression that he is being targeted for political reasons. On the other hand, the government has already had the documents for two weeks and the ex-President\u2019s legal team has not previously made such a request. Parts of the motion filed by Trump\u2019s team on Monday bore all the hallmarks of a document either prepared for, or with, the ex-President\u2019s predilections in mind. It was far more lively than a typically dry legal motion. It seemed at times an attempt to troll the legal system and even adopted a boastful tone in describing Mar-a-Lago, lauding it as a \u201chistoric landmark\u201d with 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms, on 17 acres and bearing a name that means \u201csea to lake.\u201d The filing opened with a statement that \u201cpolitics cannot be allowed to impact the administration of justice\u201d \u2013 a claim that came with considerable chutzpah since Trump was often accused in office of politicizing the Department of Justice. Donald Trump donors help underwrite portraits of him and Melania Trump at National Portrait Gallery It went on to state that \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump is the clear frontrunner in the 2024 Republican Presidential primary and in the 2024 General Election should he decide to run. Beyond that his endorsement in the 2022 mid-term primary elections has been decisive for Republican candidates.\u201d Trump\u2019s team then put his complaints about the search, previously delivered on social media, into a formal legal framework with the words: \u201cLaw enforcement is a shield that protects Americans. It cannot be used as a weapon for political purposes.\u201d There is a clear implication in the document that Trump, as a former president or as a potential 2024 presidential candidate, should not have been subjected to such a search. If this standard were adopted, it would offer potential impunity to anyone involved in politics. The Trump team\u2019s implicit argument is also consistent with the belief, which he showed throughout his presidency, that he had special status that made him immune from the widely understood constraints of the law. In legal terms, the search of his residence could be disastrous for the former President if it emerges that he broke laws, especially on the handling of the most sensitive national security material. It is not possible to know from the limited material available publicly how any case against him might turn out. But Trump has left little doubt that he sees the search as a massive political opportunity. And he\u2019s leveraged the moment to effectively force potential GOP presidential primary rivals to step in behind him and condemn it. As Trump has throughout his time in politics, the legal filing from his team appeared to take considerable liberties with the facts of the FBI search and the process that led up to it. It blamed the bureau\u2019s \u201cshockingly aggressive move\u201d that it said came with \u201cwith no understanding of the distress that it would cause most Americans.\u201d That half-line is characteristic Trumpian exaggeration. The document goes on to argue that the ex-President offered extraordinary and cordial cooperation with the National Archives and the FBI. But it also overlooks the fact that the search went ahead on the basis of a warrant approved by judge on the grounds that a probable crime had been committed. Trump looks to seize on feud with FBI as critical court hearing looms The arguments in the filing also seem to conflict with other publicly known aspects about the government\u2019s approach \u2013 including requests by the National Archives for the return of documents, the DOJ\u2019s involvement, a subpoena that was served on Trump for the material and the fact that agents still did not get what they wanted when they visited the former President at the property before they sought a search warrant. Not to mention that, according to CNN and New York Times reports, a lawyer for Trump told investigators in writing that no classified records were left at Mar-a-Lago after June. The FBI said in an inventory list at the end of its search that there were additional classified documents retrieved. The motion also contains yet another classic Trump flourish. It reveals that on August 11, 2022, counsel for Trump spoke with one of the lead officials in the case, Jay Bratt, the chief of the counterintelligence section in the DOJ\u2019s national security division. The message was intended for Attorney General Merrick Garland. \u201cPresident Trump wants the Attorney General to know that he has been hearing from people all over the country about the raid. If there was one word to describe their mood \u2014 it is \u2018angry.\u2019 The heat is building up. The pressure is building up. Whatever I can do to take the heat down, to bring the pressure down, just let us know.\u201d This statement is remarkable since it was Trump who announced the search of his resort. And he used his social media network to initiate a backlash among his followers and to deliver a political dividend. The message comes across as an implicit threat \u2013 about the consequences of investigating the former President \u2013 that is chilling in the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection. The approach also recalls previous Trump efforts to contact, and possibly influence, authorities who are investigating him. His attempt to co-opt former FBI Director James Comey during the Russia investigation, whom he later fired, comes to mind. Trump\u2019s new lawsuit could succeed in advancing some of his legal goals \u2013 such as they are. But it\u2019s a reminder of the legal and political ordeal that the country faces with an investigation into a combative and angry former president who is also showing every sign of weaponizing it to bolster his 2024 election bid.",

            "article_content": "Key members of the House committee probing the January 6, 2021, insurrection are dialing up pressure on former Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 whom pro-Donald Trump rioters demanded be hanged on that dark day \u2013 to testify to their committee. Pence would instantly become the investigation\u2019s most high-profile witness and could further expose the ex-President\u2019s scheme to steal the 2020 election and his negligence in failing to halt the mob once it had smashed its way into the US Capitol. The possibility of his testimony came into focus last week when he appeared to leave the door open to appearing. The former vice president also, however, staked out caveats involving executive privilege and the separation of powers that could form a rationale for him declining to show up. A source with knowledge of Pence\u2019s thinking told CNN last week that for those reasons it would be wrong to over-interpret the prospects of him testifying, adding that the former vice president also believes much of the information related to his experience that day has already been provided to the committee by two of his former top aides. Cheney says January 6 committee still wants to hear directly from Pence Pence has been hailed as a hero by some committee witnesses for refusing to play into the ex-President\u2019s demands to block the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. But his increasingly obvious 2024 presidential hopes suggest that an appearance before the committee in person or on video may represent too great a political risk. After all, the great lesson of this year\u2019s midterm election primary season is that candidates who challenge Trump over his post-election mayhem in 2020 usually lose, although one prominent exception has been in Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp, who had Pence\u2019s support, prevailed in his primary over a Trump-backed challenger. Still, committee member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, seized on the first portion of Pence\u2019s comments on testifying to put the onus back on the former vice president. \u201cI was encouraged to hear it. And I hope it meant what it sounded like it meant,\u201d Schiff told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cWe have been in discussion with the vice president\u2019s counsel for some time.\u201d Schiff added: \u201cI am confident that, if he is truly willing, that there is a way to work out any executive privilege or separation of powers issues.\u201d The committee\u2019s Republican vice chair, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, fresh from her loss to a Trump-backed primary challenger last week, also talked up the possibility of Pence potentially appearing before the panel. \u201cWhen the country has been through something as grave as this was, everyone who has information has an obligation to step forward. So I would hope that he will do that,\u201d Cheney told ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI would hope that he will understand how important it is for the American people to know every aspect of the truth about what happened that day.\u201d Mike Pence says he'd consider testifying before January 6 committee if invited There is no public indication that a formal invitation has been sent to Pence. But like Schiff, Cheney mentioned that the committee had been in contact with his attorneys. The Wyoming Republican appears to have had some success in pressuring an important witness to testify. She called publicly on former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to show up, and unlike some other senior Trump aides, he did not refuse a subpoena, eventually testifying behind closed doors. But Cipollone\u2019s future appears to lie in the law and not politics. Pence, by contrast, is in an increasingly dicey political spot \u2013 and there is no sign that he is willing to follow Cheney in risking his immediate political prospects to provide a full accounting of the Capitol insurrection. Pence spent the last few days in early-voting states New Hampshire and Iowa, seeking to open a lane for 2024 that might narrow considerably were he to repudiate Trump in televised testimony to the committee just as the former President\u2019s dominance over his party seems to be hardening. Throughout almost all of Trump\u2019s presidency, Pence was a loyal, admiring partner no matter what constitutional norm or behavioral barrier his boss shattered. But his political travel in recent days underscored his balancing act as he strives to save his political future. The former vice president has tried to claim credit for what conservatives see as the achievements of what he calls the Trump/Pence presidency, while distancing himself from the failed autocratic power grab with which it ended. He has separated himself from Trump by saying the party needs to look forwards and not backwards \u2013 a swipe at the ex-President\u2019s obsession with the 2020 election. And in recent days, Pence\u2019s delicate political positioning has led him to raise concern over the unprecedented search and removal of classified documents from the ex-President\u2019s home at Mar-a-Lago, but also to criticize subsequent GOP threats against the FBI. Cheney spotlights 'real work' ahead as January 6 investigation continues The House select committee is showing every sign it\u2019s having a busy August as it prepares to resume hearings in September to deepen its damning picture of Trump\u2019s conduct. With its recent moves, the committee appears to have been focusing on any discussions of whether Trump\u2019s Cabinet discussed invoking the 25th Amendment to remove then then-President \u2013 a step Pence ruled out. The committee also looks keen to flesh out second-hand witness accounts of Trump\u2019s behavior inside a presidential SUV after he supposedly demanded to be taken to the Capitol as his supporters marched on the citadel of US democracy on January 6, 2021. But securing Pence\u2019s testimony would arguably be the most significant victory for the committee so far, given his knowledge of inside efforts by Trump and those around him to sign onto an unconstitutional plan to keep Biden from power. Several of Pence\u2019s closest aides have provided testimony on video to the January 6 committee and two of them \u2013 his former chief of staff Marc Short and his ex-counsel Greg Jacob \u2013 have also appeared before a grand jury in connection with the Justice Department\u2019s separate investigation focusing on the insurrection. Pence was asked about his willingness to appear before the House committee in some form during a \u201cPolitics & Eggs\u201d breakfast last week in New Hampshire, a fabled stop on the campaign trail for potential presidential candidates in the first-in-the-nation primary state. \u201cIf there was an invitation to participate, I would consider it,\u201d Pence said in a remark that grabbed most of the attention. But he went on to sketch a possible way out for himself should he wish to avoid the politically perilous step of testifying to the committee about Trump\u2019s transgressions after the 2020 election. \u201cUnder the Constitution, we have three co-equal branches of government, and any invitation to be directed to me, I would have to reflect on the unique role I was serving in as vice president. It would be unprecedented in history for a vice president to be summoned to testify on Capitol Hill.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t actually be unprecedented for a vice president to testify to Congress. But Pence could try to argue to the committee that by making his former aides available he has ensured that his perspective, experiences and duty to history have been fulfilled without an in-person appearance. Schiff told CNN\u2019s Tapper that the former vice president could provide unique perspective on the events of one of the most violent days in modern American history. \u201cHe could plainly share a lot of very first-hand information about what it was like to be the subject of those efforts to get him to violate his constitutional duty and arrogate to himself the power to decide who won or who lost an American presidential election,\u201d the California Democrat said. Pence\u2019s testimony would help the committee go deeper into the nuts and bolts of the pressure from Trump and conservative lawyers for him to block certification of the election. The ex-President\u2019s own legal team and Pence concluded he had no power to do so. Short has already testified that the vice president repeatedly told Trump this was the case, bolstering one of the committee\u2019s core arguments \u2013 that Trump knew what he was asking Pence to do was illegal but pressed ahead with it anyway. \u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution,\u201d Trump tweeted as rioters breached the Capitol. There would be nothing as politically or legally explosive as hearing Pence\u2019s side of the story from his own lips, but that\u2019s one reason why it seems unlikely to happen.",

At a private event with staff the night before the election, Cheney specifically thanked people on her team for all they\u2019ve done to help her with the work of the committee and emphasized how important that work has been for the future of the country, a source familiar told CNN. Cheney had played a central role in ensuring the committee\u2019s summer hearings were focused on Donald Trump specifically, multiple sources told CNN, and her concession speech Tuesday reaffirmed her intent to be a fierce critic of the former President and his election lies while remaining undeterred by the political consequences. \u201cThis primary election is over,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cBut now the real work begins.\u201d Cheney spokesperson Jeremy Adler told CNN, \u201cPolitics won\u2019t play a role in the Committee\u2019s work.\u201d The committee now becomes Cheney\u2019s biggest platform for carrying out her message in her remaining days in Congress. She referenced the committee\u2019s hearings in her concession speech and how \u201cdozens of Republicans,\u201d including senior officials from Trump\u2019s White House, Justice Department and campaign have testified that they told the former President that the election was not stolen or rigged. \u201cThat\u2019s why President Trump and others invent excuses, pretexts for people not to watch the hearings at all,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cBut no citizen of this Republic is a bystander. All of us have an obligation to understand what actually happened.\u201d After Wyoming defeat, Cheney prepares for the longer-term fight against Trump -- and her own political future Cheney was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, of which, only two are still in the running to return to Congress next term. The others either lost their primary challenges or opted to retire. Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the other Republican on the January 6 committee, decided against running for reelection. Since its last hearing in July, the committee has continued to work behind closed doors, and plans to resume hearings in September. The committee is still gathering evidence and has reengaged in negotiations with some witnesses who had previously resisted sitting for a deposition, sources have told CNN. The committee could also be calling back witnesses it has interviewed previously, to corroborate new details, sources added. Former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he \u201cwould consider\u201d a formal invitation to testify before the committee, an invitation committee members have long been considering, but hinted at potential executive privilege issues. A person with knowledge of the former vice president\u2019s thinking, however, cautioned against reading too much into his remarks Wednesday and a spokesperson for the committee declined to comment on Pence\u2019s statement. And there is a question of how much committee members believe Pence\u2019s direct testimony is needed given Pence\u2019s chief of staff Marc Short and Pence aide Greg Jacob have already testified to the committee. The panel also has been zeroing in on former officials from Trump\u2019s Cabinet for testimony this month, having recently met with Trump\u2019s former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, revealing its particular interest in learning more about conversations among officials about possibly invoking the 25th Amendment after the US Capitol attack. At the same time, the panel is also working on the writing of its final report, which is expected to be released some time this fall. \u201cIn the course of these hearings, we have received new evidence and new witnesses have bravely stepped forward,\u201d Cheney said at the committee\u2019s latest hearing. \u201cEfforts to litigate and overcome immunity and executive-privilege claims have been successful, and those continue. Doors have opened, new subpoenas have been issued and the dam has begun to break.\u201d Timeline: Liz Cheney's political career, from Republican scion to champion of democracy The committee has conducted over a thousand interviews and depositions, received nearly 150,000 documents, and since the start of the hearings has received over 4,000 submissions to its tip line, a source tells CNN. But, many questions about the committee\u2019s investigation remain. Multiple investigations are underway into the missing Secret Service text messages from around January 6. Committee members feel they have just scratched the surface in terms of uncovering what\u2019s behind the missing text messages. The panel has subpoenaed records from the agency, and has received thousands of pages of documents, including radio traffic of then-Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s detail communicating about how to move him to a secure location on January 6, which was used in a hearing. But as of last week, the committee had only received one text message. And even though there appears to be a growing number of previously reluctant witnesses now willing to engage with the committee, there is still a considerable number of individuals refusing to cooperate, namely five House Republicans the committee subpoenaed, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday he would give \u201cdue consideration\u201d to any formal invitation to testify before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, while hinting at potential executive privilege issues. Pence made the remarks during a Q&A after a speech here at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics\u2019 \u201cPolitics & Eggs\u201d breakfast, a common stop for candidates considering a run for office. \u201cIf there was an invitation to participate, I would consider it,\u201d Pence said, after calling January 6 a tragic day for all Americans. \u201cBut, you heard me mention the Constitution a few times this morning. Under the Constitution, we have three co-equal branches of government, and any invitation to be directed to me, I would have to reflect on the unique role I was serving in as vice president. It would be unprecedented in history for a vice president to be summoned to testify on Capitol Hill. But, as I said, I don\u2019t want to pre-judge, so if there\u2019s ever any formal invitation rendered to us, we would give it due consideration.\u201d While Pence said it would be \u201cunprecedented\u201d for a vice president to be asked to testify on Capitol Hill, presidents and vice presidents have testified before Congress in the past. They include President Gerald Ford, who testified voluntarily in front of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal Justice in 1974 to explain why he pardoned his predecessor Richard Nixon. A person with knowledge of Pence\u2019s thinking cautioned against reading too much into his remarks Wednesday. The source noted that the former vice president would have serious constitutional issues about appearing before the January 6 panel, citing Pence\u2019s comments about the branches of government being co-equal. Pence also believes that much of the information related to his experience on January 6 has been provided to the committee, given that his former chief of staff, Marc Short, and Pence lawyer Greg Jacob have already testified in full, the source said. The January 6 committee had no comment. The select committee detailed at a public hearing in June how former President Donald Trump tried to pressure Pence, his vice president, to join in his scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election \u2013 and how Pence\u2019s refusal put his life in danger as rioters called for his hanging on January 6, 2021. 8 takeaways from the January 6 hearings day 3 Two witnesses who advised Pence that he did not have the authority to subvert the election testified during the June 16 hearing: Jacob and retired Republican judge J. Michael Luttig. The committee walked through how conservative Trump attorney John Eastman put forward a legal theory that Pence could unilaterally block certification of the election \u2013 a theory that was roundly rejected by Trump\u2019s White House attorneys and Pence\u2019s team but nevertheless was embraced by the former President. In a videotaped deposition, which was played on June 16, Short said the vice president advised Trump \u201cmany times\u201d that he didn\u2019t have the legal or constitutional authority to overturn the results while presiding over the joint session of Congress on January 6 to count the electoral votes. On Wednesday, Pence also reiterated his call for US Attorney General Merrick Garland to give the American people a full accounting of the reasons the recent search of Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort was necessary, citing the politicization of the FBI during the Trump administration. \u201cThis unprecedented action does demand unprecedented transparency,\u201d Pence said, while going on to defend the rank-and-file agents. \u201cI just want to remind my fellow Republicans, we can hold the AG accountable for the decision he made without attacking rank-and-file law enforcement personnel at the FBI. The Republican Party is the party of law and order. Our party stands with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line at the federal and state and local level, and these attacks on the FBI must stop. Calls to defund the FBI are just as wrong as calls to defund the police.\u201d Pence signals a 2024 bid as he meets with lawmakers and delivers South Carolina speech Pence spoke before a packed room, with about a dozen people standing along the walls. As he has done in recent speeches, he argued that elections are about the future and not the past and that the GOP must offer a positive vision for the future in order to win. This was the latest of several trips Pence has made to states with early presidential nominating contests; New Hampshire holds the first-in-the-nation presidential primary, a key contest in the race for the White House. After the speech, he was set to spend the day campaigning with candidates for state Senate and participating in roundtables with business leaders and law enforcement officials before delivering a keynote address at a Tri-County GOP event.

            "article_content": "Trump White House lawyer Eric Herschmann, who pushed back on efforts by the former President and his allies to overturn the 2020 election, has been subpoenaed by a federal grand jury investigating the events surrounding January 6, 2021, a person familiar with the probe confirmed to CNN. The subpoena seeking documents and testimony from Herschmann follows similar subpoenas in the federal criminal probe to other top Trump administration lawyers, Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin, who worked in the White House counsel\u2019s office. Herschmann worked as adviser to former President Donald Trump and attended at heated meetings where he objected to dubious legal theories put forward by Trump elections attorney John Eastman. As part of the criminal probe, investigators recently searched Eastman\u2019s cell phone. Separately, Justice Department officials have been gearing up to try to access direct communications with Trump when he was in office. Herschmann\u2019s testimony also could be relevant to that executive privilege fight. Politico first reported the Herschmann subpoena. Herschmann \u2013 a lower-profile adviser who joined the White House at the end of the administration \u2013 became a memorable and important witness in this summer\u2019s public hearings for the January 6 investigation on Capitol Hill. The House select committee probing the Capitol Hill insurrection captured Herschmann detailing how he dressed down Eastman after January 6, 2021. \u201cI said to him, \u2018Are you out of your f\u2019ing mind?\u2019 Right? I said, \u2018I only want to hear two words coming out of your mouth from now on: \u2018orderly transition,\u2019\u201d Herschmann said as part of a taped deposition that was replayed during a hearing. \u201c\u2018Now I\u2019m going to give you the best free legal advice you\u2019re ever getting in your life: Get a great f\u2019ing criminal defense lawyer.

            "article_content": "A federal judge in Atlanta has denied GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s motion to quash a subpoena, ruling that he must testify before a Fulton County grand jury investigating former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. In her written decision on Monday, US District Judge Leigh Martin May sent the case to the Superior Court of Fulton County to hear further proceedings on the US Constitution\u2019s \u201cSpeech or Debate\u201d clause, the centerpiece that Graham\u2019s attorneys argued immunized the US senator from South Carolina from having to testify in this case. What's up with the investigations of and lawsuits against Donald Trump \u201cBecause the record must be more fully developed before the Court can address the applicability of the \u2018Speech or Debate\u2019 clause to specific questions or lines of inquiry, and because Senator Graham\u2019s only request in removing the subpoena to this Court was to quash the subpoena in its entirety, the Case is REMANDED to the Superior Court of Fulton County for further proceedings,\u201d May wrote in the ruling. The South Carolina Republican is scheduled to appear as a witness in Atlanta in front of the special grand jury on August 23. In her ruling, May wrote that there are \u201cconsiderable areas of inquiry\u201d that are not \u201clegislative in nature\u201d and said that the District Attorney\u2019s office has shown \u201cextraordinary circumstances and a special need for Senator Graham\u2019s testimony on issues relating to alleged attempts to influence or disrupt the lawful administration of Georgia\u2019s 2020 elections.\u201d Five other attorneys who worked with Trump and spoke with Georgia election officials in the aftermath of the 2020 election have also received subpoenas to testify before the special purpose grand jury, and at least three of the lawyers are trying to fight their subpoenas in state courts this week. Last Tuesday, a Superior Court of Fulton County Judge ordered Trump\u2019s former attorney Rudy Giuliani to appear in front of the special purpose grand jury this week, after he delayed his testimony with a note from a doctor saying he couldn\u2019t fly after procedures in early July for two coronary heart stents. Graham\u2019s attorneys argued that his calls to Georgia officials after the 2020 election were legislative activity that were directly related to his committee responsibilities as the then-chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe subpoena implicates Senator Graham\u2019s legislative acts and must therefore be quashed,\u201d Graham\u2019s team of lawyers argued in court filings. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be playing whack-a-mole with the District Attorney,\u201d Graham\u2019s attorney\u2019s Brian Lea argued in court last Wednesday, saying the senator should not be forced to testify. Lea also argued that \u201cconstitutional immunity\u201d cannot be pierced \u201cfor a fishing expedition,\u201d adding that \u201cthey have shown nothing other than un-sided allegations.\u201d Election deniers are one step closer to taking control of voting in 4 key states Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat who is leading the investigation into Trump and his allies, said in court filings that Graham\u2019s actions appear interconnected with the former President, and that the grand jury needed to hear from Graham about at least two calls Graham made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and his staff in the wake of the 2020 election. \u201cDuring the telephone calls, (Graham) questioned Secretary Raffensperger and his staff about reexamining certain absentee ballots cast in Georgia in order to explore the possibility of a more favorable outcome for former President Donald Trump,\u201d Willis wrote in her court filing seeking Graham\u2019s testimony. \u201cThe Witness also made reference to allegations of widespread voter fraud in the November 2020 election in Georgia, consistent with public statements made by known affiliates of the Trump Campaign,\u201d she said in the court documents. Donald Wakeford, Fulton\u2019s chief senior assistant district attorney, fired back during the federal court hearing that he believes Graham\u2019s sovereign immunity is not applicable in this case. \u201cWe believe a total quashal is not appropriate,\u201d Wakeford argued to May, who asked lawyers on both sides lots of questions throughout the hearing. \u201cIn the midst of an ongoing recount for the election of Senator\u2019s Graham\u2019s political ally, he called the official in another state charged with the supervising recount and suggested he change his methods,\u201d Wakeford wrote in court files. Graham also recently hired former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn to help argue his case, who was in court last Wednesday but left the arguing in front of May to his colleague. A bipartisan group of six former top Department of Justice officials, US attorneys and federal prosecutors also provided a detailed briefing to the court explaining why they believe that Graham does not have absolute legislative immunity, and thus should testify to the grand jury and answer questions that are not subject to \u201cSpeech or Debate\u201d privilege. May, an Obama appointee, also previously denied US Rep. Jody Hice\u2019s request to quash his subpoena to appear in front of the special grand jury. She ruled at a hearing last month that she will remand the case back to the Superior Court of Fulton County for Hice to raise any objections to specific questions posed by the special purpose grand jury. Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s top election official who is up for reelection this November, was the first witness to testify in front of the special purpose grand jury this May. He told CNN in November 2020 that Graham hinted that Raffensperger should try to discard some Georgia ballots during a statewide audit. GOP Rep. Jody Hice challenges subpoena from Georgia DA in Trump election probe \u201cHe asked if the ballots could be matched back to the voters,\u201d Raffensperger told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d at the time. \u201cAnd then he, I got the sense it implied that then you could throw those out for any, if you look at the counties with the highest frequent error of signatures. So that\u2019s the impression that I got.\u201d\u2019 \u201cIt was just an implication of, \u2018Look hard and see how many ballots you could throw out,\u2019\u201d Raffensperger added. Asked if he was trying to pressure the secretary of state to toss legal ballots, Graham told CNN at the time, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Graham said he was trying to figure out how signatures were verified on mail-in ballots for a variety of battleground states. Willis has detailed the far-reaching scope of the investigation, saying that it includes potential \u201csolicitation of election fraud, the making of false statements to state and local governmental bodies, conspiracy, racketeering, violation of oath of office and any involvement in violence or threats related to the election\u2019s administration.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Liz Cheney has posed the question with which America may have to wrestle for months to come: if there is evidence that ex-President Donald Trump committed crimes in seeking to overturn the 2020 election, what message will it send if he\u2019s not charged? The Wyoming representative, who serves as the vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021,  issued what was effectively a challenge to the Justice Department as CNN exclusively reported on Thursday that Trump\u2019s lawyers are in talks with its prosecutors \u2013 in the most concrete step yet toward the former commander-in-chief. Cheney says DOJ not prosecuting Trump if there's evidence could call into question the US as 'nation of laws' The news was the latest sign that the department, criticized for months for moving too slowly to investigate Trump\u2019s election stealing effort and his incitement of the mob that invaded the US Capitol, is moving with speed and broadening its scope \u2013 though there remains no indication when or even if the former President will be charged in the Justice Department\u2019s probe. Cheney argued in an interview with CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt taped Wednesday that if the Justice Department failed to act in the face of evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it would be disastrous to the idea of America itself. \u201cUnderstanding what it means if the facts and the evidence are there, and they decide not to prosecute \u2013 how do we then call ourselves a nation of laws?,\u201d said Cheney, one of two Republicans on the panel. CNN senior legal analyst Preet Bharara said that the fact that Trump\u2019s lawyers are already in communication with the investigation suggests they believe he may have some significant exposure down the line. \u201cActively engaging suggests to me that the lawyers think that there is some jeopardy here and they should engage sooner rather than later,\u201d Bharara, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. Bharara cautioned that the investigation could last a long time and that a decision \u201cabout whether or not to charge Donald Trump\u201d could occur many months from now. Learning what Trump was saying and thinking as his mob smashed its way into the US Capitol and during his prior schemes designed to overturn his election loss could help establish whether the ex-President acted with corrupt intent and could be at risk of being criminally charged. Exclusive: Trump lawyers in talks with Justice Department about January 6 criminal probe More immediately, the dialogue with Trump\u2019s lawyers could also be the curtain raiser to what may well be a critical legal fight over the extent to which Trump \u2013 as an ex-President \u2013 can assert executive privilege over conversations and advice he received while in office. Such a case could go all the way to the Supreme Court and in itself break new legal ground since there is little litigation on the issue concerning out-of-office presidents. Executive privilege is the custom under which private conversations and advice given to a president can remain private, especially from Congress, under the doctrine of separation of powers. The potential legal battle that Trump\u2019s often risible privilege claims may spark could push the Justice Department investigation into the middle of the ex-President\u2019s likely 2024 campaign. This would risk yet another national political conflagration on top of many ignited by the 45th President. But more broadly, the latest news about the Justice Department inquiry shows that there is an aggressive criminal probe that is narrowing in on a former President of the United States \u2013 a historical watershed \u2013 after an administration that is still tearing at the guardrails of the democratic system even out of office. This does not necessarily mean that Trump will be charged. A criminal investigation requires a far higher level of proof than the House select committee, which has painted a damning picture of Trump\u2019s actions ahead of the Capitol insurrection. And Trump has made a life\u2019s work of escaping legal scrapes and attempts to enforce accountability. In his presidency alone, he wriggled free from the Russia investigation. He was the first President to be impeached twice by the House, although he wasn\u2019t convicted in Senate trials or barred from future federal office. Still, according to the new CNN report, Trump\u2019s team has warned him there may be indictments resulting from the grand jury investigation. And sources say the former President has asked his advisers whether he is in personal legal jeopardy. Kimberly Wehle, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett that the contacts between Trump\u2019s lawyers and prosecutors pointed to a legal joust over the scope of executive privilege. \u201cI think that Donald Trump is going to lose that battle, but the fact that his lawyers are engaging in this and telling him that he better beware, indictments could come, I think is very serious news for the former President but very good news for democracy, the rule of law and the Constitution,\u201d Wehle said. The latest revelations about the grand jury probe reinforce signs that the Justice Department is acting with speed and expansive scope to investigate the insurrection following months of complaints \u2013 even from members of the House select committee \u2013 that it did not appear to be that active. This in turn raises the possibility that yet another significant period of national trauma caused by Trump could lie ahead. The former President has already claimed that the Biden administration is weaponizing the Justice Department to pursue its political enemies \u2013 a charge many critics leveled against him while he was still president. Trump would be sure to react to any signs that he is a target of the investigation or the possible indictments of those around him by claiming that he is being victimized by a politicized investigation. Given his hold over his supporters, and a record of inciting violence, political tensions could become acute. All of this will sharpen the dilemma that Attorney General Merrick Garland would face if the evidence from the criminal probe suggests a prosecution is merited. Indicting a former President \u2013 especially one running for the White House again \u2013 would incite a political storm. This must raise the question of whether targeting Trump would be in the broader national interest outside the criminal context. At the same time, failing to pursue an ex-President accused of helping to foment a coup attempt could create an equally dangerous precedent and send a signal to future aberrant Presidents. The most significant news yet about the Justice Department criminal probe follows unmistakable signs of a comprehensive and quickening investigation. The department has, for instance, subpoenaed former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and ex-deputy counsel Patrick Philbin. Last week, it emerged that two of former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s most senior aides, former chief of staff Marc Short and former counsel Greg Jacob, have already spoken to the grand jury. Investigators recently obtained a second warrant to search the cellphone of conservative lawyer John Eastman, one of the key figures in pushing Pence to overturn the 2020 election by rejecting electors from important swing states. Federal investigators in June carried out a pre-dawn search of the home of former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times in a deposition to the House select committee. In the latest reporting by CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz, Kara Scannell, Gabby Orr and Kristen Holmes, sources revealed that some members of Trump\u2019s legal team discussed possible defense strategies on at least two occasions in recent months. This comes as they await developments not solely in the Justice Department investigation but in a separate probe by officials in Georgia into Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s election victory in the crucial state in 2020. Trump has grilled his attorneys on whether they actually believe he will face formal charges, but he has expressed skepticism that he will be indicted, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. The CNN team also reveals that Trump has ignored advice from advisers to avoid speaking to former and current aides who have become entangled in the House select committee probe and could be drawn in by the criminal investigation. When it comes to the issue of executive privilege, historical precedent could work against the former President. During the Watergate scandal, then-President Richard Nixon asserted executive privilege to try to prevent the handover of incriminating audio tapes. But in a ruling that could be significant in Trump\u2019s case, the Supreme Court said that executive privilege could not be used to thwart the administration of criminal justice. The House January 6 committee did not litigate the question of Cipollone\u2019s reluctance to talk about certain conversations with Trump on the basis of executive privilege. It is racing against a ticking clock since it is likely to be disbanded by pro-Trump Republicans in the House if control of the chamber changes after the midterm elections in November. But the Justice Department has the luxury of more time to conduct a legal fight. And the possibility of a prolonged investigation is one reason many observers believe Trump is leaning toward an early announcement of a 2024 presidential campaign, which would enable him to rile up his supporters by arguing that the investigation is a politicized attempt by the Biden administration to keep him from reclaiming the White House.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team is in direct communication with Justice Department officials, the first sign of talks between the two sides as the criminal probe into January 6, 2021, accelerates, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. The talks revolve around whether Trump would be able to shield conversations he had while he was president from federal investigators. In recent weeks, investigators have moved aggressively into Trump\u2019s orbit, subpoenaing top former White House officials, focusing on efforts to overturn the 2020 election and executing searches of lawyers who sought to aid those efforts. Latest subpoenas suggest DOJ probe could be aiming squarely at Trump The Trump team\u2019s discussions are with the US attorney\u2019s office in Washington, DC, which is in charge of the investigation, and its top January 6 prosecutor Thomas Windom, the sources said. The conversations have not been previously reported. At this stage, the conversations are focused mostly on whether any communications that witnesses from the Trump West Wing had with the former President can be kept from a federal criminal grand jury under Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege, the people said. The Justice Department has been anticipating a court fight with Trump over executive privilege. The issue has arisen as grand jury subpoenas have been issued to two former White House counsel\u2019s office officials and to former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief counsel and chief of staff. Trump\u2019s legal defense team has warned him that indictments are possible, sources tell CNN. Some members of Trump\u2019s legal team have discussed his potential defense strategies on at least two occasions in recent months, according to two sources familiar with the matter, as they brace for new developments in the Justice Department probe and a separate investigation by Georgia officials into his potentially criminal meddling in the state\u2019s 2020 election results. Rolling Stone previously reported that Trump had been briefed. Trump has grilled his attorneys on whether they actually believe he will face formal charges, sources said. Yet the former President has expressed a heavy dose of skepticism that he will be indicted, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. Another source close to the former President told CNN that Trump also has posed questions about a potential indictment to members of his inner circle, some of whom believe the President is concerned about the possibility of federal charges. But one person close to Trump said he is noticeably more engaged when he is chatting with friends and advisers about the 2022 midterms and his possible presidential campaign in 2024 than he has been during briefings on legal strategy. First on CNN: DHS to stop wiping phones without backups This person described the former President as dismissive in conversations about his legal troubles, often repeating his \u201cwitch hunt\u201d mantra as he claims the various probes he\u2019s facing are plainly driven by political opponents. A Trump spokesman said in a statement to CNN: \u201cThere is clearly a concerted effort to undermine the vital, Constitutionally-rooted Executive and Attorney-Client Privileges through partisan, political persecution.\u201d \u201cHow can any future President ever have private conversations with his attorneys, counselors, and other senior advisors if any such advisor is forced, either during or after the Presidency, in front of an Unselect Committee or other entity, and be forced to reveal those privileged, confidential discussions?\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cPresident Trump will not be deterred by witch hunts or kangaroo courts from continuing to defend and fight for America, our Constitution, and the Truth.\u201d The Justice Department declined to comment. In recent months, the former President has ignored advice from some of his advisers to avoid speaking with former and current aides who have become entangled in the House select committee\u2019s probe into January 6 and may become part of the criminal investigation, people familiar with the matter told CNN. Trump has specifically been counseled to cut contact with his former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, whose actions leading up to and on the day of the US Capitol insurrection have been deeply scrutinized by the House panel, the people said. Ex-Trump aide says Trump admitted privately that he lost the election Two of Meadows\u2019 former top aides, Cassidy Hutchinson and Alyssa Farah Griffin, also have been highly critical of Trump, with Hutchinson testifying about damaging details about Trump\u2019s actions on January 6 during her public testimony before the House panel in June. Hutchinson is cooperating in the DOJ probe as well. Some of Trump\u2019s attorneys believe Meadows could also be in investigators\u2019 crosshairs and are concerned he could become a fact witness if he is pushed to cooperate in the Justice Department probe, according to two people familiar with the matter. In response, Meadows\u2019 attorney George Terwilliger told CNN on Thursday: \u201cAll of that is idle and uninformed speculation, apparently by people that know little but talk a lot.\u201d Former White House attorney Ty Cobb said Meadows is \u201cperfectly positioned to be the John Dean of this mess,\u201d referring to the former Richard Nixon aide who offered crucial public testimony during the Watergate hearings. \u201cThe reason [Meadows] is valuable is also the reason he is in jeopardy: He was basically at Trump\u2019s right hand throughout all these exercises and participated in key meetings and phone calls,\u201d Cobb said. Yet, according to a source familiar with the relationship, Trump and Meadows have spoken a number of times. Another source close to Trump described their relationship as \u201cnot the same as it once was\u201d while they served in the White House, but insisted they still maintained a relationship, even as Trump has complained about Meadows in his recent conversations with other allies. Meadows has been known to attend fundraisers and events at the former President\u2019s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, where he also helped organize a donor retreat last April for the Conservative Partnership Institute, a group he runs with former Republican Sen. Jim DeMint. The securing of Trump\u2019s endorsement for US Senate candidate Ted Budd \u201cwas the last time Meadows was really around regularly. Since then, he\u2019s never been a big part of the political operation or [Trump\u2019s] thought process,\u201d said a second person close to Trump. CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "\u201cThis is probably bad \u2026 for former President Trump.\u201d With dry understatement, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the House select committee investigating the insurrection, summed up on CNN on Wednesday a significant turn in the Department of Justice probe into the mob attack on the US Capitol and the effort to overturn the 2020 election. News of grand jury subpoenas for former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and former deputy counsel Patrick Philbin, the latter of which was first reported by CNN, is the latest sign that department investigators are reaching inside Trump\u2019s inner circle during his final days in the White House. FIRST ON CNN: Former Deputy White House counsel subpoenaed in January 6 probe These developments, which are the clearest indication yet that Trump is in the investigation\u2019s sights, suggest the effort to find the truth will survive even if Republicans win the House this fall and shut down the select committee. Unlike the House investigation, the Justice Department would be able to bring criminal charges against former Trump administration officials if it chooses. It follows that the department is seeking to litigate executive privilege claims that Trump is likely to make in an effort to thwart the investigation. This also suggests that the department, after months of complaints from House select committee members and others that it was not acting quickly enough, is moving with alacrity. Evidence of an expanding Justice Department investigation came amid new signs of the political power of Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud. Candidates touting his falsehoods won Republican primaries in Arizona and Michigan on Tuesday, and could be in a position to influence future elections if they beat Democratic rivals in November. And the probe is also unfolding amid a widening controversy over texts missing from government phones used by the Defense Department and the US Secret Service during the period around January 6, 2021. CNN reported on Wednesday, for example, that the Secret Service may temporarily disable text messaging on employee cell phones as the agency scrambles to respond to concerns it may have erased messages. The disappearance of messages could be coincidental, but given the explosive post-election events, it\u2019s raised suspicion. Both Cipollone and Philbin were subpoenaed, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. They were both close to Trump inside the White House in the fraught days after the 2020 election and in the run-up to the Capitol insurrection. The department sought their testimony after the grand jury also heard from two key members of former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s brain trust, his former chief of staff Marc Short and legal counsel Greg Jacob. Secret Service may disable text messaging on employees' phones, memo states Cipollone has also been a key figure in the House committee\u2019s televised hearings, which have used him to highlight the potential illegality of Trump\u2019s actions and refusal to intervene to quash the Capitol riot. The committee\u2019s star witness, Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified that Cipollone warned staff could be charged with countless crimes if they let Trump go to the Capitol on January 6. In his own deposition before the committee, Cipollone declined to divulge details of his personal conversations with the then-President on privilege grounds. But with its longer timeline and resources, the Justice Department may have more power to overcome this obstacle, either in negotiations with Cipollone or through the courts. Until it emerged that Cipollone and Philbin and the two key Pence aides were sought for grand jury testimony, it was not possible to establish whether the department was looking directly at the ex-President\u2019s role in disrupting the peaceful transfer of power. But given the proximity of the two White House counsels, in particular, to the then-President, the line of inquiry now appears much clearer. \u201cYou don\u2019t call in the White House counsel, the deputy White House counsel, particularly in the wake of the testimony that they gave to the 1/6 committee, unless you are looking squarely and directly at Donald Trump,\u201d Preet Bharara, a former US attorney for the Southern District of New York, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d on Wednesday. Cipollone and Philbin could give investigators insight into Trump\u2019s statements, actions and state of mind on one of the most perilous days in American history. That could be important to establishing whether he had corrupt intent to break the law. Cipollone\u2019s testimony might also be threatening to Trump if executive privilege constraints are lifted since he has a reputation for integrity and telling the truth. Among other revelations, Cipollone told the House select committee in closed-door videotaped testimony that he thought Trump should have conceded the election and that Pence deserved the Presidential Medal of Freedom for not aiding the effort to overturn the election in Congress. Any appearance by Cipollone would, however, probably have to await a court battle on executive privilege, which allows a president to get private advice on key issues and cases and expect that it will be protected from inquiries from Congress under the doctrine of separation of powers. CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown reported on Tuesday that Cipollone and his attorneys were in discussions with Justice Department officials about a grand jury appearance and how to deal with executive privilege issues. Trump has repeatedly made vast claims of executive privilege that stretch to advisers and communications far beyond conventional understandings of its scope \u2013 and he\u2019s likely to do so again. Potentially, a court fight over Cipollone testimony could go all the way up to the Supreme Court. During the Watergate scandal, then-President Richard Nixon asserted executive privilege to try to prevent the handover of incriminating audio tapes. But in a ruling that could be significant in Trump\u2019s case, the Supreme Court said that executive privilege could not be used to thwart the administration of criminal justice. In addition, the courts do not have a long track record of rulings on how far a former President can go with executive privilege, so any legal contest between Trump and the Department of Justice could cover significant new ground. Justice Department sues former Trump adviser Peter Navarro for emails from his private account The House January 6 committee did not litigate the question of Cipollone\u2019s reluctance to talk about certain conversations with Trump. It is racing against a ticking clock since it is likely to be disbanded by pro-Trump Republicans in the House if control of the chamber changes after the midterm elections in November. But the Justice Department has the luxury of more time to conduct a legal fight. \u201cI am optimistic that the Department of Justice can win this,\u201d former federal prosecutor Shan Wu said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d Wednesday, cautioning, however, that it could take months for a legal process to be resolved. That means a Justice Department investigation could go on well into next year at least. So even if the congressional probe expires, there will be at least one venue in which Trump could face accountability. This possibility of a prolonged investigation is one reason many observers believe Trump is leaning toward an early announcement of a 2024 presidential campaign. This would make it easier for the former President to argue that the investigation is a politicized attempt by the Biden administration to weaponize the Justice Department to try to keep him from reclaiming the White House. Still, evidence of investigation does not mean proof of guilt. While the revelations of the televised House hearings have been shocking, and demonstrated a higher involvement by the ex-President in the January 6 coup attempt than was previously known, Attorney General Merrick Garland would still face a profound dilemma in deciding whether to prosecute the ex-President. The House committee\u2019s hearings have painted a damning picture, but they have also cherry picked from depositions and available evidence and did not include cross-examinations that could pick holes in witness testimony. A criminal case requires a higher bar of proof than a congressional inquiry. The gravity of prosecuting a former President suggests that Garland would have to be especially convinced of getting a conviction. A criminal case against Trump would also raise the question of whether such a process, which could rock the United States to its core and set precedents for future former Presidents, is truly in the national interest, however damning the evidence. Conversely, establishing a principle that a President could evade legal accountability for trying to overturn an election could be equally ruinous to America\u2019s democratic system and freedoms. In one sense, the January 6 committee and its success in getting deep inside the ex-President\u2019s West Wing and exposing the plot to steal the election may be easing Garland\u2019s decision making process. While Trump is sure to claim he\u2019s a political victim if charged, the mountain of evidence \u2013 including horrifying testimony and graphic video of his mob attacking the Capitol \u2013 is serving to prepare the public and shape its perceptions of what really really happened. This may marginally defuse accusations that any prosecution of the ex-President is a purely political exercise. Even so, every day that signs point closer to a possible indictment of Trump \u2013 or a controversial decision not to pursue him \u2013 is one step closer to what would inevitably be a period of extraordinary national trauma.

            "article_content": "The former deputy counsel to President Donald Trump has been subpoenaed in the federal criminal probe of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, two sources familiar with the matter tell CNN. Patrick Philbin was subpoenaed for testimony and documents, according to one of the sources. Philbin worked in the White House counsel\u2019s office under Pat Cipollone, who also was also subpoenaed for documents and testimony, according to sources. Philbin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. What Donald Trump's Cabinet can tell January 6 investigators Executive privilege will play a role in the discussions over Philbin\u2019s grand jury testimony, as it has with recent grand jury testimony of Cipollone and vice presidential advisers Marc Short and Greg Jacob. Philbin and Cipollone were both key witnesses to Trump\u2019s actions in the last days of his presidency. Cipollone repeatedly pushed back on efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and according to a Senate Judiciary Committee report, he and Philbin opposed a proposal to replace the attorney general with someone willing to look into false claims of election fraud. The report said that both Philbin and Cipollone indicated that they would resign should such a plan be executed. Philbin has already testified about the Capitol attack in a separate probe: earlier this year he appeared before the House select committee investigating January 6, CNN previously reported. During Cipollone\u2019s own testimony before the House committee, he told investigators that on January 6 he was joined by a number of top Trump advisers \u2013 including Philbin \u2013 in pushing the former President to issue a strong condemnation of the attack. CNN reported last October that Philbin was at the time among a cadre of attorneys from the Trump White House or campaign still at work for the former-President and now focused on more narrow tasks, such as handling executive privilege discussions with the National Archives or communicating with potential ex-White House witnesses called to Capitol Hill.

            "article_content": "The House select committee and the Justice Department are now coming for all the ex-President\u2019s men and women. The expanding scope of the probes into former President Donald Trump\u2019s bid to thwart the transfer of power to President Joe Biden\u2019s administration heralds growing peril for Trump and his deepest, inner circle. There are growing signs that investigators are seeking, and securing, testimony into exactly what Trump said, did and tried to do in the fraught days inside the West Wing ahead of the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The former President and likely 2024 White House candidate is now facing a two-front challenge from big-time Washington investigations. The House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack has been up and running for months, and it held televised hearings all summer that presented chilling new details about Trump\u2019s actions after he lost the election to Biden. The full extent of a Justice Department investigation has only become clear this week \u2013 and is crucial since it could potentially lead to criminal charges against key players in the drama. Mick Mulvaney, ex-White House acting chief of staff, testifies before the January 6 committee Both probes are accelerating and are gathering testimony from senior officials around Trump, with the former President\u2019s Cabinet of special interest. Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, ex-Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, former Acting Secretary of Defense Chris Miller and former Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen have already spoken to the House select committee. The panel has been in talks with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for a deposition. Sources told CNN the committee is negotiating terms for a potential interview with former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. And some of the moments of the recent televised hearings that damaged Trump the most came from taped testimony from ex-Attorney General William Barr \u2013 though he left the Cabinet before the January 6 conflagration. On Thursday, the committee met with former acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was also out of the West Wing at the bitter end of the Trump administration serving as Northern Ireland envoy, though he was in contact with senior officials. The Justice Department has also been busy. It emerged this week that Marc Short and Greg Jacob, former senior staffers to former Vice President Mike Pence, went before the federal grand jury in Washington. And CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz and Evan Perez reported exclusively on Thursday that the Justice Department is girding for a legal battle to force testimony from senior former officials on issues that Trump has claimed may be subject to executive privilege. A move this aggressive suggests litigation \u2013 with the potential to go all the way to the Supreme Court, which could prolong the investigation and potentially pitch it right into the middle of the 2024 presidential campaign that Trump is poised to join. But it\u2019s also a sign of intent inside the Justice Department investigation following weeks of publicly expressed frustration, including from House select committee members, that it was dragging its feet on a criminal investigation. \u201cThis tells me that the DOJ is bracing for battle,\u201d CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said on \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d on Thursday. CNN\u2019s Perez reported that the two former Pence aides were able to provide significant information to the grand jury. And Carrie Cordero, a former senior Justice Department official who is now a CNN analyst, said the Justice Department\u2019s nascent legal gambit to combat Trump\u2019s executive privilege claims suggested that Jacob and Short had more to say \u201cbut did not.\u201d EXCLUSIVE: Prosecutors prepare for court battle to force former White House officials to testify about Trump's January 6 conversations \u201cIt is an investigative step and it indicates the Justice Department is really thinking through ahead of time how it would do this,\u201d Cordero said. It\u2019s impossible to get full visibility from inside either investigation, especially the more recently detailed Justice Department version. But the focus on former Cabinet members and senior former White House staffers is an obvious sign investigators are homing in on Trump\u2019s actions, moods and conversations following the 2020 election and in the run-up to the insurrection. There is so far no clear indication that the ex-President is a direct target of the January 6 criminal investigation, which appears to be at an earlier stage than the House select committee\u2019s probe, which is painting a devastating picture of his actions. But Cabinet officials and other aides around Trump were in meetings or close to the President during the fraught post-election days. They saw and heard events that could be incriminating or informational for investigators seeking to assess the former President\u2019s culpability in attempts to thwart the peaceful transfer of power to a new administration. They may also help to establish Trump\u2019s state of mind \u2013 an important factor in establishing intent to commit wrongdoing and a key part of any potential criminal case. Investigators may be interested, for example, in getting clarity on the level of direction Trump gave in the scheme to create fake electors as he sought to thwart the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s victory. The kind of information that Cabinet members could offer was teased out during one of the House hearings. Scalia said in taped testimony that he wrote a memo to Trump to request a Cabinet meeting after the insurrection. In the document, Scalia, then the labor secretary, made clear that it was time for Trump to stop publicly questioning the election results since, as he said, after the mob attack on the Capitol, \u201cNo one can deny this is harmful.\u201d During her blockbuster appearance before the committee last month, Cassidy Hutchinson, the former aide to ex-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified that one reason Trump delivered a speech on the day after the insurrection was that there was \u201clarge concern\u201d in the White House that Pence and the Cabinet could invoke the 25th Amendment in order to remove him from power. In practice, given the complex procedures such a step would require and the fact that the administration was almost over, that didn\u2019t happen. Pence declined to initiate the process. And Short told CNN on Thursday that \u201cthis was really just a political ploy by Nancy Pelosi and Democrats in Congress to try to put pressure to exert this and it was never going anywhere in our White House.\u201d Jan. 6 committee expands interest into possible use of the 25th Amendment against Trump with Mnuchin and other Cabinet interviews But the fact that there was even apparent talk of the 25th Amendment, which gives the vice president and a majority of top officers of executive departments the power to inform Congress that the President can no longer discharge his duties, will be of interest to both investigations. And it\u2019s becoming more clear by the week that one goal of the House panel is to build a case to Americans that Trump is unfit to get near the power of the presidency ever again. Alarming details of wild or lawless behavior by the then-President could bolster that case, which has been voiced by both committee Chair Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican. \u201cWhen you are putting together a case, you want to prove the target\u2019s state of mind,\u201d former federal prosecutor Jennifer Rodgers told \u201cCNN Newsroom\u201d on Thursday. \u201cThe 25th Amendment stuff is not so interesting as far as the machinations behind who might be for it, who might be against. But in terms of what they are saying to one another \u2026 what they saw President Trump do and heard him say in the days leading up to January 6,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThese are people with really close access to the President. These are his own Cabinet members who he chose and put there.\u201d The prospect of testifying before either investigation has been an unpalatable one for some former key figures of Trump\u2019s orbit who have not repudiated him publicly. But taped testimony of ex-officials under oath has produced some key revelations that might not otherwise have come out, such as that of former White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who painted a fraught picture of the chaos inside the White House in the run-up to the insurrection. January 6 committee intends to share 20 transcripts with the Justice Department It is one thing for former officials like Mulvaney, who have criticized the ex-President publicly and may not run for office again, to testify. But others face a balancing act. Pompeo, for example, clearly has future presidential aspirations and would be loath to alienate Trump\u2019s vital political base after years being publicly loyal to the former President. Asked Thursday on Fox whether he would testify to the House committee, the former secretary of state and Kansas congressman was torn between his obligation to appear and a desire to indicate to conservative voters that he believed the committee is a political forum. \u201cAs I always did when I was in service to America, I am happy to cooperate with things that are fair, and transparent, and deliver good outcomes to the American people,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure the American people get the full story of the things that happened in the Trump administration.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s comment left open the possibility that he could give testimony while still arguing to Trump supporters that he had defended the ex-President. It\u2019s a delicate dance that many others of Trump\u2019s former Cabinet officials may soon also find themselves doing.",

            "article_content": "Justice Department prosecutors are preparing to fight in court to force former White House officials to testify about then-President Donald Trump\u2019s conversations and actions around January 6, according to people briefed on the matter. At issue are claims of executive privilege that prosecutors expect the former president to make in order to shield some information from the federal grand jury as the criminal investigation moves deeper into the ranks of White House officials who directly interacted with Trump. DOJ\u2019s preemptive move is the clearest sign yet that federal investigators are homing in on Trump\u2019s conduct as he tried to prevent the transfer of power to Joe Biden. An executive privilege court fight would immediately put the Justice Department\u2019s investigation into a more aggressive stance than even the Mueller investigation \u2013 a major years-long criminal probe into Trump while he was President. He was not ultimately charged. Attorney General Merrick Garland has made clear in public remarks that Trump is not beyond the reach of the investigation because of his status as a former president.\u202f He has also stressed they are taking care to \u201cget this right.\u201d Trump DOJ official cooperating with Justice Department's criminal Jan 6. probe Confronting the privilege issue reflects the care with which the Justice Department is taking as it faces the unusual situation of investigating of a former president for actions taken while in office. And it could bring about one of the first major court fights over the separation of powers in the January 6 criminal investigation. Trump\u2019s attempt to maintain secrecy\u202fcame up most recently in\u202fthe federal grand jury testimony of Marc Short and Greg Jacob, close aides to former Vice President Mike Pence. Before their recent grand jury testimony, prosecutors, along with lawyers for Short and Jacob, outlined some questions they would avoid in order to steer clear of potential privilege issues, with the expectation that they could return to those questions at a later date, the people briefed on the matter said. Merrick Garland does not rule out charging Trump and others in January 6 probe Neither would answer\u202fquestions about their direct interactions with Trump when they testified\u202fin the criminal investigation\u202fin recent weeks, according to two people familiar with the matter. Short, Pence\u2019s former chief of staff, and Jacob, his former chief counsel, both were present in an Oval Office meeting on January 4, 2021, where Trump pressured Pence to go along with a plan presented by attorney John Eastman to block certification of the election results. Despite the privilege issues, the witnesses spent hours answering questions to the grand jury about the pressure campaign on Pence, which Trump was part of, while avoiding direct questions about the former president, according to people briefed on the matter. The questions prosecutors asked indicated that investigators are zeroing in on the role of Trump and others such as Eastman, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and others in the broader scheme to block the certification of election results and to organize a set of fake electors who would keep Trump in office despite him losing the election, according to the people briefed. Jacob and Short\u2019s approach with the Justice Department so far is in line with\u202fwhat they did with\u202fthe House select committee, according to one source, avoiding answering some questions about what Trump said around January 6. Jan. 6 committee expands interest into possible use of the 25th Amendment against Trump with Mnuchin and other Cabinet interviews The extent of a former president\u2019s executive privilege to shield testimony in a criminal investigation remains unsettled law, and Justice Department officials believe Trump is likely to try to assert his claims as he has in the House select committee\u2019s investigation of January 6. Also clear, given the hurdles on privilege and the outreach to other witnesses, is that prosecutors are still in early stages of examining any direct Trump role. Prosecutors appear to be much further along in their investigation of the Trump allies who were orchestrating the scheme to keep him in office, the people briefed said. Short is represented by Emmet Flood, a prominent Washington lawyer who is known to be a staunch defender of presidential privilege. Flood and Jacob\u2019s lawyer declined to comment for this story.\u202fAn attorney handling privilege issues for Trump didn\u2019t respond to inquiries from CNN on Thursday. Why ex-Pence aide's grand jury testimony is a big deal Previously, courts have ruled against Trump\u2019s efforts to protect his White House papers from being handed over to the House select committee. The Biden administration largely has chosen not to assert privilege claims around January 6, making Trump\u2019s assertions as the former president weaker than if he were still in office. If another court fight materializes related to January 6 grand jury proceedings investigating Trump, officials overseeing the investigation believe the Justice Department has a strong likelihood of winning such a fight, Courts generally have viewed executive privilege claims to be more easily cleared away in criminal investigations, compared to congressional probes. In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled to release the Watergate tapes, despite a presidential executive privilege claim, during the investigation of then-President Richard Nixon, a landmark ruling that hastened the end of Nixon\u2019s presidency. And during the Clinton administration, the federal court of appeals in DC ruled against administration privilege claims multiple times \u2013 and did so relatively quickly. The Supreme Court didn\u2019t stand in the way of criminal investigators then. \u201cI think it would be effortless for the Department of Justice to litigate and win this\u201d if the issue arises with Trump trying to block a DOJ investigation, the former White House counsel Neil Eggleston said this week.\u202fEggleston\u202fargued the privilege issues in court on behalf of the White House in the 1990s. \u201cThis happens in days. This does not take very long,\u201d Eggleston added. Eggleston described a balancing test judges must use following the Nixon ruling, where the need for presidential secrecy is often not enough to overcome the needs of a federal grand jury investigation. The investigation into Clinton, run by then-special counsel Kenneth Starr, got a final ruling in the Justice Department\u2019s favor in under five months of pursuing what the Clinton administration believed should be secret from its White House counsel\u2019s office. And a separate criminal inquiry into a Clinton Cabinet member where investigators sought documents took about two years to reach a final ruling. In Trump\u2019s National Archives case against the House investigators in recent months, the Supreme Court resolved the dispute in three months. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack will enter a crucial fact-finding phase in August as it pursues new leads and revisits previously reluctant witnesses to prepare for more hearings in September. After a series of eight jam-packed hearings, the committee feels it has so much more information to share that it will balance hearing prep with the writing of its final report, which is also slated to be released this fall ahead of the November midterm elections. August is expected to be a busy month, but almost all of that work will happen behind the scenes. The committee is still gathering evidence and has reengaged in negotiations with some witnesses who had previously resisted sitting for a deposition, sources told CNN. The committee could also call back witnesses it has interviewed previously, to corroborate new details, sources added. January 6 committee could subpoena Ginni Thomas \u201cIn the course of these hearings, we have received new evidence, and new witnesses have bravely stepped forward,\u201d GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who serves as committee vice chair, said during Thursday\u2019s hearing. \u201cEfforts to litigate and overcome immunity and executive privilege claims have been successful, and those continue. Doors have opened, new subpoenas have been issued, and the dam has begun to break.\u201d She added, \u201cWe have considerably more to do. We have far more evidence to share with the American people, and more to gather.\u201d Cheney told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, for example, that the committee could \u201ccontemplate a subpoena\u201d for Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, a conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, if she does not voluntarily meet with the committee over her role in advocating to overturn the 2020 election results. Jan. 6 committee is on collision course with Trump and the midterms Committee members feel they have just scratched the surface in terms of uncovering what\u2019s behind potentially missing text messages from Secret Service personnel from January 5 and 6, 2021, shortly after the messages were requested by oversight officials investigating the agency\u2019s response to the US Capitol attack. The panel has subpoenaed records from the agency, and has received thousands of pages of documents, including radio traffic of then-Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s detail communicating about how to move him to a secure location on January 6, which was used in Thursday night\u2019s hearing. But as of last week, the committee had only received one text message. In August, members want more documents and another briefing from the Department of Homeland Security inspector general. \u201cIt remains a big mystery to me,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, a member on the panel, told CNN last week. Separately, tensions have escalated between the committee and three Secret Service agents who were said to have been involved in a heated exchange with then-President Donald Trump when he was told he could not go to the Capitol after his rally on January 6. Trump\u2019s former deputy White House chief of staff, Tony Ornato, who currently works for the Secret Service, Trump\u2019s former Secret Service lead agent Robert Engel, and the driver of Trump\u2019s motorcade on January 6 have all retained private counsel to engage with the committee, Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California said. \u201cSome of the officers who said they\u2019d be coming and talking under oath, they have not come in and they\u2019ve recently retained private counsel, which is unusual, but they have a right to do that,\u201d Lofgren, a member of the panel, told CNN Thursday. \u201cSo, we\u2019ll see.\u201d First on CNN: Secret Service identified potential missing text messages on phones of 10 individuals All three individuals had engaged with the committee previously, but sources say the committee is pursuing how to interview Engel and the driver in August. Ornato, meanwhile, is considered a different story, in part because he was serving in a political position within the Trump White House on January 6, and members are wary of his willingness to be forthcoming because of his perceived loyalty to the former President, two sources told CNN. Asked Friday if Ornato was cooperating with the panel, Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois bluntly told CNN: \u201cNo.\u201d Former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson testified in June that Ornato told her that Trump was so enraged at his Secret Service detail for blocking him from going to the Capitol on the day of the attack that he \u201creached up towards the front of the vehicle to grab at the steering wheel\u201d and \u201cthen used his free hand to lunge towards\u201d Engel. Ornato\u2019s role in attempting to facilitate Trump\u2019s trip to the Capitol and potential communications with Secret Service agents during that time remain of interest to the committee. At the same time, sources tell CNN the committee has already started writing its report, but there is still much debate over what direction it should go. A key question the committee will have to answer is whether the report should include a criminal referral of Trump. Most members on the panel feel that the hearings have clearly laid out that Trump committed a crime for his role leading up to and on January 6, but believe it is up to the Department of Justice to pursue further. Cheney told Tapper on Sunday that the committee hasn\u2019t made a decision about a criminal referral of Trump. \u201cI sure as hell hope they have a criminal investigation at this point into Donald Trump,\u201d Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria, another member of the panel, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, while noting she had no direct knowledge about the matter. Kinzinger told CNN last week the committee has proven that Trump committed a crime, but \u201cit\u2019s up to Justice now to make a decision.\u201d Even though there appears to be a growing number of previously reluctant witnesses now willing to engage with the committee, there is still a considerable number of individuals refusing to cooperate. One of the biggest question marks is Ginni Thomas, whom committee members said Sunday is engaging with the panel through her attorney but could face a subpoena if she declines to appear voluntarily. \u201cThe committee is engaged with her counsel. We certainly hope that she will agree to come in voluntarily, but the committee is fully prepared to contemplate a subpoena if she does not. I hope it doesn\u2019t get to that. I hope she will come in voluntarily,\u201d Cheney told Tapper on Sunday. \u201cSo, it\u2019s very important for us to speak with her and as I said, I hope she will agree to do so voluntarily, but I\u2019m sure we will contemplate a subpoena if she won\u2019t.\u201d The five House Republicans the committee subpoenaed, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have refused to cooperate with the committee, and the panel has yet to do anything to push these members further. Raskin signaled little appetite to refer House Republicans who have defied subpoenas to DOJ on contempt charges, telling CNN last week it could lead to \u201cwild goose chases.\u201d Many members are approaching August with open minds, letting the investigation play out before determining what the hearings in September will focus on. \u201cYou\u2019re getting way ahead of us,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly a number of significant leads to fill in details that have come in and we\u2019re going to pursue those. We\u2019re going to figure out this whole mystery with Secret Service texts.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Stay tuned. Season two is coming. The prime-time finale of the compelling and highly produced television saga otherwise known as the House January 6 hearings on Thursday presented a horror show of presidential dereliction of duty and a cliffhanger promise to return with even more damaging evidence against Donald Trump in September. At the outset of this summer\u2019s hearings, the select committee faced questions critical to its credibility and its prospects of being one of the few investigatory processes to ever hold Trump to account. The committee has comprehensively answered at least the first three of those questions and made progress on the other two. It has also embroidered a broader narrative of an out-of-control President who put his own fantastical belief he won an election above more than two centuries of democratic tradition and the national interest. And, most chillingly, it is advancing a case \u2013 in the words of a key witness, retired conservative Judge J. Michael Luttig \u2013 that Trump remains \u201ca clear and present danger\u201d to US democracy. As committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, put it after Thursday\u2019s extraordinary hearing, \u201cEvery American must consider this: Can a President who made the choices Donald Trump made during the violence of January 6 ever be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again?\u201d The hearings have painted a far more detailed and horrifying picture of the Capitol insurrection than ever before. It got critical testimony from ex-White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Some of Trump\u2019s younger aides, like Cassidy Hutchinson, who worked for former chief of staff Mark Meadows, displayed great courage to tell the truth \u2013 shaming years of appeasement of the aberrant ex-President by far more senior Republicans and prompting others to come forward with evidence. That evidence has exposed a direct and dominant role by Trump in discrediting the 2020 election, making a false case that he won it, and the cascade of events that led to the worst attack on the US Capitol in more than 200 years. The hearings might best be compared to a prosecution in a court room, with evidence from multiple documentary sources interspersed with videotaped depositions and live testimony from the most compelling witnesses. Cheney often opened hearings with a summary to the audience using language like, \u201cYou will hear how ex-President Trump \u2026\u201d as if she were an attorney addressing a jury, in this case the one at home. This is what the committee has established so far. It is fitting that a President who won office partly because of the image he created on a TV program and whose term unfolded like an unhinged daily reality show should find his conduct eviscerated in a new kind of congressional probe that feels more like a streamable drama than a crusty Capitol Hill hearing. The committee enlisted experienced TV producers to shape its hearings \u2013 two of which unfolded on prime time. Committee members conducting each session worked from a script, as clips of witness depositions were interspersed with other evidence like Capitol Police radio traffic, clips of pitched violence, texts from former White House officials and live testimony. While key figures like Meadows and other close Trump aides sought to stonewall the committee, it used classic investigatory techniques to piece together the story. People from inside Trump\u2019s inner orbit reticent to speak were placed under oath, including his daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner and senior White House officials. Week by week, the shocking video had an effect. More people inside the West Wing on January 6, 2021, came forward. The courage of Hutchinson set off a surge of personal attacks from Trump world. But that may only have opened a spigot to more testimony and evidence. Cipollone came across as balancing his responsibilities to the office of the President and the doctrine of executive privilege with his duty to history and his own sense of right and wrong. In one compelling example from his deposition played Thursday, he left the damning impression that everyone in the White House that day wanted the rioters to go \u2013 except Trump. In another effective technique, the committee decried by pro-Trump Republicans as a partisan scam often used Republicans to make the case against the ex-President. Members of the mob told how they thought they were doing Trump\u2019s wishes because of what he said. GOP officials like Bowers and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger testified to his abuses of power. On Thursday, the committee played footage from Fox showing the carnage that Trump watched in real time. At the start of these hearings, it seemed a stretch that the committee could build a case with criminal implications for the ex-President. That could be changing. Some seasoned lawyers believe that the committee has indeed established evidence of intent by Trump to precipitate the horrendous events leading up to and on January 6 \u2013 an important component to any court case. Yet it is important to remember that as effective as it is, the committee\u2019s case is being made solely from the perspective of a prosecution. The panel is able to select snippets of information most advantageous to its case. There has been no cross-examination of witnesses. Weaknesses or contradictions in their recollection or testimony have not been teased out by a defense lawyer. Then there is the question of whether a potential prosecution of Trump, as a former President, would be in the national interest \u2013 since it could potentially rip even deeper partisan divides in an already internally estranged nation. Establishing a precedent that a former President could be liable to criminal action could be dangerous since it could be misused by future commanders-in-chief to go after their predecessors. These issue could become even more explosive since Trump may soon launch a presidential campaign that would make it easier for him to claim the investigation against him is politically motivated. Yet the weight of evidence already unearthed by the committee poses an equally grave question. What message will it send to future generations if Trump escapes political and criminal accountability for trying to incite a coup against the US government that he was sworn to protect? Attorney General Merrick Garland insisted this week that no one is above the law, sparking fresh speculation about the possibility of a Justice Department investigation and potential prosecution of Trump. Harvard constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe believes the committee\u2019s summer hearings have made that outcome more likely. \u201cThe committee, through witnesses like Cassidy Hutchinson and through the testimony that it has recorded under oath, has painted an extremely strong picture of someone who \u2026 was bound to do anything he could in order to hold onto power,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer Thursday. \u201cI think the committee has made it much easier for a prosecution to be brought partly because the people of the United States have been more fully informed. You have to get people ready for something as unusual as the prosecution of a former President.\u201d",

The year since the House voted to create a select committee to probe the deadly January 6, 2021, insurrection has brought a cascade of revelations about the attack on the US Capitol and how and why it played out, often in excruciating detail. The public has now heard live testimony from more than a dozen witnesses and seen clips from the recorded depositions of more than 40 others, including members of the Trump family, former administration officials, GOP officials from key battleground states, and members of the former President\u2019s legal team. The through line? An exhaustive demonstration of how Trump was repeatedly told by his own advisers that the 2020 presidential election was not stolen, and yet he continued to plot for how to stay in power. The former President knew the protesters who showed up in Washington on January 6 were armed. He not only urged them to march on the Capitol, but had hopes of joining them. It\u2019s a damning portrayal. And unfortunately for Trump, who has regularly asked those around him when the televised hearings are going to end, the panel\u2019s not done just yet. The committee\u2019s last planned public hearing will be held on Thursday at 8 p.m. ET. It has all the makings of a potential blockbuster. Thursday will be the panel\u2019s second prime-time session, an effort to maximize viewership and attention. The committee plans to zero in on Trump\u2019s conduct on January 6, 2021, focusing specifically on his response \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 as rioters breached the Capitol walls and forced lawmakers to flee their chambers.

Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, told CNN the committee will \u201cgo through pretty much minute by minute\u201d the then-President\u2019s actions. \u201cHe was doing nothing to actually stop the riot,\u201d the Virginia Democrat told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d While the panel has not yet said who will testify, CNN previously reported that former Trump White House deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews is expected to be a witness. The panel is also likely to lean heavily on video clips from the deposition of Pat Cipollone, Trump\u2019s former White House counsel. Cipollone sat for a transcribed interview earlier this month, and the committee used clips from the interview 14 times during last Tuesday\u2019s hearing. These witnesses alone could fuel an explosive hearing. But there\u2019s also this: Two members of the committee said Sunday that they expect the panel to receive US Secret Service text messages from January 5 and 6, 2021, by Tuesday, following a subpoena issued last week for the records. The Secret Service has been in the spotlight since witnesses described how Trump angrily demanded that his detail take him to the Capitol following his speech at the Ellipse \u2013 shortly before rioters breached the building. Long-time Trump ally Steve Bannon is set to go on trial on Monday on contempt of Congress charges for his failure to comply with a committee subpoena last year. Earlier this month, Bannon, who has pleaded not guilty, told the committee that he is willing to testify, ideally at a public hearing, according to a letter obtained by CNN. The reversal came after he received a letter from Trump waiving executive privilege, although both the House select committee and federal prosecutors contend that privilege claim never gave Bannon carte blanche to ignore a congressional subpoena in the first place. At a pretrial hearing on Thursday, US District Judge Carl Nichols said he was not deciding yet whether Bannon\u2019s recent bid to testify would be admissible at trial. But by not immediately shutting down Bannon\u2019s efforts to present that evidence, Nichols kept the possibility open that Bannon might have an additional defense to put forward. Nichols said the trial would begin with jury selection on Monday, as he rejected a second Bannon request to push back the start date. Earlier in the week, the judge had dealt another blow to Bannon by granting a request by the House that the judge quash a Bannon trial subpoena for the testimony of several House lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While this week is the last of the January 6 committee\u2019s planned series of public hearings, the panel has said all along that that won\u2019t be the end of its investigation. Kinzinger, one of the committee\u2019s two Republicans, even told the Wall Street Journal in a recent interview that they\u2019re still considering asking Trump to testify and might request a written response from former Vice President Mike Pence or issue a subpoena for him to testify. Both Kinzinger and Luria suggested Sunday there could be more to come. \u201cWhether it\u2019s in the form of hearings or other methods to present the evidence,\u201d Luria told Bash, \u201cwe have a responsibility to present the things that we\u2019ve uncovered and we are talking about how the best way to do that is moving forward after this hearing.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "As their final act nears, the House January 6 hearings have evolved from documenting a stain on history to warning of a violent and tyrannical future that awaits if Donald Trump is allowed to again unleash America\u2019s pent-up extremism. In the latest episode of its limited season television event, the House select committee on Tuesday traced Trump\u2019s links to and inspiration for far right-wing groups that came to Washington to help his mob smash its way into Congress in early 2021. These were the forces that heeded the ex-President\u2019s call to \u201cfight like Hell\u201d to thwart President Joe Biden\u2019s election, including the Oath Keepers militia and the Proud Boys he once told to \u201cstand back, and stand by\u201d on national TV. Takeaways from the January 6 hearing day 7 \u201cWhat else is he going to do if he gets elected again?\u201d former Oath Keepers spokesman Jason Van Tatenhove asked during testimony in which he warned that the ex-President would \u201cwhip up a civil war among his followers, using lies and deceit\u201d if he launches another campaign for the White House in 2024. The scenario he raises is hardly hypothetical since Trump and his true believers never halted his assault on democracy. The former President is escalating his lies about non-existent voter fraud in 2020. He\u2019s salivating about another presidential campaign he would use as a new platform for his misinformation. Countless Republican candidates are running in the midterm elections on his lies about a stolen presidential election. Doubts Trump sowed about election integrity have triggered recent showdowns over certifying results in New Mexico and Pennsylvania and a barrage of state laws that make it harder to vote and easier to interfere in results. And the Trump wing of the Republican Party is still marching toward authoritarianism. For instance, the Conservative Political Action Conference has invited Hungarian strongman Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who rolled back judicial independence, press freedom and democracy, to a Texas conference next month at which Trump is also slated to speak. And in a stunning coda to Tuesday\u2019s hearing, committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said that Trump had placed a call to a witness not yet seen in the hearings, in a possible case of attempted tampering that has been referred to the Justice Department. This continuing effort to undermine American institutions and the rule of law is showing that Trump\u2019s threat to democracy didn\u2019t end in 2021. Whatever impact the committee has on the ex-President\u2019s future political prospects, and whether or not he ends up facing criminal charges, there\u2019s a sense that while documenting Trump\u2019s past transgressions, the committee is also racing to keep up with his new ones. The subtext of Tuesday\u2019s hearing was an effort to expose a seam of far right-wing extremism that exists below the surface of American political life through questions about the militia-style training and aspirations of the Oath Keepers. In retrospect, Trump\u2019s frequent equivocations about such radicals and White supremacist groups and his violence-laced rhetoric at rallies come across as the gradual legitimation of the use of violence to promote a political end. His incitement reached its apex on January 6, 2021. The January 6 hearings are showing how powerful Trump made extremist groups feel This is especially frightening since it mirrors the tactics of foreign despots and extremists in fractured societies abroad where democracy failed. And there\u2019s no sign that the ex-President would abandon this stew of extremism in a future political campaign. His past conduct suggests exactly the opposite. The impression that was left from Tuesday\u2019s hearing \u2013 particularly the details of a heated Oval Office meeting in December 2020 \u2013 was not just that Trump was in the thrall of fanatics with ridiculous plans to steal the election. He was one himself. And it raised the question \u2013 especially since more mainstream members of his inner circle have now broken with him to testify \u2013 about the caliber of people who would surround the ex-President if he succeeds in a quest to reclaim power in 2024. Tuesday\u2019s hearing also implicitly raised the question of why members of such extremist groups have faced justice for their actions on January 6 in multiple court cases while the former President continues to evade legal sanctions for inciting the riot. One of the convicted Capitol rioters Stephen Ayres, testified that he showed up specifically because he was upset after hearing the ex-President\u2019s claims that the 2020 had been stolen. The January 6 insurrection: Minute-by-minute Yet as shocking as Tuesday\u2019s revelations were, and despite strong suggestions that Trump\u2019s words, actions and the activity of some of his most committed enablers helped spark the riot, the hearing did not contain a single moment in which Trump or a proxy was shown to have ordered the extremists into action or knew for certain what they would do. That absence of proof of intent will play into the raging debate over whether the committee has produced a case that could stand up in criminal court after any Justice Department inquiry. Still, the political case that the committee is presenting to the public is compelling and may already be influencing the ex-President\u2019s political strategy. Trump is considering launching a 2024 campaign as early as this month, partly to allow him to present his own high-profile defense against the committee\u2019s findings, CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes reported. This is one indication of how the extraordinary catalogue of evidence that the panel has stacked up \u2013 despite efforts of pro-Trump Republicans to discredit it \u2013 could play into the run-up to November\u2019s midterm elections and the 2024 White House race. Tuesday\u2019s hearing laid out fresh evidence about Trump\u2019s complicity in the January 6 rally. It teased out connections between the ex-President\u2019s supporters, like Roger Stone and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and extremists. It featured new testimony collected from former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone last week, which, although at times was restricted by executive privilege claims, further damaged the ex-President because it exposed his madcap and desperate attempts to cling to office. What we know about infamous Oval Office meeting held by Trump's inner circle in December 2020 The hearing included a barely believable account of a meeting between the then-President and outside advisers, including lawyer Sidney Powell, that descended into a profane shouting match with West Wing officials about schemes to overthrow the election. The committee also played testimony from former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who said her boss, ex-chief of staff Mark Meadows, escorted Rudy Giuliani out of the White House late on that December evening so he could not plant any more ideas in Trump\u2019s mind. That December meeting played an important part in Tuesday\u2019s narrative because it added another layer to the case about Trump\u2019s incitement of the January 6 crowd. Previously, the hearings have advanced a theory that Trump knew his election lies were false because he was told so by multiple officials. But he pressed on, trying to find ever more extreme associates who would tell him what he wanted to hear. Then he turned to the futile attempt to get ex-Vice President Mike Pence to block Biden\u2019s succession with non-existent constitutional tools. Tuesday\u2019s testimony represented an attempt to show that when those avenues failed to overturn the election, according to the committee, Trump turned to mob rule. The panel\u2019s case is that Trump gathered the crowd, gave it a grievance with his election lies and incited its march on Congress, even with the knowledge that many of its members were armed. One question Trump keeps asking: When will the January 6 hearings end? Cheney argued that this pattern of behavior was evidence of culpability and warned against an emerging line of defense in Trump world \u2013 that the President was led astray by unscrupulous advisers like Powell or attorney John Eastman. \u201cThis, of course, is nonsense,\u201d Cheney said, adding that Trump was a \u201c76-year-old man and not an impressionable child. Just like everyone else in our country, he is responsible for his own actions and own choices.\u201d The Wyoming Republican\u2019s latest sharp warning sounded like a veiled suggestion to the Justice Department that Attorney General Merrick Garland should consider a criminal investigation of the former President over his actions on January 6. But in itself, it did not really answer the question of whether there is evidence that Trump ordered, rather than merely incited, the Capitol riot \u2013 a distinction that could be important in court. One of Cheney\u2019s Democratic colleagues, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a constitutional scholar, put the ex-President\u2019s actions into a wider context, as he said his attempt to destroy US democracy was exactly what the Founders had in mind when they built democratic safeguards as they forged a new nation in the 18th century. Arguing that political leaders who incited mobs often turned into tyrants, he posed a question for Americans as Trump is apparently about to seek a return to power. \u201cThe crucial thing is the next step. What this committee, what all of us, will do to fortify our democracy against coups, political violence and campaigns to steal elections away from the people,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cUnlike Mr. Ayres and Mr. Van Tatenhove, people who have recovered and evolved from the descent into the hell of fanaticism, Donald Trump has only expanded on his big lie.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly downplayed the significance of the hearings by the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, has regularly asked those around him in recent days when the televised hearings are going to end \u2013 underscoring his private fixation on the damning revelations revealed by some of the committee\u2019s witnesses. The six public hearings held thus far have been more effective than many in Trump\u2019s orbit anticipated, including when a former White House aide testified publicly about his behavior the day of the Capitol insurrection. Some allies had assured the former President that the last televised hearing would likely be this week, but then committee members said those plans shifted to next week, delaying the conclusion of the hearings that Trump seeks. While often using expletives, Trump has continued to vent that no one is on the dais defending him or his actions on the day of the Capitol insurrection. He has suggested having allies, like Steve Bannon, come forward to do so. Privately, he has blasted the former White House aide, Cassidy Hutchinson, as \u201ccrazy\u201d and \u201cpsycho.\u201d During public testimony last month, Hutchinson revealed, among other things, that Trump knew protesters coming to the Capitol on January 6 were armed, and yet he wanted them to attend his rally and even join them at the Capitol. Here's what the January 6 committee has revealed through its 6 hearings And Trump has railed against Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the two Republicans on the committee, on a daily basis. But despite his irritation with who sits on the committee, Trump has been unable to look away from the hearings for long and has followed them all closely, people around him say. The committee is holding its seventh public hearing Tuesday afternoon, with the panel planning to show how right-wing extremist groups, including the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, prepared to attack the Capitol in the days leading up to January 6 \u2013 and the groups\u2019 ties to Trump associates, including Roger Stone and Michael Flynn, according to committee aides. Last week, Bannon, who defied a congressional subpoena and is set to go to trial on criminal contempt charges, told the committee that he is now willing to testify, ideally at a public hearing, according to a letter obtained by CNN. His offer came after he received a letter from Trump waiving executive privilege, although both the committee and federal prosecutors contend that privilege claim never gave Bannon carte blanche to ignore a congressional subpoena in the first place. However, Bannon\u2019s potential testimony might do little to assuage Trump\u2019s desire for a public defender. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who sits on the January 6 panel, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that public testimony from Bannon was unlikely, noting that the committee typically does depositions. \u201cThis goes on for hour after hour after hour. We want to get all our questions answered, and you can\u2019t do that in a live format,\u201d Lofgren said. The committee was interested in speaking to Bannon about his communications with Trump in December 2020, when Bannon reportedly urged him to focus on the January 6 certification of the presidential election results. Committee members were also interested in Bannon\u2019s comments in the run-up to the Capitol insurrection, including a podcast on January 5, in which he predicted, \u201cAll hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d Some people close to Trump think former White House counsel Pat Cipollone should not have agreed to testify before the House select committee and are uneasy about what he told the panel ahead of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, a Trump world source told CNN. The former President\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., attacked Cipollone on Twitter last weekend for letting \u201cthe Left bully\u201d him into \u201csitting quietly,\u201d referring to Cipollone\u2019s closed-door deposition with the committee on Friday. Cipollone\u2019s deposition was on video and clips from it were aired during Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cStop hiding in the background, Pat. Grow a spine & go on record,\u201d Trump Jr. tweeted. Two sources said that there is hope among some Trump allies that Cipollone will respect executive privilege, but did not go into detail as to what exactly would fall under privilege. Cipollone invoked executive privilege during his interview with the committee despite the panel\u2019s attempts to pose questions that would not have required such a response, a person familiar with the interview previously told CNN. Some Trump allies and former staffers are concerned over what Cipollone might have said, given his omnipresence, according to one source familiar with these conversations. As CNN has reported, Cipollone was often around, sitting in both critical and more mundane meetings. Because of this, there are questions about what was actually said and by whom in front of him. The committee has interviewed several high-profile witnesses from the Trump White House but, for the most part, some sources close to the former President have sought to downplay any concern about their willingness to testify. The view of this specific source regarding Cipollone represents a noticeable shift in thinking given Cipollone\u2019s visibility on a host of potentially problematic issues for Trump and his allies. And those issues are not only pertinent to the committee\u2019s investigation but could overlap with ongoing criminal investigations that have intensified in recent weeks and increasingly threaten to ensnare the former President and those around him.

            "article_content": "Whether or not Donald Trump ends up facing criminal charges, the House committee probing the US Capitol insurrection has scored a critical win over the ex-President by thwarting his effort to cover up the true horror of that day of infamy. The committee takes center stage in Washington again this week with its Tuesday televised hearing amid indications it will seek to make a direct connection between Trump and the far-right extremists who helped rioters smash their way into the halls of Congress on January 6, 2021. This comes after the committee landed telling blows last week by securing testimony behind closed doors from ex-White House counsel Pat Cipollone and as Trump lifted his questionable executive privilege claim covering former aide Steve Bannon. It was revealed on Monday that Trump\u2019s attorney, Justin Clark, spoke to the FBI two weeks ago. The January 6 insurrection: Minute-by-minute Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the panel, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that excerpts of videotaped testimony from Cipollone \u2013 who was at or near Trump\u2019s side in the West Wing and, according to other witnesses, pushed back on his lawless instincts \u2013 would feature as the committee plans at least one hearing this week. \u201cHe was able to provide information on basically all of the critical issues that we\u2019re looking at, and including the President\u2019s, what I would call, dereliction of duty on the day of January 6,\u201d Lofgren said referring to Friday\u2019s testimony. A source familiar with Cipollone\u2019s interview told CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown that that the former White House counsel, testifying under a subpoena, did invoke executive privilege on some questions \u2013 to shield certain information or conversations with the then-President from Congress under the separation of powers doctrine. Lofgren also said that the committee would likely hear from Bannon, who is set to face trial later this month over his refusal to submit to a subpoena on the grounds that he was covered by executive privilege. This claim is seen as spurious by many legal observers since Bannon had long departed his role as a White House adviser by the time of the 2020 election. Bannon is now willing to testify, ideally in a public hearing, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Such a platform could allow him to mount the kind of high-profile, inflammatory defense of Trump that the ex-President adores but that has been lacking from the committee\u2019s televised hearings. Lofgren indicated on CNN that such a forum was unlikely. Steve Bannon says he's willing to testify before January 6 committee after Trump waives claims of executive privilege Trump has sought to block and discredit the committee at every turn. His supporters in Congress squelched a drive for an independent commission and key aides, as well as Bannon, have refused to honor subpoenas. But that has not stopped the panel from creating a picture of behavior by the ex-President that is even more disturbing than video and public evidence that was previously available. As it enters the probable endgame of its investigation, the committee is gathering momentum and whipping up a serious debate over a question with staggering implications: should an ex-President of the United States be charged for alleged crimes against the Constitution that occurred when he was in office? Through witnesses who were around Trump, hauls of text messages, interviews with key players and even family members of the ex-President, the committee has built a damning case about his insurrectionist behavior. Ty Cobb, a former Trump White House lawyer, told CNN on Thursday that the results of the hearings so far show that Trump deserved to be blamed for his role on January 6, 2021, that the committee had uncovered \u201cserious facts\u201d that concerned him greatly and that charges could be a possibility. \u201cIt depends on the crime,\u201d Cobb told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cThere is anything from seditious conspiracy to attempting to influence a witness,\u201d Cobb said. But he cautioned: \u201cI think the Justice Department has a weighty decision to make about prosecuting former presidents. While that is routine, it seems, in South America, the United States has not seen that. And it will be a significant policy decision.\u201d Ex-Trump White House lawyer weighs if Trump should be criminally charged Larry Hogan, the term-limited Republican governor of Maryland who is often mentioned as a long-shot alternative to Trump in the 2024 primary, was asked on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday whether the country could handle the indictment of a former President. \u201cI\u2019m not sure they can,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cBut I think no man is above the law, so if that\u2019s where the facts lead, that\u2019s what has to happen,\u201d Hogan said. The committee can for now do nothing more than flesh out its case. And this week it will seek to prove that the ex-President was derelict in his duty to defend the democratic system, while he attacked it. Kinzinger told ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday that another upcoming hearing would be \u201cvery important.\u201d \u201cPay attention, because I think it goes to the heart of what is the oath of a leader,\u201d the Illinois Republican said. \u201cYou can\u2019t selectively pick what parts of the Constitution you defend or what branches of government, and you certainly can\u2019t be gleeful during that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon \u2013 who defied a congressional subpoena and is set to go to trial on criminal contempt charges \u2013 told the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection on Saturday that he is now willing to testify, ideally at a public hearing, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Bannon\u2019s reversal comes after he received a letter from former President Donald Trump waiving executive privilege, although both the House select committee and federal prosecutors contend that privilege claim never gave Bannon carte blanche to ignore a congressional subpoena in the first place. \u201cWhen you first received the Subpoena to testify and provide documents, I invoked Executive Privilege. However, I watched how unfairly you and others have been treated, having to spend vast amounts of money on legal fees, and all of the trauma you must be going through for the love of your Country, and out of respect for the Office of the President,\u201d Trump wrote in a Saturday letter to Bannon, which was also obtained by CNN. Bannon and DOJ don't want to talk politics or January 6 specifics at contempt trial \u201cTherefore, if you reach an agreement on a time and place for your testimony, I will waive Executive Privilege for you, which allows you to go in and testify truthfully and fairly\u201d Trump added, as he went on to decry the committee of \u201cThugs and Hacks.\u201d The letters were first reported by The Guardian. Bannon was charged last year with two counts of criminal contempt of Congress. He has argued that he was free to ignore his congressional subpoena in order to protect Trump\u2019s potential privilege claims. But federal prosecutors and other legal experts have argued that privilege does not apply to Bannon \u2013 who left his White House gig as chief strategist years before the Capitol riot \u2013 and did not give him the authority to refuse to provide any documents or testimony to the committee. Bannon\u2019s team provided Trump\u2019s new letter to the January 6 committee overnight, along with a letter from Bannon lawyer Bob Costello. \u201cWhile Mr. Bannon has been steadfast in his convictions, circumstances have now changed,\u201d Costello wrote. \u201cMr. Bannon is willing to, and indeed prefers, to testify at your public hearing.\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who sits on the January 6 panel, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that the committee hasn\u2019t yet had a chance to discuss Bannon\u2019s letter, but that \u201cI expect that we will be hearing from him and there are many questions that we have for him.\u201d Lofgren, however, said that public testimony from Bannon was unlikely, noting that the committee typically does depositions. \u201cThis goes on for hour after hour after hour. We want to get all our questions answered, and you can\u2019t do that in a live format,\u201d she said. The January 6 committee was interested in speaking to Bannon about his communications with Trump in December 2020, when Bannon reportedly urged him to focus on the January 6 certification of the presidential election results. Committee members were also interested in Bannon\u2019s comments in the run-up to the Capitol insurrection, including a podcast on January 5, in which he predicted, \u201cAll hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d In a Monday court filing, federal prosecutors called Bannon\u2019s willingness to now testify before the House select committee a \u201clast-minute\u201d effort that doesn\u2019t change the case against him, pointing out that he has not produced subpoenaed records. \u201cThe Defendant\u2019s last-minute efforts to testify almost nine months after his default \u2014 he has still made no effort to produce records \u2014 are irrelevant to whether he willfully refused to comply in October 2021 with the Select Committee\u2019s subpoena,\u201d prosecutors wrote. Bannon is currently set to go to trial on July 18. \u201cThe criminal contempt statute is not intended to procure compliance; it is intended to punish past noncompliance,\u201d prosecutors wrote in their filing. A spokesperson for the committee did not immediately respond to a request for comment. This story has been updated with additional developments and reaction.

If the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol has taught us anything, it\u2019s that our understanding of that day is far from settled. While much of the country watched the insurrection in real-time one and a half years ago on live television, the panel\u2019s public hearings have delivered critical context to the circumstances around it. Here\u2019s the latest. Members of the panel previewed on Sunday their next public hearing, on Tuesday at 1 p.m. ET, which will zero in on how the violent mob came together and the role of extremist groups in the deadly insurrection. The hearing will be led by Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin of Maryland and Stephanie Murphy of Florida, CNN has learned. Connecting the dots. \u201cWe are going to be connecting the dots during these hearings between these groups and those who were trying \u2013 in government circles \u2013 to overturn the election. So, we do think that this story is unfolding in a way that is very serious and quite credible,\u201d Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California said of Tuesday\u2019s hearing and another that hasn\u2019t been scheduled in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d The January 6 insurrection: Minute-by-minute CNN confirmed Sunday evening that Jason Van Tatenhove, a former spokesperson and self-described \u201cpropagandist\u201d for the Oath Keepers, is expected to testify at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Van Tatenhove told Colorado TV station KDVR of his invitation last week. Extreme encouragement. Murphy told NBC on Sunday that the panel could present evidence that members of Congress encouraged extremist groups to come to Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021, echoing then-President Donald Trump\u2019s tweet in December 2020 that January 6 would \u201cbe wild.\u201d She called that tweet a \u201csiren call\u201d for those groups. Trump\u2019s tweets. Raskin told CBS that Tuesday\u2019s hearing will reveal the \u201cfundamental importance of a meeting that took place in the White House on December the 18th,\u201d after which Trump sent out the tweet asking his supporters to come to DC on January 6. A spokesperson for the select committee declined to comment on the plans for Tuesday\u2019s hearing. 1. Steve Bannon \u2013 who defied a congressional subpoena and is set to go to trial on criminal contempt charges later this month \u2013 told the House select committee on Saturday that he is now willing to testify, ideally at a public hearing, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Bannon\u2019s reversal comes after he received a letter from Trump waiving executive privilege, although both the House select committee and federal prosecutors contend that privilege claim never gave Bannon carte blanche to ignore a congressional subpoena in the first place. 2. Three sources familiar with former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone\u2019s testimony to the panel behind closed doors on Friday characterized it as very important and extremely helpful and told CNN it will become evident in upcoming public committee hearings. \u201cIn our interview with Mr. Cipollone, the Committee received critical testimony on nearly every major topic in its investigation, reinforcing key points regarding Donald Trump\u2019s misconduct and providing highly relevant new information that will play a central role in its upcoming hearings. This includes information demonstrating Donald Trump\u2019s supreme dereliction of duty. The testimony also corroborated key elements of Cassidy Hutchinson\u2019s testimony,\u201d committee spokesperson Tim Mulvey said. Lofgren told CNN on Sunday, \u201cWe will have some excerpts of Mr. Cipollone\u2019s testimony\u201d at upcoming hearings. \u201cHe was able to provide information on basically all of the critical issues that we\u2019re looking at,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone invoked executive privilege in his closed-door interview Friday with the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol despite the panel\u2019s attempts to pose questions that would not have required such a response, according to a person familiar with the interview. Cipollone, who had previously expressed concerns to the committee about interview questions that might have required him to invoke executive privilege, testified before the committee Friday under a subpoena. A House select committee spokesperson told CNN the panel\u2019s interview with Cipollone was productive but said there was no agreement made to restrict any questions to avoid potential issues with executive privilege. Jan. 6 panel didn't specifically ask Cipollone about Hutchinson's testimony on legal consequences of going to Capitol during riot, sources say \u201cIn our interview with Mr. Cipollone, the Committee received critical testimony on nearly every major topic in its investigation, reinforcing key points regarding Donald Trump\u2019s misconduct and providing highly relevant new information that will play a central role in its upcoming hearings. This includes information demonstrating Donald Trump\u2019s supreme dereliction of duty. The testimony also corroborated key elements of Cassidy Hutchinson\u2019s testimony. Allegations of some pre-interview agreement to limit Cipillone\u2019s testimony are completely false,\u201d committee spokesperson Tim Mulvey said. Hutchinson, who was an aide to former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, testified before the January 6 committee last month in a blockbuster hearing in which she described her experience at the White House as someone close to then-President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle in the days leading up to and including the Capitol Hill riot. The select committee on Friday also asked Cipollone a series of questions about pardons, including potential pardons for the Trump family and whether Trump wanted to pardon himself, the person familiar said. Cipollone told the committee that he didn\u2019t believe the 2020 election was stolen but that he thinks Trump did and still does hold that belief, according to the source. The committee also questioned Cipollone about the pressure campaign toward then-Vice President Mike Pence around his ability to potentially not certify the 2020 election results while presiding over the joint session of Congress on January 6, the source said. Earlier Friday, three different sources familiar with Cipollone\u2019s testimony characterized it as very important and extremely helpful and told CNN it will become evident in upcoming public committee hearings. The interview was recorded on video and could be featured at upcoming hearings, including one on Tuesday that will focus on how the violent mob came together and the role of extremist groups, as well as another hearing \u2013 which hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled \u2013 on the 187 minutes of Trump\u2019s inaction as rioters stormed the US Capitol.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection has concluded its closed-door interview Friday with Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone during which it had been expected to ask about what he witnessed in the waning days of Donald Trump\u2019s administration when the former President and his allies tried to overturn the election. The interview was recorded on video and could be featured at upcoming hearings, including one on Tuesday about how the violent mob came together and the role of extremist groups, as well as another hearing \u2013 which hasn\u2019t yet been scheduled \u2013 on the 187 minutes of Trump\u2019s inaction as rioters stormed the US Capitol. Cipollone met with the committee for nearly eight hours on Friday. He did not answer questions from CNN when entering or exiting the room. Cipollone took 70 minutes\u2019 worth of breaks from the interview with his counsel in a separate conference room throughout the day. His appearance Friday is the result of months of negotiations between his lawyers and the January 6 panel about what topics can be discussed. He had previously met with the committee informally in April. Cipollone was among the handful of people who spent time with Trump as he watched the Capitol riot unfold on television from a dining room off the Oval Office, according to two sources familiar with the panel\u2019s investigation. The committee has heard from other witnesses who said Cipollone, along with other senior Trump advisers, including Ivanka Trump and Dan Scavino, were with the President at various points during this time. Like others who were present and have testified before the committee, Cipollone could help shed light on Trump\u2019s state of mind as the violence was taking place. Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, for example, testified that she heard a conversation in the dining room at one point about rioters chanting \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Cipollone\u2019s presence in the dining room \u2013 which several witnesses have described to the committee \u2013 underscores why the committee is seeking his on-the-record testimony as a key fact witness. California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat on the committee, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Friday that in his testimony, Cipollone \u201cdid not contradict the testimony of other witnesses, and I think we did learn a few things which we will be rolling out in hearings to come.\u201d When asked specifically if Cipollone confirmed testimony from Hutchinson, Lofgren said, \u201cnot contradicting is not the same as confirming.\u201d Pressed on the difference, Lofgren said, \u201cWell, he could say so and so was wrong \u2013  which he did not say. There were things that he might not be present for or in some cases, couldn\u2019t recall with precision. \u201cI think he was candid with the committee. He was careful in his answers, and I believe that he was honest in his answers,\u201d she added. Cipollone\u2019s concerns about executive privilege surrounding the role of the White House counsel could lead to him limiting his cooperation with the committee, according to sources familiar with his thinking. The committee has sought to piece together a comprehensive account of what Trump was doing on January 6, whom he talked to and how he reacted to the violence in real time. The panel has been leaning heavily on witness testimony to do so because of an hours-long gap in White House records during that time period, CNN previously reported. Lofgren, pushed back on the claims of privilege Cipollone could assert saying on CNN earlier this week. \u201cWell, executive privilege is held by the current President, who has not asserted it when it comes to finding out information about the January 6th plot,\u201d Lofgren said. \u201cThe attorney-client privilege could be asserted. But, remember, the presidency is his client, not Mr. Trump as a person.\u201d But Lofgren affirmed, \u201cI\u2019m sure we will get information that\u2019s of use to him and we will also respect his dedication to these principals that he holds dear.\u201d 5 takeaways from the fifth day of January 6 hearings Cipollone\u2019s name has repeatedly come up during the committee\u2019s hearings so far as he is viewed as a key witness by the committee. Cipollone was in a key oval office meeting on January 3, 2021, when Trump was considering replacing Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen with DOJ environmental lawyer Jeffrey Clark, because Clark, unlike Rosen, was willing to use the powers of federal law enforcement to back his baseless claims of election fraud. In that meeting, Rosen and Cipollone discredited Clark\u2019s credentials for the job and categorically dismissed a draft letter Clark had written that falsely claimed the Department of Justice had found evidence of election fraud. Rosen\u2019s deputy Richard Donoghue testified in a committee hearing that Cipollone said of the drafted letter in that meeting, \u201cthat letter that this guy wants to send, that letter is a murder-suicide pact. It\u2019s going to damage everyone who touches it. And we should have nothing to do with that letter. I don\u2019t ever want to see that letter again.\u201d The committee has revealed that in its previous, informal conversation with Cipollone, Cipollone told the select committee that \u201che intervened when he heard Mr. Clark was meeting with the president about legal matters without his knowledge, which was strictly against White House policy.\u201d Hutchinson testified that Cipollone was against Trump calling on his supporters to march to the Capitol in his speech in the morning of January 6 and was particularly against Trump joining his supporters at the Capitol. Hutchinson said that Cipollone told her on January 3, \u201cWe need to make sure that this doesn\u2019t happen, this would be legally a terrible idea for us. We have serious legal concerns if we go to the Capitol that day.\u201d When the violence broke out at the Capitol, Cipollone marched into the office of Trump\u2019s former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, according to Hutchinson, and demanded they talk to Trump about doing something to intervene. Jan. 6 committee gets its most important witness yet as Trump White House counsel testifies Hutchinson testified that Meadows told Cipollone that the former President did not want to do anything and Cipollone said something to the effect of Mark, \u2018something needs to be done, or people are going to die, the blood\u2019s going to be on your f***ing hands.\u2019 Cipollone wanted Trump to say in his January 7, 2021, speech that the rioters should be prosecuted and described as violent, but Hutchinson said those original lines did not make it into the final version of the speech Trump delivered. Hutchinson added that from what she understood at the time, the reason individuals like Cipollone wanted that language in there was because there was a \u201clarge concern of 25th amendment potentially being invoked.\u201d The committee has played video of testimony from Jared Kushner saying that Cipollone and his team \u201cwere always saying, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re going to resign. We\u2019re not going to be here if this happens, if that happens.\u2019\u201d But Kushner said, \u201cI kind of took it up to just be whining to be honest with you.\u201d Prior to Cipollone\u2019s interview being set, the committee had made a public push to get him to testify under oath. \u201cOur Committee is certain that Donald Trump does not want Mr. Cipollone to testify here,\u201d said GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who serves as vice chairwoman of the committee, at the close the panel\u2019s fourth hearing on June 21. \u201cWe think the American people deserve to hear from Mr. Cipollone personally,\u201d she added. \u201cHe should appear before this Committee, and we are working to secure his testimony.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Friday.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the US Capitol insurrection on Friday could land some of its most critical testimony yet \u2013 from former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who was present for some of the most fraught moments in Donald Trump\u2019s West Wing. The committee hopes Cipollone can provide insider details about what went on among key officials on January 6, 2021, when Trump refused to call off his mob as lawmakers ran for their lives. His testimony, video-taped and behind closed doors, could flesh out Trump\u2019s scheme in key states to steal the 2020 election and may play a key role in a looming decision by the committee on whether to recommend a criminal prosecution of Trump to the Justice Department. \u201cWe just want the truth,\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who sits on the committee, told CNN on Wednesday. Justice Department closes in on documents subpoenaed from GOP operatives connected to Trump fake electors plan \u201cWe learned quite a bit about things that Mr. Cipollone said and did from multiple other witnesses but there are some things that we would like to hear from him directly.\u201d Cipollone may be able to corroborate blockbuster testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, an ex-aide to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The 26-year-old told the committee in a dramatic hearing last month that Cipollone had said there would be \u201cserious legal concerns\u201d if Trump went up to the Capitol as Congress was certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s election win. Hutchinson also said Cipollone warned that those around Trump could get charged with \u201cevery crime imaginable\u201d if they allowed the ex-President to join the mob on Capitol Hill. She testified that as the riot escalated Cipollone bluntly told Meadows that \u201csomething needs to be done or people are going to die and the blood\u2019s going to be on your f**king hands.\u201d Trump\u2019s son-in-law and former senior White House adviser, Jared Kushner, meanwhile, said in video testimony to the committee that Cipollone and those around him often threatened to resign. Kushner, however, said he considered such threats simply \u201cwhining.\u201d Cipollone\u2019s interview follows weeks of building drama around the committee, which is cranking up the heat in a series of televised hearings that have revealed damaging new evidence about Trump\u2019s multi-front attempt to tarnish the 2020 election and heightened questions about whether he should face criminal repercussions. The committee has secured testimony that Trump knew his mob was armed on January 6 but goaded it to march on Capitol Hill anyway. It has shown the painful human price paid by election observers whom Trump viciously and falsely accused of vote counting fraud. And multiple witnesses testified that the ex-President was repeatedly told he lost the election but refused to end his effort to remain in power and prevent Biden from taking office. 11 key points from 6 insurrection hearings Following Hutchinson\u2019s appearance, members of the committee piled even more pressure on Cipollone to testify. The former White House counsel will appear under subpoena for a transcribed interview on video, sources told CNN. The questions will be limited to specific topics to get around executive privilege concerns relating to his direct interactions with Trump, sources said. But the former President is already showing signs of anxiety ahead of Cipollone\u2019s appearance, and given Hutchinson\u2019s testimony, it is difficult to see how his testimony will do anything to mitigate what is emerging as a damning picture of Trump\u2019s behavior. He wrote on his Truth Social network on Wednesday that the appearance by Cipollone was \u201cso bad for the USA!\u201d and could prevent future presidents from having \u201ccandid and important\u201d conversations with their White House counsels. As was often the case when he was in office, Trump appears to be viewing Cipollone as a personal lawyer rather than the lawyer for the presidency who owes an allegiance to the Constitution. Trump may be right to be concerned, even though Cipollone will be a reluctant witness to the committee and had to be subpoenaed. Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told CNN on Wednesday that \u201cPat will tell the truth, there is no question about that.\u201d While Friday\u2019s testimony will be in private, the committee has made a practice of using clips from witness interviews. So it\u2019s possible that Americans could see parts of what he says on Friday, possibly as soon as next week when televised hearings resume. In a letter to Cipollone accompanying its subpoena, House select committee Chair Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and vice chair Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, told Cipollone that the inquiry had obtained significant evidence since he sat for an informal interview with the committee on April 13 about which he was \u201cuniquely positioned\u201d to testify. They said in a statement that \u201cany concerns Mr. Cipollone has about the institutional prerogatives of the office he previously held are clearly outweighed by the need for his testimony.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jason Crow of Colorado, who was in opposition to Cipollone when both took part in the ex-President\u2019s first impeachment trial, told CNN Thursday that the ex-White House counsel was a critical witness. \u201cIn a lot of these discussions, there was Pat Cipollone. This is somebody who knows what the President was thinking, who he was talking to, what he was saying,\u201d Crow said on \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d on Thursday. Former Attorney General William Barr, for example, told the committee in his testimony that Cipollone was with him and Trump in the Oval Office when the then-President erupted over Barr\u2019s interview with the Associated Press in which he had said there was no evidence of widespread electoral fraud in the 2020 presidential election. \u201cI went up to Pat Cipollone\u2019s office and we were talking with each other,\u201d Barr said in video testimony played by the committee. \u201cAnd word came down that he wanted us both to go to the Oval, and the President was as mad as I\u2019ve ever seen him.\u201d Cipollone\u2019s interview before the committee is drawing some comparisons to the case of former White House counsel John Dean, who testified to the Senate Watergate Committee and blew the lid off the conspiracy that led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. Dean said on Thursday that the parallel was not exact since he was a willing witness. But Cipollone could still play a powerful role, he said. \u201cI was trying to end a coverup that was ongoing,\u201d Dean told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt. \u201cPat Cipollone is coming from a very different place,\u201d Dean said, but added: \u201cIf he goes in front of the committee and tells what he knows, he can be a very important witness.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump White House Counsel Pat Cipollone has reached a deal with the January 6 committee to participate in a transcribed interview behind closed doors on Friday, multiple sources told CNN. Cipollone will be appearing under subpoena. A source familiar with his thinking says Cipollone intended to comply with the subpoena issued on June 29 for a July 6 interview, and it was extended until July 8. The interview will be on video, two of the sources told CNN. Cipollone, who many former administration officials credit with helping to prevent then-President Donald Trump from taking legally questionable actions in the months around the 2020 presidential election, has long been considered a key witness by the committee. He has resisted talking further with the committee after previously sitting for a closed-door interview on April 13. The New York Times first reported that Cipollone would testify behind close doors Friday. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment. CNN has previously reported ahead of the interview being set that the topics would limited to specific topics to avoid privilege issues, a lawyer familiar with Cipollone\u2019s thinking has told CNN. The committee said in its subpoena letter that it has obtained evidence that Cipollone is \u201cuniquely positioned to testify,\u201d but he had \u201cdeclined to cooperate\u201d past that interview, leaving the panel with \u201cno choice\u201d but to issue the subpoena. During recent public hearings, members of the panel publicly pressured Cipollone to testify. Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, the panel\u2019s chairman, and Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the panel\u2019s vice chairwoman, said in a statement after issuing the subpoena that \u201cthe Select Committee\u2019s investigation has revealed evidence that Mr. Cipollone repeatedly raised legal and other concerns about President Trump\u2019s activities on January 6 and in the days that preceded.\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who\u2019s also a member of the committee, previously told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on \u201cAC360\u201d that the panel was willing to work through privilege issues with Cipollone to facilitate his testimony. Lofgren said there are \u201cquite a few things that he could tell the committee that would not be subject to privilege.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "Cassidy Hutchinson\u2019s testimony before the House select committee this week increased the criminal exposure former President Donald Trump faces in the Justice Department\u2019s ongoing January 6, 2021, investigation. Anecdotes recounted under oath by the former White House aide offer new avenues for investigators to potentially examine whether Trump tried to obstruct, conspired against or attempted to defraud the government, several experienced prosecutors-turned-defense attorneys told CNN on Wednesday. Ty Cobb, who represented Trump in the White House during Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, said this situation is much different than with Mueller. At the time of the Mueller investigation, Cobb believed Trump shouldn\u2019t be charged with any crime \u2013 and the President wasn\u2019t. Nor did Cobb believe Mueller\u2019s investigation was warranted. Now, that is not the case. \u201cHere there are many damning facts,\u201d said Cobb, who pointed to Hutchinson\u2019s testimony that Trump knew his supporters were armed on January 6, riled them up, then appeared to concur with them chanting to hang the vice president as worthy of prosecutors\u2019 attention. January 6 committee subpoenas Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone for testimony If that \u201cisn\u2019t insurrection, I don\u2019t know what is,\u201d he said Wednesday. Legal experts have long viewed the US Capitol attack as one that could theoretically prompt an investigation into the Trump-era White House, even though any investigation around the presidency raises complicated issues. So far, more than 800 rioters have been criminally charged \u2013 with a third of them admitting their guilt in federal court. In recent months, the Justice Department investigation has broadened beyond the rioters, moving closer to the political circles around Trump. Investigators have gathered communications and other information from fake electors the Trump campaign organized in seven battleground states he lost, from a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally organizer, from former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark \u2013 whom Trump wanted to install as attorney general in early January 2021\u2013 and from John Eastman, Trump\u2019s election lawyer who wanted to block Congress from certifying his loss of the presidency. The committee has raised allegations of other potential charges, including possible witness tampering and related to Trump\u2019s post-election fundraising. Now, federal investigators may seek to corroborate evidence the House has presented. That may include vetting Hutchinson\u2019s testimony with other witness who could speak to what Trump knew about the potential for violence on Capitol Hill and that his wish to stop Congress could be illegal. \u201cI think we crossed two important thresholds\u201d for the consideration of charges when evaluating Hutchinson\u2019s testimony, said Elie Honig, CNN senior legal analyst and a former federal prosecutor, on \u201cDon Lemon Tonight\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cOne is the violence threshold, the direct link to Donald Trump that that crowd was armed. And the other is intent. Remember early on, when the big question, the big point of dispute was, Did Donald Trump know at the time what that crowd was going to do? Did he want them to remain peaceful or did he want them to go into that Capitol angry? I mean, is there really any question about that anymore?\u201d Criminal investigators would have wider latitude than the House to access evidence and to interview witnesses, including some who\u2019ve been recalcitrant toward the House. That power of federal grand juries to obtain testimony and evidence dates back to Watergate, when a federal judge allowed prosecutors access to Nixon White House tapes. \u201cI think everything is on the table, and this January 6 committee has done a pretty good job of showing the road map and the possibilities that existed,\u201d Doug Jones, the former federal prosecutor and former Democratic US senator from Alabama, said on Wednesday. \u201cWe have never seen anything like this in this country. Watergate pales in comparison.\u201d First on CNN: Cassidy Hutchinson stands by her testimony amid pushback Even if the DOJ has a case to bring, the department would face significant policy decisions, including weighing the enormous consequences of bringing criminal charges against a former President for actions he took while in office. \u201cThere\u2019s a piece of this that scares the hell out of me,\u201d Jones said, adding: \u201cWe have already seen in the Congress of the United States this idea that every party wants to impeach the opposing President of the other party.\u201d \u201cI worry we are at a point in this country that we are going to see every former administration that every former administration will be investigated criminally on anything like this in the country.\u201d Cobb, too, cautioned the type of hyper-partisan political era that charging a former President might bring \u2013 saying it could be \u201cone more step in the erosion of our institutions.\u201d \u201cI am not convinced prosecuting Trump is in the best interests of the country in the long term,\u201d Cobb said. After weighing the evidence, lawyers within the Office of Legal Counsel and other top levels of the Justice Department would need to analyze constitutional hypotheticals, past internal decisions and court precedents. \u201cHow will this impact the future of the presidency? That\u2019s the question they always ask,\u201d said Neil Eggleston, the former White House counsel in the Obama administration. \u201cHow would a prosecution of President Trump impact the future presidency? I think those are the issues they\u2019ll be thinking about. I think they will conclude they have no impact on the future presidency.\u201d There\u2019s also the matter of free speech and political speech protections, and other defenses Trump has raised already in civil cases seeking to hold him liable for January 6. A federal judge in Washington, DC, has already looked at the possibility of the President taking part in a conspiracy, in a civil context. Judge Amit Mehta found it was plausible. \u201cThe President\u2019s January 6 Rally Speech can reasonably be viewed as a call for collective action,\u201d Mehta wrote in response to accusations brought by Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California and others. A lawyer who brought the civil conspiracy case last year said Hutchinson\u2019s testimony this week strengthened the conspiracy argument. \u201cThere was so much more detail about what Trump knew,\u201d said Philip Andonian, who brought Swalwell\u2019s lawsuit against Trump. Former Trump campaign CFO testifies to January 6 committee Trump has appealed Mehta\u2019s ruling, arguing to an appeals court he has absolute immunity, for everything he said and did while President. Courts have previously found the privilege protections around the presidency melt away if there was criminal action. And another judge, in a California federal court, also determined this year that Trump \u201cmore likely than not\u201d engaged in the planning of a crime with his attorney Eastman, wiping away the confidentiality of some Trump-side attorney-client communications after the election. \u201cIf the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself,\u201d the judge, David O. Carter, wrote, releasing some of Eastman\u2019s emails related to his efforts for Trump to the House select committee. Some legal scholars also say that Trump may argue he genuinely believed that the election was stolen from him, and that this good-faith belief motivated his actions to stop the transfer of power. Experts have said former Attorney General William Barr may have bolstered Trump\u2019s defense by testifying that Trump was \u201cdetached from reality\u201d regarding the 2020 election. But that argument might only get Trump so far. \u201cYou can have a good-faith belief that the earth is flat, but it doesn\u2019t allow you to act in a criminal way,\u201d said Michael Zeldin, another former federal prosecutor and former CNN analyst. \u201cYou can have a good-faith belief that you really won an election, but it wouldn\u2019t give you the right to shoot senators who said that you lost.\u201d CNN\u2019s Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack has issued a subpoena to compel testimony from Pat Cipollone, former President Donald Trump\u2019s White House counsel. Cipollone, who many former administration officials credit with helping to prevent Trump from taking legally questionable actions in the months around the 2020 presidential election, has long been considered a key witness by the committee. He has resisted talking further with the committee after previously sitting for a closed-door interview on April 13. The committee said in its subpoena letter that it has obtained evidence that Cipollone is \u201cuniquely positioned to testify\u201d but he has \u201cdeclined to cooperate\u201d past that interview, leaving the panel with \u201cno choice\u201d but to issue the subpoena. During recent public hearings, members of the panel have publicly pressured Cipollone to testify. The committee is now taking the step to issue a subpoena in an effort to force his formal cooperation. Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, the panel\u2019s chairman, and Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the panel\u2019s vice chair, said that \u201cthe Select Committee\u2019s investigation has revealed evidence that Mr. Cipollone repeatedly raised legal and other concerns about President Trump\u2019s activities on January 6th and in the days that preceded.\u201d Former Trump campaign CFO testifies to January 6 committee \u201cWhile the Select Committee appreciates Mr. Cipollone\u2019s earlier informal engagement with our investigation, the committee needs to hear from him on the record, as other former White House counsels have done in other congressional investigations,\u201d the pair continued. \u201cAny concerns Mr. Cipollone has about the institutional prerogatives of the office he previously held are clearly outweighed by the need for his testimony.\u201d Cipollone will probably agree to a transcribed interview with the January 6 committee \u2013 limited to specific topics to avoid the privilege issues, a lawyer familiar with his thinking told CNN. Whether any testimony would be taped or live would also need to be worked out. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who\u2019s also a member of the committee, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on \u201cAC360\u201d on Wednesday that the panel is willing to work through privilege issues with Cipollone to facilitate his testimony. \u201cI hope that he does comply,\u201d she said. \u201cWe recognize that there could be some communication between him and the president that is legitimately privileged, and we\u2019re willing to work through those.\u201d Lofgren said there are \u201cquite a few things that he could tell the committee that would not be subject to privilege.\u201d Witnesses who have testified before the panel have repeatedly mentioned Cipollone as someone who can shed light on key events inside the Trump White House leading up to, on and after January 6, 2021. Not long after the rioters broke into the US Capitol, Cipollone rushed into then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows\u2019 office demanding a meeting with Trump, Meadows aide Cassidy Hutchinson told the January 6 committee this week. \u201cI remember Pat saying to him something to the effect of, \u2018the rioters have gotten to the Capitol. We need to go down and see the President now,\u2019\u201d Hutchinson said in a videotaped interview. \u201cAnd Mark looked up at him and said, \u2018He doesn\u2019t want to do anything, Pat,\u2019\u201d she said. Cipollone, Hutchinson added, emphasized to Meadows the need for action to control the situation to Meadows. She said Cipollone \u201cvery clearly said this to Mark \u2013 something to the effect of, \u2018Mark, something needs to be done or people are going to die and the blood\u2019s going to be on your f**king hands. This is getting out of control. I\u2019m going down there.\u2019\u201d Meadows then handed his phones to Hutchinson and walked out of his office with Cipollone, Hutchinson told the committee. Cheney tweeted Wednesday before the subpoena was announced that \u201cas we heard yesterday, WH counsel Pat Cipollone had significant concerns re. Trump\u2019s Jan 6 activities. It\u2019s time for Mr. Cipollone to testify on the record. Any concerns he has about the institutional interests of his prior office are outweighed by the need for his testimony.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

            "article_content": "Former Trump White House trade adviser Peter Navarro pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress charges on Friday after not cooperating with the House\u2019s ongoing January 6 investigation. Navarro is charged with contempt of Congress after failing to appear for testimony or turn over documents in the House select committee\u2019s investigation. While he did not testify, he has done many media appearances and written a book, frequently talking about his conversations with former President Donald Trump and his interest in blocking Trump\u2019s election loss in 2020. Navarro has another book coming out in September \u2013 and his attorney in court on Friday tried to push his legal proceedings until after his book tour, saying the book was important to him and for his income. The judge, Amit Mehta of the DC District Court, scheduled the trial to begin in mid-November. If convicted, he would face a mandatory minimum jail sentence of one month. His case is the second criminal contempt case behind a similar set of charges the Justice Department has brought against Steve Bannon, another Trump adviser who failed to testify in the House probe. Hear Trump's own officials reject his election claims Bannon\u2019s case is headed to trial next month \u2013 and he\u2019s tried to claim the executive privilege surrounding the presidency should shield him from prosecution. Bannon did not work in the administration in 2020 or 2021, while Navarro did, but Navarro\u2019s defense may face similar hurdles as Bannon because Navarro was not one of the closest presidential advisers and has discussed Trump\u2019s post-election efforts publicly before. Navarro uncharacteristically kept his comments short when he emerged from the courthouse after his hearing Friday, though he took a moment to promote his upcoming book about post-Trump administration politics. Navarro has also now hired defense lawyers. He had complained he needed time to find a legal team after pledging to represent himself and taking issue with the FBI\u2019s approach to his arrest, which the Justice Department has defended. He declined to say how he is paying for his lawyers, after complaining last week he would be \u201ceating dog food\u201d because of the expense of fighting his charges. His attorney, John Rowley, announced he is dropping a separate civil challenge to House subpoenas and a grand jury subpoena, which Navarro brought before he had lawyers\u2019 help. Mehta had noted in court many of the legal issues raised there could be handled in his criminal proceedings. Navarro\u2019s attorneys indicated in court on Friday they are closely watching the Bannon case. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol insurrection is still trying to nail down a witness list for an upcoming hearing about former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to use the Justice Department to help support his false election fraud claims, according to sources familiar with the matter. The hearing, which had been scheduled for Wednesday but was postponed until next week, would feature former top Trump administration legal officials who stood up to the former president\u2019s pressure. Former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue are expected to appear. But the committee is striking out with Pat Cipollone, Trump\u2019s White House counsel, who many former Trump administration officials credit with helping prevent Trump from taking even more legally questionable actions in the months around the election. Sources say Cipollone is not expected to join the in-person testimony. He previously appeared for a closed-door interview with the committee. Sources say the committee also may have to do without another former top Justice Department official they had planned to join the hearing next week: Steve Engel, who headed the Office of Legal Counsel. Engel was a key witness at a pivotal January 3 meeting at the White House where Trump held a reality TV-show style contest over whether to fire Rosen and install someone more amenable to run the Justice Department to support his election fraud claims. The Senate Judiciary Committee, in an earlier investigation, found Engel told Trump at the meeting that he and other top officials would resign if he fired Rosen. Cipollone would be a noteworthy hearing witness as a former White House lawyer and close aide to the former President. Engel, however, doesn\u2019t have the same status and claims of executive privilege. Representatives for Cipollone and Engel didn\u2019t comment. The House select committee declined to comment. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, closed Thursday\u2019s hearing with a plea for more witnesses to come forward to cooperate with the committee.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack is in possession of email correspondence between conservative attorney John Eastman and Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, a conservative activist who\u2019s the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a source familiar with the committee\u2019s investigation told CNN. The source who spoke with CNN would not provide details on the emails\u2019 contents or say if they were direct messages between the two or part of a larger group correspondence. The Washington Post first reported on the emails. A separate source said the emails were part of a tranche of messages provided to the committee after a federal judge ruled that Eastman\u2019s correspondence was pertinent to the committee\u2019s work investigating former President Donald Trump and efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election in the months leading up to January 6. There is some discussion about adding Thomas\u2019 role in the effort to overturn the election results to some of the committee\u2019s upcoming public hearings, but the sources cautioned that the panel\u2019s schedule is already very full and there is currently no plan. For her part, Thomas appears open to speaking with the panel should it seek an interview with her. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to clear up misconceptions. I look forward to talking to them,\u201d she told the conservative outlet The Daily Caller in an interview published Thursday. Thomas did not respond to a CNN request for comment. Attorneys for Eastman declined to comment, as did a spokesperson for the House select committee. January 6 hearing will show Trump pressure campaign on Pence 'directly contributed' to Capitol attack, committee says Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, a member of the committee, would not confirm that it was in possession of the emails but told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night that the hearings would include only content the committee thought was specific to the focus of its investigation. \u201cThe committee won\u2019t be shy about seeking additional information from people that have information relevant to the investigation,\u201d Aguilar told Cooper in response to a question about adding Thomas to the committee\u2019s hearings. \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about specifics, but these hearings are pretty well firm and locked in, and we look forward to piecing this puzzle together for the American public and sharing what we know to date,\u201d the California Democrat continued. Eastman was the architect of a pressure campaign surrounding then-Vice President Mike Pence. He argued that Pence had the legal authority to stand in the way of the certification of the election results. It was a theory Pence ultimately rejected \u2013 to the ire of Trump and his supporters. Eastman also once served as a clerk to Clarence Thomas. As previously reported by CNN, Ginni Thomas was in regular contact with then-Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows between Election Day and January 6, encouraging him to keep up the effort to overturn the election results. Thomas has repeatedly said that her political activism has nothing to do with her husband\u2019s work on the Supreme Court. January 6 committee has footage that challenges Capitol Police findings over alleged role of GOP congressman Clarence Thomas participated in Supreme Court cases related to 2020 election controversies and, in one February 2021 opinion, dissented as the full court declined to take up a challenge to Pennsylvania\u2019s mail-in voting procedures. He demonstrated support for the claim that election fraud is a threat to America. \u201cWe are fortunate that many of the cases we have seen alleged only improper rule changes, not fraud. But that observation provides only small comfort,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAn election free from strong evidence of systemic fraud is not alone sufficient for election confidence.\u201d No other justice joined his opinion. This past January, Thomas dissented alone as the court allowed the National Archives to release thousands of documents from the Trump White House to the January 6 committee, over the former President\u2019s attempt to assert executive privilege. Thomas has refused to recuse himself in 2020 election-related cases. Sources said the House select committee has contemplated making Ginni Thomas\u2019 role in the attempt to overturn the election part of its investigation, but it has yet to call her in to testify or to issue her a subpoena. Wednesday night, The New York Times reported that Eastman claimed in December 2020 that there was a \u201cheated fight\u201d among Supreme Court justices over whether to hear arguments about efforts by the then-President to overturn the 2020 election results, and another pro-Trump attorney suggested that \u201c\u2018wild\u2019 chaos\u201d on January 6 could prod the high court to take action. In an exchange on December 24, 2020, John Eastman spoke of the supposed infighting in an email to Kenneth Chesebro and Trump campaign officials, hoping it would encourage Supreme Court justices to hear an election case, the Times reported, citing two people briefed on the contents of the email. \u201cSo the odds are not based on the legal merits but an assessment of the justices\u2019 spines, and I understand that there is a heated fight underway,\u201d Eastman reportedly wrote, referencing the process of at least four justices being needed to take up a case. He added, \u201cFor those willing to do their duty, we should help them by giving them a Wisconsin cert petition to add into the mix.\u201d According to the Times, Chesebro replied, \u201codds of action before Jan. 6 will become more favorable if the justices start to fear that there will be \u2018wild\u2019 chaos on Jan. 6 unless they rule by then, either way.\u201d The exchange was part of a group of emails obtained by the House select committee investigating the riot at the US Capitol, the Times said, and it took place days after Trump himself called for a \u201cwild\u201d protest at the Ellipse near the White House on January 6, 2021, the day the electoral votes were set to be certified by Congress. CNN has not confirmed the report and it is unclear what actual insight, if any, Eastman had into deliberations among Supreme Court justices. CNN has reached out to the Supreme Court for comment, and the January 6 committee declined to comment Wednesday night. Chesebro and a lawyer for Eastman did not respond to the Times\u2019 requests for comment. In the email exchange, there was a request that the Trump campaign pay for the effort to get a case before the high court and it may have been denied, the Times also reported. Exclusive: Retired Republican judge says January 6 was 'well-developed plan' by Trump to cling to power Asked about the email exchange, Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat and member of the January 6 committee, said Thursday that the email \u201cdoes suggest that there were at least some people maneuvering in right-wing legal circles to try to push the Supreme Court into action.\u201d Raskin also told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that if there is evidence of Eastman\u2019s comments about what was happening among the Supreme Court justices, \u201cWe will report that he said that.\u201d \u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s true,\u201d Raskin cautioned. \u201cHe could have been lying about what he knew on the inside. On the other hand, perhaps he had some backchannel connection to the Supreme Court, and we want to ferret that out if that\u2019s true. To determine whether, you know, the same people who were establishing a backchannel to the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, and the domestic violent extremist movement also had a backchannel, somehow, to the Supreme Court of the United States of America.\u201d CNN\u2019s Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien will no longer appear before the House select committee\u00a0investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol on Monday due to a family emergency, the committee announced in a release. Stepien\u2019s wife went into labor, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN, which led the committee to release him from his subpoena for the day. In his place, Stepien\u2019s lawyer will appear before the committee and make a statement. Monday\u2019s hearing will focus on former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election. Stepien was at the center of Trump\u2019s orbit as he sought to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The committee will use video clips from Stepien\u2019s earlier testimony on Monday. A source familiar with the January 6 committee\u2019s plans told CNN it is \u201cdisruptive\u201d that Stepien won\u2019t testify on Monday but argued the committee will still be able to make its points. The source said the committee has been preparing for such contingencies and has been pulling such video clips for all witnesses in case an emergency arises or witnesses were unable to testify due to a Covid complication. Stepien is unique from other Trump-world witnesses who have testified before the committee because it is more difficult for Stepien to claim his testimony is protected by executive privilege since he worked for the campaign, not the White House. Stepien can speak first-hand about what the former President said about voter fraud, in his own words, compared to others, according to a source familiar with the matter. Stepien was expected to be critical of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani on Monday \u2013 testifying his role in spreading unfounded claims of voter fraud that were embraced by the former President even after he was told they were not viable, the source said. His testimony will add to the notion that everyone knew the election had been lost, the source said. \u201cThey are using Trump voices to hang Trump,\u201d the source added, referring to the committee. Stepien was Trump\u2019s final campaign manager in 2020 and was involved in critical meetings about the results on election night. In the days after the election, Stepien told reporters the Trump campaign was \u201cconfident in our math\u201d that Trump would ultimately win. He was not eager to testify but did not want to defy a subpoena, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Stepien is currently advising the campaign of Trump-endorsed Harriet Hageman, who is challenging Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming in the state\u2019s GOP primary. Cheney is a vocal Trump critic who voted to impeach him and is the vice chairwoman of the January 6 committee. Stepien\u2019s firm has received more than $190,000 from Hageman\u2019s campaign this election cycle for strategy and fundraising consulting and video production, according to federal election filings. Former Fox digital politics editor Chris Stirewalt is also among those expected to testify on Monday. Stirewalt\u2019s decision to call Arizona for Joe Biden on election night infuriated the Trump campaign and conservative Fox hosts. A second panel of witnesses testifying Monday includes former US attorney for the North District of Georgia BJay Pak, who was pressured to embrace Trump\u2019s fraud claims and resigned; former Philadelphia city commissioner Al Schmidt, who debunked false claims about election fraud in Philadelphia; and conservative election attorney Ben Ginsberg, who is expected to speak about the failed court cases pursued by Trump\u2019s team. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb, Zachary Cohen and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "With public hearings kicking off this week, the House select committee investigating January 6 is zeroing in on former President Donald Trump, and is preparing to use its platform to argue that he was responsible for grave abuses of power that nearly upended US democracy. The committee\u2019s central mission has been to uncover the full scope of Trump\u2019s unprecedented attempt to stop the transfer of power to President Joe Biden. This includes Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn his 2020 defeat by pressuring state and federal officials, and what committee members say was his \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d on January 6 while his supporters ransacked the US Capitol. What to watch for at the House's first prime-time hearing on the January 6 insurrection Lawmakers will try to convict Trump in the court of public opinion \u2013 which is all they can do, because it\u2019s not within their powers to actually indict Trump. But they have an emerging legal foundation to claim that Trump broke the law, thanks to a landmark court ruling from a federal judge who said it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Trump committed crimes regarding January 6. These highly choreographed hearings will be the panel\u2019s first opportunity to show the public what they\u2019ve learned from more than 1,000 witness interviews and 135,000 documents. An avalanche of new information about January 6 has come to light since Trump\u2019s impeachment trial in February 2021, where he was acquitted of one count of \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d \u201cWe are going to tell the story of a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election and block the transfer of power,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who serves on the committee, told the Washington Post earlier this week, adding that the committee \u201chas found evidence of concerted planning and premediated activity\u201d related to the events of January 6. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what the panel \u2013 and the press \u2013 unearthed about Trump\u2019s leadership role in the anti-democratic scheme, and how it all fits into the ongoing criminal investigations. The committee has interviewed officials from Michigan and Georgia, among other states, where Trump unsuccessfully tried to cajole local officials into nullifying Biden\u2019s votes and name him the winner. Trump also tried to enlist senior Justice Department officials to assist with these efforts. Lawmakers have also dug into the \u201cfake electors\u201d plot, which was led by Trump campaign officials and was an attempt to undermine the Electoral College process in December 2020. Congressional investigators have obtained hundreds of emails from right-wing attorney John Eastman, who directly advised Trump to pursue legally dubious methods to stay in office. This included a plan for then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw the election to Trump on January 6 while presiding over a joint session of Congress to certify Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory. In another victory for the committee, the judge in Eastman\u2019s civil case said Tuesday that the potentially criminal scheme between Trump and Eastman to obstruct the Electoral College proceedings was formed in December 2020, weeks earlier than previously established. The ruling paves the way for the panel to get additional emails that Eastman tried to keep secret. Trump and his allies pushed ahead with these efforts, and promoted the \u201cBig Lie\u201d, even after he was told by top officials, including then-Attorney General Bill Barr, that the election results were legitimate and that he lost. Even Eastman acknowledged in emails at the time that his plans were not legally sound. Lawmakers have said this suggests Trump had a corrupt state of mind. \u201cThe data is going to be compelling from the committee,\u201d former Rep. Denver Riggleman, who was a Republican advisor to the committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u00b0\u201d last week. \u201cI think it is up to the American people, after that is presented, to come up \u2013 using facts, not fantasies or opinions \u2013 on what the culpability of the President is, and the people around him.\u201d Trump, Eastman and the other GOP figures who were involved have denied wrongdoing. Spokespeople for Trump did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Once Trump failed to stop states from certifying their results, he started focusing on January 6 as his last chance to cling to power. The facts of that tragic day are well-known, but the panel is going to attempt to drive home a clear narrative from the chaos: Trump knew his supporters could get violent, but egged them on anyway, and was derelict when he didn\u2019t do try to stop the violence. \u201cThey were warned that January 6th could, and likely would, turn violent,\u201d Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the Republican vice chairwoman of the panel, said at a committee hearing in March. First prime-time January 6 hearing is critical moment of account for Trump's assault on American democracy Pence\u2019s staffers were so concerned before January 6 that they warned the US Secret Service that Trump might stoke violence against him, because he wasn\u2019t willing to overturn the election, according to The New York Times. (The Secret Service has since claimed it has \u201cno knowledge\u201d of that conversation happening.) Some of Pence\u2019s senior advisers, who have cooperated with the committee\u2019s inquiry, could potentially be called as witnesses during the public hearings. Prominent Republican officials and right-wing media figures knew in real-time that only Trump could call off the mob and bring an end to the deadly carnage at the Capitol, according to text messages that these Trump allies sent to Trump\u2019s chief of staff Mark Meadows on January 6. CNN obtained his texts after he partially complied with a subpoena to turn over the messages. Despite those pleas, according to committee members, Trump spent 187 minutes during the riot watching TV and working the phones, seemingly pleased with how his supporters were fighting for him at the Capitol. He reacted approvingly when he learned that some of the rioters were chanting \u201chang Mike Pence,\u201d according to testimony that the panel got from a Meadows aide. To zero in on these crucial hours inside the White House, the panel interviewed people who were there with Trump that day, including his daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner. Clips of their videotaped depositions will likely be played at the public hearings for the first time \u2013 which are just some of the never-before-seen details that lawmakers have teased. The hearings will likely delve into one of the most infamous episodes from Trump\u2019s attempts to subvert the election: His phone call with Georgia\u2019s top election official, where Trump falsely claimed that the election was rigged and pleaded with him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to let him win. The explosive call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was serious enough to trigger a criminal investigation by state prosecutors in Atlanta. The district attorney there has convened a special grand jury and has started issuing subpoenas, and has broadened the probe to also look at the \u201cfake electors\u201d plot to subvert the results in Georgia. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, has said she\u2019s not adhering to a political schedule with her investigation and will follow the facts wherever they lead. Trump has denied wrongdoing. The probe is widely considered one of the gravest ongoing legal threats to Trump. Federal investigators have feverishly rounded up more than 800 alleged rioters, making arrests in almost every state. But the question remains (especially among Democrats): Will the Justice Department go after Trump? There are some signs that prosecutors are moving up the food chain. FBI agents interviewed Republicans in Michigan and Georgia who were involved in the \u201cfake electors\u201d plot, which puts the probe one step closer to Trump\u2019s orbit. The Justice Department is asking witnesses about the role of Eastman and former Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, according to The New York Times. Federal grand jury subpoenas have been issued to at least one figure who planned pro-Trump rallies in Washington, DC, on January 6. The organizer, Ali Alexander, says he is complying. Investigators\u2019 interest in Alexander show that they aren\u2019t only looking at the rioters themselves. Separately, the Justice Department has charged former Trump advisers Steve Bannon and Peter Navarro with contempt of Congress for defying committee subpoenas. (They maintain their innocence.) Prosecutors declined to charge Meadows and another top Trump White House aide, Dan Scavino, who claimed that executive privilege protected them from having to testify. It\u2019s unclear how far the Justice Department will go to investigate Trump. Attorney General Merrick Garland said he is \u201ccommitted to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law,\u201d but many legal analysts have expressed skepticism that he\u2019ll go after Trump, based on the slowness of the probe and the challenges of charging a former President.",

            "article_content": "The Department of Justice has informed the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection that it will not indict two former Trump White House officials found in contempt by the committee. According to a source familiar with the notification, US Attorney Matt Graves notified Doug Letter, the House general counsel, that the Justice Department had completed its review and had decided it \u201cwill not be initiating prosecutions for criminal contempt, as requested in the referral against Messrs Meadows and Scavino.\u201d The New York Times first reported the news that Mark Meadows, former chief of staff to then-President Donald Trump, and Dan Scavino, former deputy chief of staff to Trump, won\u2019t be prosecuted. The decision by the Justice Department is a blow to the House panel\u2019s efforts to enforce subpoenas related to its investigation and could embolden other Trump associates facing similar requests to not cooperate. It comes the same day that former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro was indicted for failing to cooperate with the committee. Grand jury indicts former Trump adviser Peter Navarro for contempt of Congress Unlike Scavino and Meadows, however, Navarro openly defied the committee\u2019s request and made no attempt to negotiate terms to comply. And the subpoenas of Meadows and Scavino were complicated. Both officials served in high-level positions in the Trump West Wing and thus had more compelling cases for claiming executive privilege. Each also made an effort to cooperate with the committee at different points in its investigation. Meadows notably handed over thousands of pages of documents, including text messages that have become an important part of the committee\u2019s work. Scavino\u2019s attorney Stan Brand applauded the decision in a statement to CNN, saying, \u201cI\u2019m grateful they (the Justice Department) exercised their discretion not to bring this case.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment. A spokesperson for the January 6 select committee did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Exclusive: Federal investigation into Trump fake elector probe expands to multiple states An attorney familiar with the Meadows and Scavino cases told CNN they were not surprised by the Justice Department\u2019s decision. They argued that both men had engaged the committee, and that unlike Navarro and Steve Bannon, who have both been indicted, Scavino and Meadows had serious claims of privilege. Navarro \u2013 who faces two contempt counts: one for his failure to produce documents demanded by the committee and the other for failing to show up for subpoenaed testimony before House investigators \u2013 is the second former Trump adviser to be indicted for criminal contempt of Congress for defying a January 6 committee subpoena. Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon faces a criminal trial later this summer. The Justice Department has come under pressure from House Democrats and others on the left for not being more aggressive in its January 6 investigation, particularly as it concerns the role Trump and his inner circle played in seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election and in making unfounded accusations of mass voter fraud that propelled the violent assault on the US Capitol. There have been recent indications, however, that the department has ramped up its investigation into a scheme to put forward fraudulent slates of Trump-supporting electors in states that President Joe Biden won. This story has been updated with additional details Friday.",

            "article_content": "Within minutes of the US Capitol breach on January 6, 2021, messages began pouring into the cell phone of White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Among those texting were Republican members of Congress, former members of the Trump administration, GOP activists, Fox personalities \u2013 even the President\u2019s son. Their texts all carried the same urgent plea: President Donald Trump needed to immediately denounce the violence and tell the mob to go home. \u201cHe\u2019s got to condem (sic) this shit. Asap,\u201d Donald Trump Jr. texted at 2:53 p.m. \u201cPOTUS needs to calm this shit down,\u201d GOP Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina wrote at 3:04 p.m. \u201cTELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!\u201d former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus messaged at 3:09 p.m. \u201cPOTUS should go on air and defuse this. Extremely important,\u201d Tom Price, former Trump health and human services secretary and a former GOP representative from Georgia, texted at 3:13 p.m. \u201cFix this now,\u201d wrote GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas at 3:15 p.m. One of the key questions the January 6 House committee is expected to raise in its June hearings is why Trump failed to publicly condemn the attack for hours, and whether that failure is proof of \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d and evidence that Trump tried to obstruct Congress\u2019 certification of the election. The Meadows texts show that even those closest to the former President believed he had the power to stop the violence in real time. CNN obtained the 2,319 text messages that Meadows selectively handed over to the January 6 committee in December before he stopped cooperating with the investigation. According to a source familiar with the committee\u2019s investigation, the texts provide a valuable \u201croad map\u201d and show how Meadows was an enabler of Trump, despite being told there was no widespread election fraud. Seventeen months later, CNN spoke to more than a dozen people who had texted Meadows that day, including former White House officials, Republican members of Congress and political veterans. Without exception, each said they stood by their texts and that they believed Trump had the power and responsibility to try to stop the attack immediately. \u201cI thought the President could stop it and was the only person who could stop it,\u201d said Alyssa Farah Griffin, who was Trump\u2019s director of strategic communications until she left the White House in December 2020. Farah Griffin is now a CNN political commentator. \u201cWhen he finally tweeted something hours and hours later, there are reports of people inside the building saying, \u2018He\u2019s saying to go home.\u2019 They would have listened to him,\u201d she added. Farah Griffin texted Meadows at 3:13 p.m. that day: \u201cPotus has to come out firmly and tell protesters to dissipate. Someone is going to get killed.\u201d Trump\u2019s former acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, also texted Meadows on January 6: \u201cMark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?\u201d Mulvaney told CNN he stands by his text. \u201cI wish someone had responded to my outreach,\u201d he said. Most of the people who spoke to CNN about their texts on January 6 would be quoted only anonymously. Some said it was because of their jobs. Some said they were afraid Trump would be reelected. One said they just didn\u2019t want to go through \u201cthe misery of being targeted by Trump supporters.\u201d Their words were blunt, emotional and damning, even those who remain staunch Trump allies. \u201cI thought there was only one person who could stop it and that was the President,\u201d said a senior Republican. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I can think of another situation that was as grave for the nation, or as affecting for the nation, where the President didn\u2019t say something.\u201d A Meadows associate said Trump had waited too long to act: \u201cTwo hours is just inexcusable \u2026 when the safety of the federal government is in question you have the duty immediately to speak out. And Trump was derelict in that duty.\u201d Another political veteran said Trump\u2019s silence made him complicit: \u201cI think he knew he could stop it, which is why he remained silent.\u201d And a former Trump administration official summed it up with this stark assessment: \u201cHe failed at being the president.\u201d An attorney for Meadows did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the January 6 committee also did not respond to a request for comment. The Meadows text logs present a dramatic timeline of how friends, colleagues and Republican allies were pleading for help on January 6. Rioters stormed police barriers around the Capitol just after 1 p.m. that day. The House and Senate fled their chambers around 2:20 p.m. Yet it took Trump until 4:17 p.m. to release a video on Twitter telling the rioters to go home. The upcoming January 6 hearings are expected to focus on the gap of 187 minutes it took Trump to release the video \u2013 as well as highlight some of the most notable texts that Meadows received and sent that day. The logs are not a complete record of Meadows\u2019 texts \u2013 he withheld more than 1,000 messages, claiming executive privilege, according to the committee. But the messages Meadows did hand over show his responses were often terse and emotionless, if he replied at all. Two sources familiar with the committee\u2019s investigation said it was remarkable that Meadows never seemed alarmed in the messages he sent on January 6, and that even in the midst of the violence, he appeared unwilling to stand up to Trump. \u201cEven Don Jr. knew the right thing to do,\u201d one source told CNN. On January 5, the Meadows text logs show that the chief of staff was still actively involved with plans to object to the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election victory, encouraging Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to pass on evidence of voter fraud. \u201cLast night Sen Graham told me that if I found 100 names of dead voters in GA that he would object. I have 100 dead voters names!! Tell President Trump!\u201d Greene, a Georgia Republican, texted Meadows at 2:30 p.m. \u201cSend them to him,\u201d Meadows responded, making sure she had Graham\u2019s cell phone number. At 10:29 p.m., Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity chimed in with an apprehensive message over what was to come. READ: Text messages Sean Hannity, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Ivanka Trump and others sent to Mark Meadows \u201cI\u2019m very worried about the next 48 hours,\u201d Hannity texted Meadows. \u201cPence pressure. WH counsel will leave.\u201d Meadows did not reply directly, but he appeared to have called Hannity, who texted that he couldn\u2019t pick up the phone. \u201cOn with boss,\u201d Hannity texted, an apparent reference to Trump. The last message Meadows received on January 5 is from his close friend and Trump ally Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. Shortly before midnight, Jordan forwarded a message making the case that Vice President Mike Pence \u201cshould call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.\u201d The morning of January 6, Meadows woke up to three problems: logistics for that day\u2019s rally on the Ellipse, Pence\u2019s refusal to join Trump\u2019s attempts to subvert the election and the US Senate runoffs the day before in Georgia, where both Republicans were trailing. At 7:30 a.m., Meadows responded to Jordan\u2019s message from the night before, acknowledging his support for Pence to reject the electoral votes. \u201cI have pushed for this,\u201d Meadows wrote back. \u201cNot sure it is going to happen.\u201d Meadows then turned his attention to the January 6 rally, where Trump was slated to speak later that morning. Meadows had been involved with the fraught internal drama over the speaker\u2019s list in the days leading up to the event. Meadows checked in to make sure one of the speakers, Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, knew he was supposed to appear. \u201cYou are speaking this am. Are you aware,\u201d Meadows asked at 8:08 a.m. Brooks, who gave one of the more incendiary speeches of the day, responded at 9:33 a.m., after leaving the stage: \u201cDid it in 10m. Thanks! Crowd roaring.\u201d Jordan and Brooks are two of five House Republicans who have been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee. At 11 a.m., Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller shared a tweet with Meadows and other top Trump aides capturing the darkening mood inside Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s camp with Democrats poised to take control of the Senate. \u201cEmotions running high among McConnell-aligned Republicans early Wednesday am \u2014 after reality of what transpired in Georgia settled in,\u201d National Journal reporter Josh Kraushaar wrote in the tweet. \u201cMay be the heat of the moment, but mood is for declaring war on Team Trump.\u201d At 1:05 p.m., while Trump was still addressing the crowd at the Ellipse, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gaveled in the joint session inside the Capitol to begin certifying Biden\u2019s Electoral College win. Outside the Capitol, pro-Trump supporters were already breaking through police barriers. Roughly an hour later, rioters clashed with police and breached the Capitol doors, forcing the House and Senate to abruptly gavel out of session and evacuate the chambers. According to court filings, at 2:02 p.m. Meadows\u2019 deputy Ben Williamson sent his boss a text message about the violence unfolding at the Capitol. The text is not included in the logs Meadows turned over, but Williamson provided it to the committee. \u201cWould recommend POTUS put out a tweet about respecting the police over at the Capitol \u2013 getting a little hairy over there,\u201d Williamson wrote. Williamson said he had then spoken to Meadows in person and that Meadows had immediately gone toward the Oval Office to inform Trump, according to court documents. Shortly afterward, Meadows began receiving messages about the mob at the door. \u201cWill potus say something to tamp things down?\u201d wrote CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta at 2:12 p.m. Despite Williamson\u2019s advice urging the President to send a message about respecting the police, Trump tweeted again at 2:24 p.m., attacking his vice president. \u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!\u201d Trump tweeted. Four minutes later, Trump\u2019s allies began imploring Meadows to convince the President to do something. The first message came from Greene. \u201cMark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn\u2019t the way to solve anything,\u201d Greene wrote at 2:28 p.m. Fox\u2019s Laura Ingraham texted Meadows at 2:32 p.m., \u201cHey Mark, The president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us.\u201d Meadows heard from local contacts, too, including one who castigated the White House chief of staff for his role leading up to the insurrection. At 2:34 p.m., North Carolina-based Republican strategist Carlton Huffman wrote, \u201cYou\u2019ve earned a special place in infamy for the events of today. And if you\u2019re the Christian you claim to be in your heart you know that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s really bad up here on the hill,\u201d texted Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia at 2:44 p.m. At 2:46 p.m., GOP Rep. Will Timmons of South Carolina wrote to Meadows: \u201cThe president needs to stop this ASAP.\u201d Several who texted Meadows told CNN they hoped their messages would convince the chief of staff to stand up to Trump and get him to stop the violence. At 2:48 p.m., Meadows responded to Loudermilk that \u201cPOTUS is engaging.\u201d But Trump would not tell the rioters to leave the Capitol for another hour and a half as messages continued to pour in from Trump allies, Meadows associates and reporters seeking a White House response. Jonathan Karl of ABC News texted at 2:53 p.m., \u201cWhat are you going to do to stop this? What is the president going to do?\u201d Karl said of his text to Meadows, \u201cI was asking a question as a reporter who wanted to know what was happening inside the White House as the Capitol was being attacked. But I was also asking as an American horrified by what I was witnessing.\u201d Meadows received more messages from contacts in his home state urging Trump to intervene. At 3:42 p.m., North Carolina-based lobbyist Tom Cors wrote, \u201cPls have POTUS call this off at the Capitol. Urge rioters to disperse. I pray to you.\u201d At 3:52 p.m., North Carolina lawyer Jay Leutze texted, \u201cMark, this assault in the Capitol is tragic for the country. Please call it off so the Congress can resume its peaceful debate.\u201d Finally, at 4:17 p.m., Trump released a video message telling the rioters to leave the Capitol. The video he tweeted was just over a minute long. \u201cI know your pain. I know you\u2019re hurt,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We don\u2019t want anybody hurt.\u201d Trump concluded, \u201cSo go home. We love you, you\u2019re very special. You\u2019ve seen what happens, you see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel, but go home and go home in peace.\u201d Trump\u2019s video helped ease some of the pressure being directed toward Meadows. Priebus, a former White House chief of staff, told Meadows at 4:20 p.m., \u201cGood that you made that video.\u201d The video also wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s final word. At 6:01 p.m., he sent another tweet once again falsely claiming fraud. Trump\u2019s Twitter account was suspended a little over an hour later before he was ultimately banned from the platform. \u201cThese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cGo home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\u201d That evening, Meadows received numerous queries from reporters asking about the fallout of the insurrection, such as questions about whether Cabinet secretaries were resigning or considering invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. He was asked about Pence\u2019s situation, too, including by Hannity, who texted at 7:57 p.m., \u201cWth is happening with VPOTUS.\u201d Meadows does not appear to have responded. READ: 82 texts between Sean Hannity and Mark Meadows Several reporters also texted Meadows asking whether he personally was considering resigning. \u201cOff the record. No,\u201d he responded at 10:21 p.m. to reporter Al Weaver of The Hill. While rioters were still being cleared from the Capitol, there were questions about whether the House and Senate would reconvene to finish counting the electoral votes. Republican and Democratic leaders in both chambers vowed to do so. At 8:06 p.m., Pence gaveled the Senate back into session. \u201cToday was a dark day in the history of the United States Capitol,\u201d he began from the Senate dais. The vice president condemned the violence and said the reassembled lawmakers were there to defend and support the Constitution. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to work,\u201d he concluded to loud cheers. After two months of trying to overturn the 2020 election, the Meadows text logs show, Trump\u2019s team had prepared a draft statement once the certification was complete, which said there \u201cwill be an orderly transition on January 20th.\u201d In a group text at 10:01 p.m., Trump campaign spokesman Miller reached out to Meadows, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and Trump aide Dan Scavino. \u201cChief, Jared, Dan - below please find an approved statement from the President to go out right as they\u2019re finalizing the votes, which we\u2019re expecting to be 3am, though with some Members caving it could happen earlier,\u201d Miller texted. \u201cMrs. Trump has also signed off.\u201d Kushner weighed in with a suggestion about how to release the statement. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we post on his Facebook page since he isn\u2019t locked out there,\u201d Kushner wrote, after Trump had been suspended from Twitter a few hours earlier. \u201cI\u2019ll be up,\u201d responded Scavino, \u201clet me know when ok to drop, and it\u2019s official\u2026just got off w/them.\u201d In the end, Scavino tweeted the statement from his personal account at 3:49 a.m. on January 7, five minutes after Biden\u2019s win was finally certified and Pence gaveled out the joint session of Congress.",

            "article_content": "Former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro has been subpoenaed by the Justice Department \u2013 the first indication the department is acting on the criminal referral from the House of Representatives to hold Donald Trump\u2019s one-time trade adviser in contempt of Congress for his refusal to cooperate with the House select committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol. Navarro, who revealed Monday that he had been subpoenaed by federal prosecutors, said he will respond by the end of Wednesday. The New York Times was first to report Monday that Navarro said he\u2019d been subpoenaed. The subpoena from the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, a copy of which CNN obtained on Tuesday, specifically requests \u201call documents relating to the subpoena dated February 9, 2022, that you received from the House Select Committee to investigate the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, including but not limited to any communications with former President Trump and/or his counsel or representatives.\u201d The US Attorney\u2019s Office declined to comment on the subpoena. In April, the House voted to recommend Navarro be referred to the Justice Department on criminal contempt of Congress charges for refusing to comply with the select committee\u2019s February subpoena. The grand jury subpoena was revealed in a draft copy of a lawsuit obtained by CNN on Monday that Navarro said he intended to file against the House select committee, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the US attorney for the District of Columbia. Navarro is representing himself in the suit and is seeking to convince a federal judge to block both the House committee\u2019s subpoena and the grand jury\u2019s subpoena, which he says are unlawful. \u201cThe kangaroo committee gave me an illegal and unenforceable subpoena. I failed to comply because of the untenable situation that put me in with respect to honoring executive privilege,\u201d Navarro told CNN on Tuesday about the select committee\u2019s subpoena. Navarro has been public about his attempts to work with the Trump campaign to subvert the 2020 presidential election. In a recent book, the former White House trade adviser details a plan called the \u201cGreen Bay Sweep,\u201d which involved convincing state leaders in several swing states to call election results into question in an attempt to delay and eventually prevent the election\u2019s certification. Navarro maintains in the book that he was among the \u201clast three people on God\u2019s green earth who wanted to see violence erupt\u201d on January 6, 2021 \u2013 counting himself among the likes of Trump and Trump ally and adviser Steve Bannon. In an appearance on Bannon\u2019s podcast earlier this year, Navarro appeared to criticize former Vice President Mike Pence for saying Trump had been wrong to claim Pence had the authority to overturn the 2020 election. Navarro blasted Pence as \u201cnever a pure Trump guy\u201d and \u201cthe prisoner of Marc Short,\u201d a longtime Pence confidant and the former vice president\u2019s chief of staff, who has appeared before the House select committee.

            "article_content": "Special counsel John Durham\u2019s prosecutors laid out their case against Hillary Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann during opening statements Tuesday, accusing him of scheming \u201cto inject the FBI into a presidential election\u201d by peddling an ultimately unsubstantiated tip about Donald Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, eight weeks before Election Day. \u201cThe defendant\u2019s lie was all part of a bigger plan. \u2026 It was a plan to create an October surprise on the eve of the election \u2026 to use and manipulate the FBI,\u201d prosecutor Brittain Shaw said. She described Sussmann as a \u201chigh-powered DC lawyer\u201d who \u201clied to direct the power and resources of the FBI to his own ends, and to serve the agendas of his clients,\u201d who were the Clinton campaign and a tech executive. \u201cThis is a case about privilege,\u201d Shaw added. Sussmann has been charged with one count of lying to the FBI, and the case was brought as part of Durham\u2019s investigation into potential misconduct related to the FBI\u2019s Trump-Russia probe. The indictment accuses Sussmann of falsely telling the FBI he wasn\u2019t representing any clients when he provided the Trump-Russia tip in September 2016. Sussmann has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors appealed to the jurors to set politics aside and convict Sussmann because, they say, he abused the trust of senior FBI officials to try to help Clinton win the 2016 presidential election. Jurors\u2019 political affiliations, contributions and volunteer work for candidates, including Clinton, repeatedly came up during the jury selection process. \u201cWhether we hate Donald Trump or like him, we have to agree that some things have to be above politics. One of those things is our law enforcement agencies, and the other is truth,\u201d Shaw said. Who's who in the Michael Sussmann trial The case, playing out in DC federal court, is expected to last about two weeks. It\u2019s the first major courtroom test of the three-year Durham investigation. For the second day, Durham was in court for the all-day proceedings, and huddled with his team in the hallways during breaks. In opening statements, Sussmann\u2019s defense attorney said the case was \u201can injustice\u201d and vehemently denied that he was part of any scheme to deceive the FBI. His lawyer, Michael Bosworth, argued that all Sussmann wanted to do was get information to the press about Trump\u2019s ties to Russia. Once a major outlet was ready to publish the material, Sussmann wanted \u201cto help the FBI\u201d and warn them that a story was coming, Bosworth said. \u201cThe meeting with the FBI is the exact opposite of what the Clinton campaign would\u2019ve wanted,\u201d Bosworth said, explaining that the FBI quashed the news story after learning about it from Sussmann. \u201cThe FBI meeting is something they didn\u2019t authorize, they didn\u2019t direct him to do, and they didn\u2019t want him to do.\u201d Bosworth lambasted Durham\u2019s central theory of the case, telling jurors it is \u201cnonsensical\u201d that Sussmann was trying to conceal his ties to the Clinton campaign. For one, Sussmann\u2019s partisan ties were well-known to the FBI at the time, largely because he was the Democratic National Committee\u2019s lawyer after they were hacked by the Russians in 2016. \u201cHis partisan affiliations, they were out and about, loud and clear for everyone to see,\u201d Bosworth said, as he displayed some of Sussmann\u2019s emails to the FBI in his role as the DNC\u2019s lawyer. Bosworth added: \u201cIf he was trying to dupe the FBI, why give them the data that they could evaluate for themselves? \u2026 He had a genuine interest in national security and doing the right thing.\u201d The first day of witness testimony shed considerable new light on the FBI\u2019s efforts to run down Sussmann\u2019s tip \u2013 that the Trump Organization had a secret server that was potentially communicating with Russia-based Alfa Bank during 2016, perhaps to collude on the election. It\u2019s been public for years that the FBI determined there weren\u2019t improper cyber links. But the US government hasn\u2019t previously told the public what the FBI did to reach that conclusion. FBI special agent Scott Hellman, a cyber division supervisor who examined Sussmann\u2019s data and a \u201cwhite paper\u201d with assertions about the data, testified that the people behind the material performed a \u201cquestionable\u201d analysis and \u201cjumped to some conclusions that were not supported.\u201d \u201cI thought perhaps the person who had drafted this document was suffering from some mental disability,\u201d Hellmann said, after he was asked to explain what he meant in an internal FBI chat message that he sent after reviewing the white paper, where he said: \u201cit feels a little 5150-ish.\u201d Durham\u2019s team also revealed the FBI\u2019s final conclusion on what the data showed. This has remained one of the unsettled mysteries from the 2016 election, especially after special counsel Robert Mueller released his sweeping report but never mentioned the Trump-Alfa server claims. The FBI investigation found \u201cthe server was merely a spam email server used for sending out marketing emails,\u201d Shaw told the jury during her opening statements. \u201cThe server did not reflect a crime, nor was it a threat to national security.\u201d The spam server theory was previously put forward by Alfa Bank. A bipartisan Senate report said in 2020 that it accepted the FBI\u2019s findings about the \u201cunusual activity,\u201d but noted that the two companies gave contradictory explanations for what happened. Over the years, some cybersecurity experts have raised questions about the thoroughness of the FBI\u2019s inquiry. Hellmann said he made his findings within one day, before passing the case onto other investigators in the FBI\u2019s counterintelligence division. He said he didn\u2019t attempt to interview the researchers who compiled the data, didn\u2019t seek search warrants or subpoenas. This story has been updated with further developments on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee has narrowed what it wants to ask former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, as it continues to press for more documents and testimony from the key January 6 witness in the Trump White House. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to a lot of Mr. Meadows\u2019 associates and people who worked with him,\u201d Douglas Letter, House general counsel, said in court on Wednesday at a hearing about a lawsuit Meadows brought against the committee. The committee now has \u201claser-like focus\u201d after obtaining thousands of documents and hundreds of other witness interviews, Letter added. But the committee still has questions for Meadows. The House\u2019s legal standoff with Meadows is now poised to come to a head in court in the first half of June \u2013 around the same time the committee is planning to hold its first public hearings in its sweeping investigation. It is at the front of a collection of several slower-moving cases where witnesses have sued to block the committee\u2019s subpoenas. Judge Carl Nichols of the DC District Court said he would aim to potentially hold major court hearings in Meadows\u2019 lawsuit, where the former Trump White House chief of staff argues he does not have to testify to the House, in the first two weeks of June. It was unclear how soon Nichols would rule after that. The House committee has told the court it wants a ruling quickly, in the hopes that a decision in the House\u2019s favor at the trial level would prompt Meadows to sit for an interview. But a ruling against him from Nichols doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Meadows would agree to testify right away, his lawyer, George Terwilliger, said on Wednesday. He could still appeal, if he were to lose. \u201cWe intend to adjudicate Mr. Meadows\u2019 rights in connection with that subpoena as fully and completely as we can,\u201d Terwilliger said. Meadows is perhaps the most prominent witness invited by the House not to have sat for an interview, save for Donald Trump and Mike Pence. The House subpoenaed Meadows for documents and testimony in October, and he handed over more than 2,000 text messages he sent and received between Election Day 2020 and the Biden inauguration. The text messages, which have since been obtained by CNN, reveal how top Republican Party officials, right-wing figures and even Trump\u2019s family members discussed with him what the President should say and do after the election and even in the middle of the insurrection. Meadows did not turn over other documents he had, and the House committee voted to hold him in criminal contempt of Congress for it and for his refusal to testify, referring the matter to the Justice Department. He has not been charged with a crime. While the contempt proceeding bubbled up late last year, Meadows went to court, suing the committee. Citing the possibility that information around the ex-President may be privileged, Meadows has told the court he cannot testify and also has sought to block a House subpoena for his phone records. Other White House advisers including Ben Williamson, one of Meadows\u2019 top advisers, met with the committee for hours, while another, then-White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, has not and was also held in contempt. The case was initially structured to move slowly, but the House\u2019s recent maneuvering may send it toward crucial decisions this summer. A handful of other judges \u2013 including the Supreme Court \u2013 have already ruled that some of the House committee\u2019s pursuits in the January 6, 2021, investigation are valid and could not be blocked by Trump\u2019s attempts to make privilege assertions. Just this week, another judge in the DC District Court decided the House select committee is properly comprised and one of its subpoenas was valid.",

            "article_content": "The Trump family\u2019s cooperation with the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol \u2013 and Ivanka Trump\u2019s appearance in particular \u2013 has proven useful in confirming other key testimony about the state of play inside the White House as well as then-President Donald Trump\u2019s state of mind that day. In a recent exclusive interview with CNN, committee Chairman Bennie Thompson gave the most extensive account yet of the testimony behind closed doors. \u201cThere were questions asked about what was she doing at the time that the insurrection was occurring at the Capitol, and she told us,\u201d the Mississippi Democrat said of Ivanka Trump. Investigators \u201casked certain questions about her awareness of what her father was doing. She told us.\u201d January 6 committee to hold 8 hearings in June, chairman says While Thompson was careful to point out that Donald Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law Jared Kushner did not give away any \u201ctrade secrets,\u201d and that their testimony was not against Trump himself, he said the couple did corroborate critical testimony from others who said the then-President was reluctant to try to call off the rioters despite being asked to do so. \u201cThey kinda supported the fact that the President was told he had to do something to stop the January 6 insurrection. That he had to be public with it; he had to be direct,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo in that respect \u2026 we have been able to systematically, with our depositions and interviewing of other witnesses, we\u2019ve been able to fill in a lot of the gaps.\u201d The committee heard evidence from more than one witness, including former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s national security adviser Keith Kellogg, who said Ivanka Trump was sometimes with her father as he watched the riot unfold on TV in a room off the Oval Office. Such testimony is key, especially with an hours-long gap in the presidential daily diary during that period on January 6. A person close to the Trump family told CNN the former President\u2019s children never saw a reason not to cooperate with the committee because none of them felt appearing before the panel put them at any risk. They also perceived the committee\u2019s decision not to subpoena them as a sign that they weren\u2019t walking into a contentious situation. This person also noted that Kushner was traveling in the Middle East on January 6, 2021, and got Covid-19 upon return, adding that he wasn\u2019t involved in planning the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally or in communication with some of the fringe figures who were counseling his father-in-law on ways to overturn the election. Ivanka Trump and Kushner did not invoke the Fifth Amendment or claim privilege during their interviews, according to two sources familiar with the matter. A representative for Ivanka Trump and Kushner did not respond to a request for comment. Thompson\u2019s description of the importance of this family testimony reflects a curious evolving pattern of some top advisers to the former President refusing to share with the committee what they witnessed of Trump, while key family members \u2013 some of whom were also top White House aides \u2013 go ahead and talk to the committee. In addition to Ivanka Trump and Kushner, Donald Trump Jr. is expected to testify, and he and the committee are working to schedule his appearance. His fianc\u00e9e, Kimberly Guilfoyle, spoke to the committee last month. In his interview with CNN, Thompson questioned why the former President did not object to his family members testifying while key White House aides are now being held in contempt of Congress by the House after refusing to testify, saying they had been instructed by the President to claim executive privilege over their conversations. \u201cNow we have four individuals who are being held in contempt of Congress because they were directed by the President not to come. So they are under the bus, but his children are not. They came,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cNow to me, that\u2019s Donald Trump that we are discovering. It\u2019s \u2018do as I say, but not do as I do.\u2019 Do you understand? I say don\u2019t go and testify, but when my children or my in-laws are involved, you can go testify.\u201d Thompson said he was unaware of whether the family members sought permission from the former President to talk to the committee or spoke with him beforehand. \u201cI just know that if the children went and the others didn\u2019t because he told them not to go, based on their own accounting, that\u2019s just suspicious,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI think it\u2019s ironic that he would tell some people not to come and they follow his direction and get held in contempt of Congress,\u201d while his children do the opposite. \u201cSo, I mean, that\u2019s kind of who he is.\u201d The Biden White House has uniformly refused to assert privilege for former White House aides, including Kushner and Ivanka Trump. Donald Trump told The Washington Post that he had offered the couple \u201cprivilege\u201d if they wanted it, but they declined. The former President also called his daughter\u2019s eight-hour interview a \u201cshame and harassment.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said, \u201cThis committee has exposed itself as partisan hacks who have tampered and edited evidence, while also selectively leaking testimony to peddle their dishonest political agenda. To make matters worse, their allies in the media are going along with it, parroting half truths and Democrat talking points as gospel.\u201d Top former Trump advisers Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows, Dan Scavino and Peter Navarro have been held in contempt of Congress by the House for holding back information from the committee. Bannon, the only one to face criminal contempt charges so far, has tied his podcast brand, in part, to supporting Trump. Yet several other advisers to the former President have sat for lengthy interviews, such as Guilfoyle, administration official Stephen Miller and even top lawyers from the White House. Thompson has said the committee is open to subpoenaing the former President if necessary. Major new clashes between the committee and the ex-President have been at a minimum since Trump lost his attempt to keep secret documents from his White House, and lawyers for Trump have had a relatively haphazard approach to how witnesses from the White House should handle their testimony, according to several people familiar with the committee\u2019s conversations with top witnesses. Based on the logs of texts, reviewed by CNN, that were provided to the committee by Meadows, both Ivanka Trump and Kushner were part of a group text chain on November 5, 2020, in which Ivanka Trump told her White House and campaign colleagues: \u201cYou are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight!\u201d On January 6, 2021, Ivanka Trump wrote a tweet, which she later deleted, calling the rioters \u201cpatriots.\u201d But gradually, she has backed away from any overt support for those who stormed the Capitol and false claims of election fraud. CNN Exclusive: Meadows' texts reveal new details about the key role a little-known GOP congressman played in efforts to overturn election Kellogg\u2019s testimony before the House committee described the important role Ivanka Trump played on January 6, calling her \u201cheroic.\u201d Kellogg recalled that she went to speak to her father in the White House \u201cbecause Ivanka Trump can be pretty tenacious. And I think she went back in on more than one occasion to try to get a sense of \u2013 sense of what was going on. And I think she just \u2013 that\u2019s just, my experience, that\u2019s her nature,\u201d Kellogg testified. \u201cIvanka could bring raw truth to an issue. And I thought if there was any adviser in the White House in four years that could talk to her dad as a dad, it was Ivanka. It wasn\u2019t Jared. It wasn\u2019t me. It wasn\u2019t anybody. It was a daughter to a dad,\u201d Kellogg testified. \u201cSo I knew she was the hold card.\u201d Kellogg indicated Ivanka Trump had more sway with her father than other staffers for one reason in particular: \u201cWe\u2019re not blood.\u201d The text chain group, first published by CNN, also included campaign aides Bill Stepien and Jason Miller, along with advisers Hope Hicks, Meadows and Scavino. On December 4, in one of the few messages Meadows received from Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law shared a fact check of one of the most prominent election fraud claims from Georgia. The article showed that despite inflammatory claims of poll workers stashing suitcases filled with ballots under a table, that did not, in fact, occur. And on January 6, Miller wrote to Kushner, Meadows and Scavino that while he \u201ctotally disagreed with the outcome of the election and the facts bear me out\u2026.nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.\u201d Kushner responded at 10:10 p.m. that night: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we post on his Facebook page since he isn\u2019t locked out there\u2026\u201d Thompson also confirmed to CNN that the committee knows, from multiple sources, that Trump \u201cwas told that he had lost the election by a number of people, and he just refused to accept it. \u2026 I think he wanted all hell to break loose.\u201d Jamie Gangel, Katelyn Polantz, Ryan Nobles and Zachary Cohen contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Rudy Giuliani is expected to appear next month before the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, according to sources familiar with the matter. The expected appearance comes after months of negotiations between lawmakers and the former mayor of New York, who served as former President Donald Trump\u2019s personal attorney for much of his presidency. Giuliani, a central figure in Trump\u2019s failed bid to overturn the 2020 election, was subpoenaed by the committee in January and has been engaging with lawmakers, through his lawyer, about the scope of the subpoena and whether he may be able to comply with some requests. In its subpoena, the committee alleges Giuliani \u201cactively promoted claims of election fraud on behalf of the former President and sought to convince state legislators to take steps to overturn the election results.\u201d The subpoena also states Giuliani was in contact with Trump and members of Congress \u201cregarding strategies for delaying or overturning the results of the 2020 election.\u201d CNN has previously reported that Giuliani oversaw efforts in December 2020 to put forward illegitimate electors from seven states that Trump lost, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the scheme. CNN also has previously reported that Giuliani may be willing to testify about claims of election fraud but that he did not intend to waive executive or attorney-client privilege. It is unclear whether the committee has agreed to honor Giuliani\u2019s concerns about privilege, but he can invoke privilege protections in response to individual questions if he so chooses. As with other witnesses under subpoena, the committee has previously said it expected Giuliani to \u201ccooperate fully.\u201d The committee declined to comment Wednesday on Giuliani\u2019s expected appearance. His upcoming appearance comes as several high-profile individuals from Trump\u2019s inner orbit have recently spoken with the committee voluntarily. Trump\u2019s daughter and former senior White House adviser, Ivanka Trump, was interviewed for nearly eight hours earlier this month, and her husband, Jared Kushner, has met with the panel as well. Donald Trump Jr. also is expected to meet with the committee in the coming weeks. Giuliani also faces legal jeopardy on several other fronts. CNN has reported that federal prosecutors in New York may soon reach a charging decision regarding his foreign lobbying efforts involving Ukraine. He also faces possible fines or settlements for his actions trying to overturn the 2020 election results to favor Trump. And Dominion Voting Systems has filed a billion-dollar defamation lawsuit against Giuliani for his unfounded election fraud claims.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Not a week seems to go by without Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis proposing or signing some bill that aggravates progressives, worries civil rights leaders or penalizes politically correct corporations. He\u2019s a generational talent at seizing headlines. This is the stuff presidential ambitions are made of. This week, it was Florida\u2019s second major election overhaul in as many years, in which DeSantis created a new election police force focused on election fraud. It would be under his control, even though he\u2019s up for reelection in November. Read more from CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten. But what kind of president would DeSantis be? Heir to Trump. With the exception of former President Donald Trump, who wants his old job back, no single person has generated more major campaign inevitability than DeSantis. But while Trump is cloistered at his private clubs and doing some rallies and fundraisers, DeSantis has turned his state position into a national platform \u2013 more than any governor in recent memory. DeSantis has to win his reelection campaign in November before he can really start thinking about a run for the White House in 2024, which he hasn\u2019t yet officially announced. But everything he\u2019s doing seems focused on endearing him to conservatives. Isn\u2019t it too early to talk about 2024? President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings are stubbornly underwater, the country is as divided as ever and at least one major bank is girding for a recession in the near future. It\u2019s not crazy to think these three things \u2013 disappointment, division and the threat of a downturn \u2013 create a difficult environment for Biden\u2019s reelection. Granted, we\u2019re not yet halfway through his presidency. But it\u2019s important to consider the alternatives since you can be sure they\u2019re already plotting campaign strategies. The Fox candidate. As DeSantis was turning on Disney for its opposition to a new Florida law many consider to be anti-LGBTQ, CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza noted that the political move \u2013 like many of DeSantis\u2019 policy proposals \u2013 had followed days of squawking by Fox personalities. Cillizza wrote: On everything from Covid-19 mitigation measures (or a lack thereof) to critical race theory to the mental acuity of President Joe Biden, DeSantis has used Fox as both a guidepost and an amplifier of where to stand on these issues. DeSantis understood, rightly, that the vast majority of conservatives in the country get their news from \u2013 and solely from \u2013 Fox. (In a 2020 Pew poll, 65% of Republicans said they trust Fox for political coverage \u2013 30 points higher than any other network; 6 in 10 Republicans said they got their politics and election news from Fox.) The imperial governor. CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston noted recently that DeSantis\u2019 rise puts him on a collision course with Trump. His ability to mold the state government around him is something Trump could only dream of, and that would never work in Washington. Reston wrote: DeSantis\u2019 imperial governorship reached new heights (last week) when the actions of the Florida legislature demonstrated how he is not only bending state government to his will, but also to his whims. In a special session, lawmakers approved a new congressional map proposed by his office that appears all but certain to dilute the voting power of Black Floridians. On the same day, the legislature carried out DeSantis\u2019 threat to punish Disney for speaking out against the law he recently signed that limits certain classroom discussions about sexual orientation and gender identity. I asked CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno, who covers Florida and DeSantis, what we know about how DeSantis might act as president, since a series of recent actions seem designed to stoke divisions. I brought up the election security laws, his \u201cparental rights\u201d campaign that also stokes divisions on LGBTQ rights and the fights he\u2019s picked with big business. Here\u2019s what else Contorno mentioned: Anti-mandate. Beyond reopening Florida before most other states and generally dismissing expert guidance, he also called lawmakers into a special session last year to ban any entity \u2013 from schools to private businesses \u2013 from requiring vaccines and threatened violators with fines. He also banned governments from enacting pandemic mitigation measures, and he has gone after schools that have attempted to require students to wear masks. And he has surrounded himself with people who have pushed questionable Covid-19 remedies and eschewed prevention measures, most notably appointing Dr. Joseph Ladapo as surgeon general. Anti-woke. He has been at the forefront of attacking \u201cwokeness\u201d and critical race theory, signing a new law that bans businesses and schools from teaching about White privilege. His administration also recently rejected math textbooks from publishers, claiming some included elements of critical race theory and emotional and social learning. Anti-tech. Last year, he championed a bill that goes after Big Tech companies for supposedly censoring Trump and other conservative voices, and allows Floridians who feel they are wronged by social media companies a path to sue for retribution. A federal judge blocked the law. Anti-protest. In response to the killing of George Floyd, while other states reviewed policing policies, DeSantis called for and signed a so-called anti-riot bill that opponents said targeted peaceful protesters. A court blocked that law as well. DeSantis has also rejected the entire concept that there was an insurrection at the US Capitol and called the commemoration of January 6 this year \u201cnauseating,\u201d blaming the media for focusing too much on the effort to block counting of the electoral votes. Presidents have more power than just about anybody in the world, but less total control than most people realize. Without a sea change in the Senate, DeSantis \u2013 if elected president \u2013 would have trouble getting much sweeping change accomplished in Washington, just like Biden has and Trump did. But it\u2019s easy to imagine very different uses for the massive federal apparatus if someone with such talent for the politics of division were to assume the office.",

            "article_content": "CNN has obtained 2,319 text messages that former President Donald Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent and received between Election Day 2020 and President Joe Biden\u2019s January 20, 2021 inauguration. The vast trove of texts offers the most revealing picture to date of how Trump\u2019s inner circle, supporters and Republican lawmakers worked behind the scenes to try to overturn the election results and then reacted to the violence that effort unleashed at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. The logs, which Meadows selectively provided to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack, show how the former chief of staff was at the nexus of sprawling conspiracy theories baselessly claiming the election had been stolen. They also demonstrate how he played a key role in the attempts to stop Biden\u2019s certification on January 6. The never-before-seen texts include messages from Trump\u2019s family \u2013 daughter Ivanka Trump, son-in-law Jared Kushner and son Donald Trump Jr. \u2013 as well as White House and campaign officials, Cabinet members, Republican Party leaders, January 6 rally organizers, Rudy Giuliani, My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, Sean Hannity and other Fox hosts. There are also text exchanges with more than 40 current and former Republican members of Congress, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. The texts include everything from plans to fight the election results to surprising and unexpected reactions on January 6 from some of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies. At 2:28 p.m., Greene, the conservative firebrand who had helped to plan the congressional objections that day, texted Meadows with an urgent plea for help as the violence was unfolding at the Capitol. \u201cMark I was just told there is an active shooter on the first floor of the Capitol Please tell the President to calm people This isn\u2019t the way to solve anything,\u201d Greene wrote. Meadows does not appear to reply. More messages flooded in. \u201cMark: he needs to stop this, now. Can I do anything to help?\u201d Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s former acting White House chief of staff, texted Meadows. \u201cIt\u2019s really bad up here on the hill. They have breached the Capitol,\u201d Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk wrote. \u201cThe president needs to stop this ASAP,\u201d texted GOP Rep. William Timmons of South Carolina. \u201cPOTUS is engaging,\u201d Meadows sent in response to Loudermilk. \u201cWe are doing it,\u201d he texted to Timmons. \u201cThanks. This doesn\u2019t help our cause,\u201d Loudermilk replied. Shortly after, Donald Trump Jr. weighed in: \u201cThis his(sic) one you go to the mattresses on. They will try to fuck his entire legacy on this if it gets worse.\u201d \u201cTELL THEM TO GO HOME !!!\u201d texted Trump\u2019s first chief of staff, Reince Priebus. The text messages CNN obtained begin on Election Day, November 3, 2020. Even before the election was called, Meadows was inundated with conspiracy theories about election fraud, strategies to challenge the results and pleas for Trump to keep fighting. The messages \u2013 from GOP activists, donors, Republican members of Congress and state party officials \u2013 appear to act as an echo chamber affirming Trump\u2019s false claims that the election was stolen. For months leading up to Election Day, Trump had claimed the only way he could lose was if the election was rigged. READ: Mark Meadows' texts with Mike Lee and Chip Roy Previously disclosed text messages showed that former Trump administration Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Trump\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., each texted Meadows on November 4 and 5 with ideas for overturning the election. On November 7, hours before the election was called, Perry texted Meadows again: \u201cWe have the data driven program that can clearly show where the fraud was committed. This is the silver bullet.\u201d While Perry has previously denied CNN reporting about his text messages to Meadows, CNN has confirmed it\u2019s his cell phone and he signed this text, \u201cRick Perry,\u201d including his number. Other texts, however, include hints of doubt expressed by members of Trump\u2019s team and even Meadows himself about the veracity of conspiracy theories being spread by Trump\u2019s \u201ckraken\u201d team \u2013 outside attorneys working for Trump that included Giuliani and Sidney Powell. Some key congressional allies who worked with Trump\u2019s campaign initially in its efforts to overturn the election, such as Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, ultimately soured on the approach as the January 6 congressional certification neared, CNN previously reported. The texts also show how Trump allies were quick to deflect responsibility for the January 6 attack. Shortly after pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol, one of his top aides began crafting a counter-narrative. Send a tip:\n\nDo you have information to share about this story? We offer several ways to reach our journalists securely. At 3:45 p.m., Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller suggested to Meadows and Trump aide Dan Scavino that Trump should tweet: \u201cCall me crazy, but ideas for two tweets from POTUS: 1) Bad apples, likely ANTIFA or other crazed leftists, infiltrated today s peaceful protest over the fraudulent vote count. Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! 2) The fake news media who encouraged this summer s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions. This isn\u2019t who we are! Our people should head home and let the criminals suffer the consequences!\u201d Trump\u2019s allies in Congress appeared to get the message. At 3:52 p.m., Greene told Meadows: \u201cMark we don\u2019t think these attackers are our people. We think they are Antifa. Dressed like Trump supporters.\u201d Five minutes later, Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, texted Meadows: \u201cCap Police told me last night they\u2019d been warned that today there\u2019d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent.\u201d In the 16 months since January 6, hundreds of indictments have shown nearly all of those who breached the Capitol were in fact pro-Trump supporters. While Greene was alarmed on January 6, by the next day she was apologizing that the efforts to block Biden\u2019s certification had failed. \u201cYesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I\u2019m sorry nothing worked. I don\u2019t think that President Trump caused the attack on the Capitol. It\u2019s not his fault,\u201d she wrote the morning of January 7. \u201cAbsolutely no excuse and I fully denounce all of it, but after shut downs all year and a stolen election, people are saying that they have no other choice.\u201d Meadows replied, \u201cThanks Marjorie.\u201d Greene is currently facing a legal challenge to disqualify her from running for Congress because of her alleged role in January 6. In court testimony Friday, the Georgia Republican repeatedly deflected or said she didn\u2019t remember what she had said around the events of January 6. The Meadows text logs offer a new glimpse into what she was telling the White House chief of staff in real time. On December 31, Greene reached out to Meadows for advice about how to prepare for objections to certifying the election on January 6. \u201cGood morning Mark, I\u2019m here in DC. We have to get organized for the 6th,\u201d Greene wrote. \u201cI would like to meet with Rudy Giuliani again. We didn\u2019t get to speak with him long. Also anyone who can help. We are getting a lot of members on board. And we need to lay out the best case for each state.\u201d Meadows does not appear to respond. By January 17, Greene was suggesting ways to keep Trump in office, telling Meadows there were several Republicans in Congress who still wanted the then-President to declare martial law, which had been raised in a heated Oval Office meeting a month earlier. Greene texted: \u201cIn our private chat with only Members, several are saying the only way to save our Republic is for Trump to call for Marshall (sic) law. I don\u2019t know on those things. I just wanted you to tell him. They stole this election. We all know. They will destroy our country next. Please tell him to declassify as much as possible so we can go after Biden and anyone else!\u201d Again, Meadows does not appear to respond. Meadows provided the cache of 2,319 messages to the January 6 committee in December 2021. But soon after, he stopped cooperating and refused to appear for a deposition. Ultimately, the House voted to hold the former White House chief of staff in contempt of Congress. The Justice Department has not yet announced whether it will charge Meadows. Meadows has sued the House committee in an attempt to block the congressional subpoenas. And in a late-night court filing on Friday, the committee responded with new details revealing Meadows was warned ahead of time that January 6 could turn violent, according to testimony from Cassidy Hutchison, one of Meadows\u2019 former White House aides. In addition, the committee released text messages Meadows exchanged with Republican members of Congress, including texts with Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania about a scheme to replace Justice Department leaders who opposed Trump\u2019s claims of election fraud. In late December, Perry reached out to Meadows, connecting him to then-DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, who was pushing unfounded claims of voter fraud inside the Justice Department. Trump was considering firing the acting attorney general and installing Clark instead. Clark invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination more than 100 times when he spoke to the January 6 committee in February. Ex-White House official close to Meadows says he was warned January 6 could turn violent On December 26, Perry texted Meadows, \u201cMark, just checking in as time continues to count down. 11 days to 1/6 and 25 days to inauguration. We gotta get going!\u201d \u201cMark, you should call Jeff,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just got off the phone with him and he explained to me why the principal deputy won\u2019t work especially with the FBI. They will view it as as (sic) not having the authority to enforce what needs to be done.\u201d \u201cI got it,\u201d Meadows responded. \u201cI think I understand. Let me work on the deputy position.\u201d On December 28, Perry reached out again: \u201cDid you call Jeff Clark?\u201d Meadows does not appear to respond. Meadows withheld more than 1,000 messages from the committee on claims of privilege, the panel said in Friday\u2019s court filing. In his lawsuit, Meadows\u2019 attorney argued the former White House chief of staff \u201chas been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims.\u201d 'That's not OK': Bash reacts to Hannity's texts to Mark Meadows In addition to the texts the committee has released, CNN and other news organizations have previously published selections of text messages Meadows received from Lee, Roy, Trump Jr., Perry and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife, Ginni Thomas. The logs obtained by CNN include numerous messages from official White House cell phone numbers. Some have been identified by CNN, others are unknown. There are also numerous group texts with Trump\u2019s inner circle. The various group chats include Meadows, Ivanka Trump, Trump Jr. and Kushner, as well as top advisers such as Hope Hicks, campaign manager Bill Stepien, Miller and Scavino, among others. Some texts only include links to news reports and social media. Others appear to contain content that was cut-and-pasted and forwarded. The logs do not contain images or attachments. Meadows\u2019 messages also include dozens of exchanges with Fox hosts, as well as journalists from the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Associated Press, Politico, Bloomberg, NBC, ABC, CBS and CNN. Among Meadows\u2019 most frequent interactions were those with Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity, a well-known friend of Trump. Throughout the logs, Hannity both gives advice and asks for direction. On the afternoon of Election Day, Hannity texted Meadows to ask about turnout in North Carolina. Meadows responded: \u201cStress every vote matters. Get out and vote.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d Hannity replied. \u201cOn it. Any place in particular we need a push.\u201d \u201cPennsylvania. NC AZ,\u201d Meadows wrote. \u201cNevada.\u201d \u201cGot it. Everywhere,\u201d Hannity said. For the most part, Meadows\u2019 texts are short, and frequently he does not appear to reply at all. Some conversations include non sequiturs. It\u2019s unclear whether Meadows did not respond to the messages or if the logs are incomplete, because texts could also have been deleted or withheld for claims of privilege. CNN reached out for comment to all individuals who sent text messages quoted in this story. Meadows and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for the January 6 committee declined to comment. The text messages provide a timeline showing how Trump\u2019s team searched all corners for evidence of election fraud and tried to overturn the election. Beginning on Election Day, Meadows was in the middle of it all, from connecting activists pushing conspiracy theories to strategizing with GOP lawmakers and rally organizers preparing for January 6. The texts also show Meadows was dealing with everything from mediating a fight over who would be on the speaker\u2019s list for the January 6 rally to fielding requests to pay Giuliani\u2019s bills. \u201cSir, we are airborne on the way to Michigan from Arizona. We\u2019re going to need a hotel for the team and two vehicles to pick us up,\u201d Bernie Kerik, a Giuliani associate, texted Meadows on December 1. Reached for comment by CNN, Kerik confirmed the text was his and said that he never received a credit card for those travel expenses, paid for it himself and was later reimbursed. Other texts show Meadows coordinating with GOP activists in the immediate aftermath of the election. \u201cPls get 4 or 5 killers in remaining counts. Need outsiders who will torch the place. Local folks won\u2019t do it. Lawyers and operators. Get us in these states,\u201d American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp texted Meadows on November 4. \u201cI may need to get you and mercy (sic) to go to PA,\u201d Meadows responded, referring to Schlapp\u2019s wife, Mercedes, who is a former Trump White House aide. On a few occasions, Trump family members weighed in. Ivanka Trump sent a note on November 5 to a group that included Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Miller and Meadows: \u201cYou are all WARRIORS of epic proportions! Keep the faith and the fight.\u201d Dozens of Republicans also offered support and advice to Meadows \u2013 as well as perpetuated conspiracy theories that were gaining traction in right-wing media. For instance, Rep. Ted Budd, a North Carolina Republican now running for Senate, suggested in a text on November 7 that Dominion Voting Systems could be connected to George Soros\u2019 company. Dominion has no corporate ties to Soros, a billionaire and frequent target of baseless conspiracy theories, according to a CNN fact check. On November 6, Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, appeared to suggest that state legislatures should appoint electors \u201cin the various states where there\u2019s been shenanigans,\u201d a move he acknowledged would be \u201chighly controversial.\u201d In his text, he wrote the legislatures could appoint \u201ca look doors,\u201d which is phonetically similar to electors. On December 1, then-Attorney General William Barr infuriated Trump when he publicly stated that the Justice Department did not find widespread evidence of voter fraud. Nevertheless, Meadows received multiple texts pushing back, including from Schlapp later that day: \u201cHappy to walk ag through our evidence. Its (sic) overwhelming.\u201d The texts also show Meadows reached out to GOP officials in multiple states to lobby for Trump\u2019s cause. On two occasions, Meadows attempted to contact Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who was under attack from Trump for certifying Georgia\u2019s election for Biden. \u201cmr Secretary. Can you call the White House switchboard,\u201d Meadows wrote on December 5. \u201cYour voicemail is full.\u201d Raffensperger does not appear to reply to the messages. Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election results in Georgia are under investigation by a district attorney in the Atlanta area. Meadows also received text messages from GOP activists and local officials making outlandish claims, including allegations that \u201ctraitors inside our intel agencies\u201d were committing election fraud, as well as baseless charges that voting equipment companies Dominion and Smartmatic had manipulated votes \u2013 the same false claims being pushed by Giuliani and Powell. Both companies have filed billion-dollar lawsuits over the false election claims, including against Fox News, right-wing media organizations, Giuliani, Powell and Lindell. Throughout the two months, Meadows received dozens of messages from Arizona GOP Chairwoman Kelli Ward, who offered what she claimed were examples and sources of voter fraud. On December 9, she sent a text to Meadows letting him know she\u2019d already reached out to Trump\u2019s executive assistant: \u201cThis guy says he\u2019s cracked the whole election fraud and wants to speak to someone. I sent his info to Molly Michael a few days ago, but I\u2019m not sure it went anywhere.\u201d \u201cI will call him,\u201d Meadows responded. Another frequent texter was Lindell, one of the most vocal proponents of baseless election conspiracy theories. Even after courts had dismissed dozens of Trump\u2019s legal challenges, the My Pillow CEO was still pressing the White House. \u201cEverything Sidney has said is true! We have to get the machines and everything we already have proves the President won by millions of votes!\u201d Lindell texted Meadows on December 20. \u201cThis is the biggest cover up of one of the worst crimes in history! I have spent over a million$ to help uncover this fraud and used my platform so people can get the word not to give up!\u201d Meadows replied, \u201cThanks brother. Pray for a miracle.\u201d Reached for comment by CNN, Lindell confirmed the text was his. He told CNN that he has not spoken to Meadows since before January 20, 2021, and that at the time he was \u201cjust trying to get an appointment with the President.\u201d While Trump and his allies publicly stuck by their claims that the election had been stolen, behind the scenes, Trump\u2019s inner circle \u2013 including Meadows \u2013 expressed some doubts. Trump\u2019s aides also questioned whether lawyers like Giuliani and Powell were doing more harm than good. On November 6, Miller, Trump\u2019s campaign spokesman, texted a group, which included Ivanka Trump, Kushner, Hicks, Stepien, Scavino and Meadows, suggesting that the numbers in Philadelphia didn\u2019t back up claims about alleged election fraud there. \u201cOne other key data point: In 2016, POTUS received 15.5% of the vote in Philadelphia County. Today he is currently at 18.3%. So he increased from his performance in 2016. In 2016, Philadelphia County made up 11.3% of the total vote in the state. As it currently stands, Philadelphia County only makes up 10.2% of the statewide vote tally. So POTUS performed better in a smaller share. Sen. (Rick) Santorum was just making this point on CNN - cuts hard against the urban vote stealing narrative,\u201d Miller wrote. A week later, Miller wrote to Meadows again, this time saying that campaign research did not find any evidence of a conspiracy involving Soros, the Democratic donor. Miller also said he was concerned about sharing the findings with Trump. \u201cLots there re: functionality problems, not much there on Dem/Soros conspiracy connections,\u201d Miller wrote on November 13. \u201cWill defer to you on whether or not to share full report with POTUS. POTUS is clearly hyped up on them, not just from his tweets, but he also called me and Justin separately last night to complain. JM.\u201d On November 20, Meadows was asked by a Florida contact how confident he was about fraud related to Dominion. Meadows texted back: \u201cDominion, not that confident. Other fraud. Very confident.\u201d Two days later, Ginni Thomas messaged Meadows with apparent concerns, asking, \u201cTrying to understand the Sidney Powell distancing\u2026\u201d Meadows responded: \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have anything or at least she won\u2019t share it if she does.\u201d \u201cWow!\u201d Ginni Thomas wrote back. In one of the few messages Meadows received from Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law shared a fact check on December 4 debunking one of the most prominent election fraud claims from Georgia. The article showed that despite inflammatory claims of poll workers stashing suitcases filled with ballots under a table, that did not, in fact, occur. After the Electoral College affirmed Biden\u2019s win on December 14, Trump\u2019s allies turned their attention to January 6: the congressional certification of the electors and the rally that Trump said on Twitter \u201cwill be wild!\u201d On December 21, Brooks, the Alabama congressman, wrote to Meadows and others in a group text asking whether he should engage with the media about the \u201cformulation of our January 6 strategies.\u201d \u201cDoes the White House want me to reply or be mum?\u201d Brooks wrote. A staunch Trump ally running for Senate this year, Brooks gave an incendiary speech on January 6 but recently fell out of favor with Trump after suggesting Republicans should move on from 2020. In response to CNN\u2019s request for comment, Brooks said he had \u201cno regrets\u201d about his speech on January 6 and that he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the violence.  \u201cI had no inkling,\u201d Brooks added. Cruz, a Texas Republican who pushed a plan inside the Senate that would have delayed certification of the election, exchanged just a few messages with Meadows \u2013 links to his statements posted to social media. On January 2, the senator sent Meadows his tweet proposing a 10-day audit of the election results. \u201cHere\u2019s the statement,\u201d Cruz wrote. \u201cPerfect,\u201d Meadows responded. The texts also make frequent reference to then-Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to go along with Trump\u2019s plan to try to block the certification on January 6. On December 30, Rep. Brian Babin of Texas expressed concern that congressional leaders might try to short circuit their objections \u2013 and that Pence was not on board. \u201cDems and some Republicans may well try to shortstop our objection efforts. Hoping the VP sticks with us,\u201d Babin wrote. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Miller shared a news article with Meadows that Pence opposed a lawsuit intended to help overturn the election. Miller warned that it could be used \u201cto drive a massive wedge between POTUS and everybody else in the party.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s absolutely going to blow his stack on this if he isn\u2019t already aware,\u201d Miller said of Trump. \u201cOh boy I don\u2019t understand what the VP was thinking here.\u201d On January 5, Jordan, the Ohio congressman and close GOP ally of Meadows, weighed in. \u201cOn January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all \u2013 in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence,\u201d Jordan wrote. Meadows responded the morning of January 6: \u201cI have pushed for this. Not sure it is going to happen.\u201d The January 6 committee included the text exchange in its Friday court filing as evidence of Meadows\u2019 alleged involvement in the effort to overturn the election. The logs also show Meadows was involved with planning the rally on January 6, helping to mediate a fight over the speakers list. Trump adviser Katrina Pierson was alarmed at some of the proposed fringe figures who wanted to speak. On January 2 and 3, Pierson wrote to Meadows looking for help. \u201cGood afternoon, would you mind giving me a call re: this Jan 6th event. Things have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please,\u201d she asked on January 2. The next day, she reached out again: \u201cScratch that, Caroline Wren has decided to move forward with the original psycho list. Apparently Dan Scavino approved??\u201d She continued: \u201cSo, I\u2019m done. I can\u2019t be a part of embarrassing POTUS any further.\u201d Wren was a fundraiser for the Trump campaign and helped organize the January 6 rally. She has been subpoenaed by the January 6 committee. Less than an hour later, Pierson wrote Meadows that she told Wren she was talking to the White House in order to get her to back down. \u201cI let her know that I was going to reach out to WH and her tone changed,\u201d Pierson wrote. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll continue to build a proper event.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d Meadows responded. In the aftermath of the violence at the Capitol on January 6, Trump\u2019s inner circle discussed in a group text how to deal with the fallout \u2013 and Trump\u2019s suspension from Twitter. At 10:10 p.m. on January 6, Kushner texted the group: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we post on his Facebook page since he isn\u2019t locked out there.\u201d In the final days of Trump\u2019s term, as he faced impeachment for a second time, Meadows received words of encouragement from staunch allies, as well as caution from advisers. \u201cI would like to pass to POTUS that we are still with him, I believe in him and I want to encourage him,\u201d Rep. Andrew Clyde, a freshman Georgia Republican, wrote on January 9. \u201cI truly hope he does create a new platform to complete (sic) with Twitter and I hope he calls it \u2018Trumpet\u2019 and then we can send out \u2018notes\u2019 to each other!\u201d \u201cI will share it with him. Thanks Andrew,\u201d Meadows responded. On January 13, the day the House voted to impeach Trump for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol \u2013 with 10 Republicans joining Democrats \u2013 Miller shared polling data in a group text with Meadows, Scavino and Kushner that showed \u201c2/3 of the MAGA base wants us to move on.\u201d \u201cI tried to walk the President through this earlier but he won\u2019t have any of it,\u201d Miller said. As Trump prepared to leave power, he appeared to be a pariah in the Republican Party. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy had said during the House\u2019s January 13 impeachment debate that the outgoing President \u201cbears responsibility\u201d for the riot. Six days later, on January 19, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell denounced Trump from the floor of the Senate, saying the mob that attacked the Capitol was \u201cprovoked by the President and other powerful people.\u201d Nevertheless, Trump\u2019s standing in the Republican Party quickly recovered, especially after McCarthy\u2019s January 28 visit to Mar-a-Lago and the February 2021 acquittal of Trump in the Senate impeachment trial. But before Trump left office, the Meadows text logs show some of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies were dejected. On January 19, in one of the final texts Meadows received as chief of staff, Fox\u2019s Sean Hannity shared a video of McConnell\u2019s floor speech. Hannity texted Meadows: \u201cWell this is as bad as this can get.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles, Tara Subramanian and Christie Johnson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A former Trump White House official close to then-chief of staff Mark Meadows told the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol that the West Wing had been warned the day could turn violent, according to a new court filing. The House has tried to combat Meadows\u2019 refusal to testify in the Capitol Hill investigation. To do that, the House on Friday highlighted statements that hadn\u2019t been previously disclosed from witnesses, such as from Cassidy Hutchinson, the ex-official. The House\u2019s court filing Friday night comes in a case where Meadows has sued to block congressional subpoenas and the House is arguing for legal backing to gather more details about then-President Donald Trump\u2019s interest in overturning the 2020 presidential election result. In the filing, the House released new text messages between Meadows and Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry as a plan was taking shape to overhaul Justice Department leadership. The House also cited startling exchanges between Meadows and the President\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., as well as right-wing hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity, to make its points. The House said the information it has gathered and interviews of witnesses like Hutchinson have allowed it to \u201cidentify with greater precision\u201d what it still wants to ask Meadows, according to the filing. Hutchinson testified that Meadows had been directly warned about the potential for violence on January 6. \u201cI know that people had brought information forward to him that had indicated that there could be violence on the 6th,\u201d she told the committee. \u201cBut, again, I\u2019m not sure if he \u2013 what he did with that information internally,\u201d the committee said she had testified. Hutchinson also testified that she had overheard the White House counsel\u2019s office for Trump say that a plan to use alternate slates of electors to try to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory wasn\u2019t legally sound, according to the filing. Hutchinson also named the campaign officials and lawmakers whom she viewed as advocates of former Vice President Mike Pence not doing his job on January 6 and instead doing \u201canything other than just counting electoral votes.\u201d On the campaign side, Hutchinson named Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, all members of Trump\u2019s legal team who repeatedly laid out a series of false claims and conspiracy theories about alleged voter fraud. Hutchinson named Republican Reps. Perry, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado. The committee has asked Perry and Jordan to speak with the panel voluntarily and both have declined. The House had sought out Hutchinson last year when it subpoenaed a group of former officials with close ties to Trump. Hutchinson was a special assistant for legislative affairs and an adviser to Meadows who was in the White House on January 6 and at the pro-Trump rally at the Ellipse. Hutchinson was also privy to Meadows\u2019 efforts to speak to others about investigating fraud after the election. Also in the Friday night filing, the January 6 committee asked federal Judge Carl Nichols of the DC District Court to make a final decision in the case in the House\u2019s favor, a move that could speed up the court-action timeline and bring to a closure other stalemates between the committee and ex-White House witnesses over executive privilege. The secrecy surrounding the presidency has been used by some allies of Trump to refrain from testifying. It\u2019s also been Meadows\u2019 primary defense, which prompted the House to refer him for possible prosecution to the Justice Department. He has not been charged. A resolution in the lawsuit on whether Meadows is protected by privilege would untangle some issues that could arise if the Justice Department were to charge him with contempt of Congress. Meadows has already turned over extensive documents to the House, including more than 2,300 text messages from his private phone, the committee said on Friday. Previously, the courts fast-tracked a case over the House select committee\u2019s access to Trump-era White House information. Trump lost, with the Supreme Court determining the committee\u2019s needs outweighed executive privilege claims the former President might make over documents held by the National Archives. But there\u2019s no final answer yet on whether administration officials who were close to the former President can be shielded from questioning. The House argued on Friday that no matter Meadows\u2019 position in the West Wing, he should be exempt from special executive branch protections. \u201cHe was not acting as anything like a typical White House Chief of Staff advising the President on official matters of government policy,\u201d the House lawyers wrote. \u201cMr. Meadows was playing a campaign role, attempting to facilitate a strategy that would have reversed the certified results of the 2020 election.\u201d CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon, the onetime adviser to former President Donald Trump who has been charged with contempt of Congress, asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss his criminal case. Among the bevy of reasons Bannon provided for why his case should be dismissed: He said the congressional subpoena he received was invalid because of the makeup of the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and argued that he was \u201ctargeted to send a message.\u201d Bannon also argued that his actions were necessary in order to protect the former President\u2019s ability to shield information under executive privilege claims and insisted he had relied on prior Justice Department guidance related to executive privilege in defying the congressional subpoena. \u201cUnder the circumstances presented here, it would be fundamentally unfair and a clear due process violation to permit this prosecution to go forward,\u201d Bannon\u2019s attorneys wrote in a late Friday court filing. \u201cIt must be dismissed.\u201d Bannon can't use lawyer's advice as defense for not cooperating with House January 6 probe, judge rules Bannon is scheduled to go to trial in July in the criminal contempt-of-Congress case the DOJ has brought against him for not complying with the House January 6 Committee\u2019s subpoena. He has pleaded not guilty. Bannon\u2019s legal team has repeatedly pointed to indications that Trump was looking to assert executive privilege over certain records as an element of Bannon\u2019s defense. \u201cMr. Bannon received actual authority in this case for his non-compliance with the subpoena directly from former President Trump\u2019s invocation of executive privilege and corresponding directive to Mr. Bannon, that Mr. Bannon must honor that invocation with respect to the subpoena,\u201d Bannon\u2019s attorneys wrote in the court filing. Bannon\u2019s late Friday filing comes after he suffered a major setback in his case, which the Justice Department brought in November after he failed to comply with a subpoena issued by the January 6 panel. US District Judge Carl Nichols ruled last week that Bannon could not use as a defense \u2013 should his case go to trial \u2013 evidence that he was following the advice of his attorney in opting not to cooperate with the House probe. On Friday, the Justice Department sought to further limit the evidence Bannon can put up at trial in his defense, asking Bannon\u2019s judge to exclude three new categories of evidence. The DOJ wants excluded its internal opinions and writings laying out the department\u2019s views on whether current or former federal officials can be prosecuted in subpoena disputes in which they raised executive privilege or immunity claims. Bannon obtained those records after securing a discovery order from the judge, though several of the documents were already public and cited in previous Bannon filings. The Justice Department also argued that the internal department documents Bannon has cited so far address scenarios distinct from what Bannon was facing when he chose not to participate in the probe. \u201cThe Defendant was not subpoenaed in relation to his time as an Executive Branch official and he was never directed by the Executive Branch or former President Donald Trump to engage in total noncompliance with the January 6th Select Committee\u2019s (\u2018the Committee\u2019) subpoena as he chose to do,\u201d the filing said. \u201cGiven the evidence\u2019s irrelevance, the Court should exclude it.\u201d Stephen Miller meets virtually with January 6 committee Bannon served as a White House adviser at the beginning of the Trump administration but had been out of the federal government for years before the period the House committee is examining. Shortly after the Justice Department submitted its request to exclude those records, Bannon pointed to the documents in a notice he filed with the court about his intentions to assert an \u201centrapment by estoppel\u201d defense \u2013 meaning an argument that the defendant had been misled by government statements to believe his conduct was legal. In his motion to dismiss, Bannon argued that prior Justice Department guidance is relevant to his case and should offer grounds for dismissal. \u201cThe legal authority that Mr. Bannon relied upon in this case reflects the formal, official, binding, authoritative position of the Department of Justice, the very agency that is prosecuting this case in direct contravention of its own formal, binding, published official policy,\u201d Bannon\u2019s attorneys wrote. The Justice Department also asked the judge to keep out any evidence Bannon seeks to put forward that he had complied with previous subpoenas; according to the department\u2019s account of a presentation Bannon\u2019s lawyer gave to prosecutors before his client was charged, Bannon testified in four previous circumstances \u2013 in the various Russia 2016 election interference  probes \u2013 about his communications with Trump. \u201cJust as the fact that a person did not rob a bank on one day is irrelevant to determining whether he robbed a bank on another, whether the Defendant complied with other subpoenas or requests for testimony \u2013 even those involving communications with the former President \u2013 is irrelevant to determining whether he unlawfully refused to comply with the Committee\u2019s subpoena here,\u201d the DOJ wrote Friday. Finally, the government told the court that Bannon should not be able to argue at his trial that the January 6 Committee\u2019s subpoena of him was invalid because of supposed procedural defects plaguing the panel. Any procedural objections Bannon would seek to raise about the committee\u2019s subpoena are coming too late, the Justice Department argued in its Friday request to limit that defense. January 6 committee to soon receive new documents from National Archives \u201cIt is settled law in the contempt of Congress context that a subpoenaed witness who fails to raise an apparent objection or privilege to a subpoena to the issuing committee has waived it as a defense to contempt,\u201d the government wrote in the court filing. Bannon, meanwhile, filed a request with the court Friday seeking the exclusion of evidence the government obtained from subpoenas it had issued on his lawyer\u2019s phone and email records, as well as from presentations the lawyer gave prosecutors before Bannon was charged. Bannon accused the government of \u201cprosecutorial over-reaching\u201d for seeking information about his lawyer and said the government misled the grand jury, both grounds for dismissal, Bannon\u2019s attorneys argued in the court filing. The pre-trial disputes over evidence will shape the contours of each side\u2019s case. Bannon is just one of four recalcitrant witnesses whom the January 6 Committee referred to the Justice Department for prosecution but the only one so far to face a criminal prosecution for his failure to comply with a committee subpoena. How his case unfolds will reverberate as other potential witnesses weigh whether or not to cooperate with the congressional investigation. This story and headline have been updated.",

            "article_content": "Former Trump White House adviser  Stephen Miller on Thursday testified virtually for roughly eight hours before the House select committee investigating the US Capitol insurrection, a source familiar with the meeting told CNN. \u201cIt got a little chippy,\u201d the source said, suggesting Miller was at times a difficult witness. Some executive privilege issues came up during the meeting, the source added. Miller is under subpoena by the committee and had resisted attempts to appear, including by suing to block the committee from forcing him to hand over documents and meet for an interview. In its subpoena of Miller, the committee cited the role he had played in sharing false claims of voter fraud related to the 2020 election. The Associated Press first reported on Miller\u2019s planned testimony. The committee declined to comment. The interview comes after two Trump White House lawyers appeared before the committee: former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy Patrick Philbin. A source told CNN that former President Donald Trump authorized Cipollone\u2019s testimony to the panel. Cipollone is a key player in the 2020 election saga because he pushed back against some of Trump\u2019s more egregious attempts to overturn the results. Miller is among the former Trump officials who could provide the committee with details about what was happening inside the White House on, and leading up to, January 6, 2021. In its subpoena letter to Miller late last year, the committee noted that he, by his own account, \u201cparticipated in efforts to spread false information about alleged voter fraud in the November 2020 election, as well as efforts to encourage state legislatures to alter the outcome of the November 2020 election by appointing alternate slates of electors.\u201d Miller and his team also helped prepare for Trump\u2019s remarks prior to the riot at the Ellipse on January 6, 2021, had been at the White House that day and was with the President when he spoke at the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, the committee added. Miller is just the latest senior Trump official to appear before the committee. Ivanka Trump, the former President\u2019s daughter and former senior adviser, sat for an hours-long interview in recent weeks. Her husband, Jared Kushner, also voluntarily appeared before the committee. This headline and story have been updated with additional reporting Thursday.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol Hill insurrection has conducted more than 860 depositions and interviews, with dozens more scheduled in the coming weeks, a committee aide told CNN on Tuesday. The panel continues to hear from witnesses on a daily basis, the aide added, underscoring how the committee is still collecting testimony as it moves into a critical stage of its investigation. In addition to witness interviews and depositions, the committee has received nearly 10,000 documents, according to the aide. It is also following up on more than 460 tips received through the panel\u2019s tip line, the aide added. Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, previously handed over thousands of records before ultimately refusing to cooperate further. Those text messages continue to be a resource for the committee, and new details about their contents continue to emerge. CNN first reported last week that included in the tranche of texts was a November 5, 2020, message from Donald Trump Jr. to Meadows laying out ideas for keeping his father in power by subverting the Electoral College process. Committee members have consistently emphasized that they have obtained crucial evidence through these witness interviews and documents, allowing them to piece together what happened on as well as leading up to January 6. \u201cWe\u2019re triangulating basically from a lot of different angles, and we are getting a fulsome picture of what happened in the run-up to and on the day of January 6,\u201d Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida told CNN+ late last month. While a handful of close aides to former President Donald Trump refused to comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena requests, hundreds of other witnesses have cooperated, either voluntarily or under legal order. Among those who have cooperated voluntarily with the committee\u2019s investigation are members of Trump\u2019s own family. Ivanka Trump, the former President\u2019s daughter and a former White House senior adviser, met with the committee for close to eight hours last week, two sources familiar with the interview previously told CNN. The sources would not provide details about the voluntary interview other than to say that Trump was generally cooperative. In addition to being one of Donald Trump\u2019s closest advisers, Ivanka Trump had a unique perch from which she saw the events of January 6, 2021. She was with her father most of the day, and she was in the Oval Office for key meetings. The committee has heard testimony from other White House officials who recounted Ivanka Trump being in the room during a phone call her father had with then-Vice President Mike Pence. Her husband Jared Kushner has also met with the committee. The committee also continues to receive new documents, including specific emails from John Eastman \u2013 the lawyer who masterminded Trump\u2019s apparent strategy to overturn the election. Last month, a judge ordered Eastman to turn over more than 100 specific emails he had tried to shield. The judge rejected Eastman\u2019s attorney-client privilege argument and ruled the public must know the content of these emails to prevent another plot. Eastman and Trump\u2019s campaign to overturn a democratic election was \u201cunprecedented in American history,\u201d the judge wrote, calling it \u201ca coup in search of a legal theory.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The House voted Wednesday to recommend two former advisers to former President Donald Trump be referred to the Department of Justice on criminal contempt of Congress charges. The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol Hill riot is looking to hold Trump White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and Trump\u2019s onetime trade adviser Peter Navarro in contempt of Congress for their refusal to cooperate with the panel\u2019s investigation or appear for their respective scheduled depositions. The House vote was 220-203. Just two Republicans \u2013 Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois \u2013 voted for the resolution. The pair also serve on the January 6 committee. \u201cBoth of these men have refused to comply with the Select Committee\u2019s subpoenas in any way,\u201d Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, testified in front of the House Rules Committee on Monday. Scavino used a series of delay tactics to prevent any type of substantive cooperation with its investigation, according to the committee, which argues he never substantively engaged and therefore was in violation of his subpoena. Scavino is one of Trump\u2019s closest and most loyal allies, having served in the administration from beginning to end and as one of his earliest campaign staffers. He was intimately involved with Trump\u2019s social media channels, often posting message to Trump\u2019s followers on the then-President\u2019s behalf. The committee believes Scavino is privy to meetings and details of the events leading up to and on January 6, 2021, including strategy sessions that were directly tied to Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. The committee has cited news stories that discuss Scavino tracking the website \u201cTheDonald.win,\u201d which their report describes as an \u201conline forum frequented by individuals who openly advocated and planned violence in the weeks leading up to January 6th.\u201d Scavino has still contested his need to testify, according to a letter from his attorney Stanley Brand to the White House on March 25, which Brand provided to CNN on Sunday. The letter kicked legal questions back to the Biden administration, which had determined it would not protect any of Scavino\u2019s testimony. Scavino, however, has argued the law isn\u2019t settled yet on whether the current President can waive privilege on all testimony, including Scavino\u2019s conversations with Trump, especially if Trump may make a claim to secrecy of his own. The committee has accused Navarro, a former White House trade adviser, of making no effort to comply with its subpoena request, claiming that Navarro made it clear that he was unable to cooperate because Trump had asserted executive privilege in the matter. The committee has argued against Navarro\u2019s use of executive privilege, citing for example that many of the topics it wanted to discuss with him he had already written about in great detail in his book. Navarro said in a statement following Wednesday\u2019s vote, \u201cPresident Trump has asserted executive privilege, it is not my privilege to waive, and the appropriate course of action would have been for the Committee to negotiate this matter directly with the president as I directed them do.\u201d Navarro has been very public about his attempts to work with the Trump campaign to subvert the 2020 election. In his book, he details a plan called the \u201cGreen Bay Sweep,\u201d which involved convincing state leaders in several swing states to call into question the election results in an attempt to delay and eventually prevent the certification. In a previous statement to CNN, Navarro responded to the committee\u2019s contempt report filing by saying he believes President Joe Biden does not have the ability to waive Trump\u2019s executive privilege in his case. He also claimed that the committee\u2019s investigation is predicated on a false notion that the 2020 presidential election was \u201cfree and fair.\u201d \u201cMy position remains this is not my Executive Privilege to waive and the Committee should negotiate this matter with President Trump,\u201d Navarro said in a statement. \u201cIf he waives the privilege, I will be happy to comply; but I see no effort by the Committee to clarify this matter with President Trump, which is bad faith and bad law.\u201d Cheney, who serves as vice chair on the committee, said on Tuesday, \u201cThere is no standard under law by which you can simply say \u2018I\u2019m not coming because somebody told me not to,\u2019 even if that person is the former President of the United States.\u201d Now that the referrals have passed out of the House, they will be sent to the Department of Justice, which will decide if there is enough evidence to prosecute. The committee has advanced three previous criminal referrals. The first referral from the House, for former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, was picked up by the Justice Department and has led to an indictment of Bannon. He faces a criminal trial this summer. The Justice Department is still reviewing the contempt referral of former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, which the full House voted on in December. Scavino was initially subpoenaed at the same time as Bannon and Meadows. A third contempt referral, for former DOJ staffer Jeffrey Clark, was voted out of committee but did not make it to the House floor after Clark agreed to meet with the committee. Clark sat for an interview but pleaded the Fifth Amendment more than 100 times. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. News out of Ukraine, where citizens are taking up arms to defend their democracy from an invading Russian army, has distracted Americans, for a time, from the investigation into the attempt to overturn democracy here at home. But the House January 6 committee appears to be very busy in its pursuit of accountability for the US Capitol riot, even as it may be running short on time. On Tuesday, The Washington Post and CBS News reported that a gap of more than seven hours exists in the logs of phone calls placed to or from Donald Trump on January 6, 2021, that were turned over to the House committee. CNN had previously reported that records were missing regarding the calls. This leaves congressional investigators with holes in their understanding so far of what transpired that day, but a member of the House January 6 committee has said the panel will ultimately get the information it is seeking. \u201cWe\u2019re triangulating basically from a lot of different angles, and we are getting a fulsome picture of what happened in the run-up to and on the day of January 6,\u201d Democratic Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida told CNN+ on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the federal criminal probe into January 6, which operates separately from the congressional inquiry, has expanded. Multiple sources tell CNN that federal criminal investigators have widened the investigation to gather information about fundraising and organizing for the political rally held in Washington immediately before Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, as well as the effort to subvert the 2020 Electoral College vote count with alternate slates of fake electors for Trump in swing states he lost. Here are some of the other recent developments: Trump, more likely than not, broke the law. A federal judge in California said Monday that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that the former President broke the law in trying to disrupt the counting of electoral votes on January 6. Key emails must be turned over. The judge, David Carter, also ordered John Eastman \u2013 the lawyer who masterminded Trump\u2019s apparent strategy to overturn the election \u2013 to turn over more than 100 specific emails Eastman had tried to shield. Carter rejected Eastman\u2019s attorney-client privilege argument and ruled the public must know the content of these emails to prevent another plot. Eastman and Trump\u2019s campaign, the judge wrote, \u201cwas a coup in search of a legal theory.\u201d Interest in Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 wife, Ginni. The House committee will seek an interview with the activist wife of the conservative Supreme Court justice. Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas was in contact with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows before January 6, feeding him conspiracy theories and pushing to find a way to overturn the election. She has also admitted to attending a pro-Trump rally on January 6, but denies taking part in the riot. Clarence Thomas was the only dissenting justice when the Supreme Court rejected Trump\u2019s effort to shield White House documents from the committee. Kushner met with the committee. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and former senior adviser Jared Kushner voluntarily gave testimony on Thursday. Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, a member of the panel, told CNN that Kushner \u201cvolunteered information\u201d during his testimony but she would not go into specifics of what he said. A source familiar with the deposition told CNN the interview lasted more than six hours. A similar appearance could be in the works for Kushner\u2019s wife and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka. Contempt referrals for Scavino and Navarro. Separately, the committee voted unanimously Monday evening to recommend that two former Trump advisers, onetime deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and trade adviser Peter Navarro, be referred to the Justice Department on criminal contempt of Congress charges. The referrals head next to the full House for a vote, where Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has committed to bringing them forward \u201cas soon as the schedule permits.\u201d These votes could lead to prosecution by the Department of Justice, as was the case for Steve Bannon. No charges yet for Meadows. The House voted in December to refer Meadows for a contempt charge, but the DOJ hasn\u2019t yet followed up. Meadows, by the way, is facing a separate investigation alongside his wife in North Carolina for registering to vote in 2020 at an address where they never lived. Some frustrated January 6 committee Democrats had a clear message to the Justice Department Monday night: Do your job. But the biggest news Monday was the California federal court opinion. It\u2019s clear the House committee is working hard to build a complete picture of what led up to the riot that interrupted the counting of electoral votes. What\u2019s not clear is what sort of additional accountability there may be. CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz notes that in the case involving Eastman\u2019s emails, lawyers for the committee have all but invited the Justice Department to consider criminal charges, although there\u2019s no indication that is happening. Here are some of the thoughts Polantz sent on Monday when I asked her what to make of the latest developments. What is the committee doing in court? POLANTZ: They\u2019re still trying to get to the heart of what happened between Donald Trump and his closest allies leading up to the January 6 insurrection, and one way to do that is lay out evidence in a court case like this, where the House was seeking closely guarded records. This isn\u2019t a criminal case where they need to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt. But they did just convince a judge that Trump does appear to have been planning the felony of obstructing Congress, and using his lawyers to make that crime happen. And so they should get the records. How big a win is this for the committee? POLANTZ: It\u2019s win-win-win for the House. They are going to get the zealously protected documents; they get the federal judge\u2019s endorsement that their investigation is worth it; and they\u2019ve packaged so much information and argument together that the Justice Department very well may want to take a look. This Eastman case so far has been serving up a legal meal for DOJ, even more so than shaming or harnessing congressional political pressure. What did we learn from Judge Carter\u2019s opinion? POLANTZ: One of the startling parts of Carter\u2019s opinion is how he, too, concludes there\u2019s a need for investigation and accountability. This is a well-respected judge \u2013 a Clinton appointee and former Marine who received a Purple Heart for bravery in the Vietnam War \u2013 going beyond what was necessary for his legal decision, to make this call to action. \u201cIf Dr. Eastman and President Trump\u2019s plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself,\u201d the judge wrote. This is another branch of government calling for more to be done to respond to January 6. What comes next? POLANTZ: The House\u2019s powers are limited; remember, they\u2019ve already impeached Trump and the Senate refused to convict. And their investigation will always have more limitations on the evidence they can gather than what a criminal investigation could pursue. So Carter doesn\u2019t say outright the DOJ and other courts should be dealing with accountability too, but his subtext is clear. It\u2019s important to remember the political reality that Democrats, with their oh-so-slim majority, could very well lose control of the House in November\u2019s midterm elections. If Republicans do win more seats in the election, they would take control and certainly end the committee in January. While this month has seen a lot of activity, there are many loose ends to track. Bannon\u2019s trial for contempt of Congress won\u2019t get underway until July. Meadows has not even been indicted, and the Justice Department may choose not to take up the contempt charge against him. The committee already has his text messages from around the election, so his testimony may be less important. If the House refers Scavino and Navarro for contempt charges, their trials, if pursued by the Justice Department, could take place later. The committee\u2019s final report, which is expected to seek to build a compelling narrative, could in turn build public support for the DOJ to pursue charges against Trump or his inner circle even if Democrats lose the House. And the expansion of the Justice Department\u2019s criminal probe into the political rally and fake electors represents a new stage of the investigation, CNN reports. It comes as Attorney General Merrick Garland faces increasing political pressure to examine possible wrongdoing by people in Trump\u2019s orbit. Garland told NPR early in March that the government will move slowly and methodically, but pursue all possible criminal cases. \u201cParticularly federal prosecutors, we begin with the cases that are right in front of us with overt actions, and then we build from there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is a process that we will continue to build until we hold everyone accountable who committed criminal acts with respect to January 6.\u201d He said prosecutors will not avoid bringing cases against officials if that\u2019s where the evidence leads them. \u201cWe are not avoiding cases that are political or cases that are controversial or sensitive. What we are avoiding is making decisions on a political basis, on a partisan basis,\u201d he said. They\u2019ll have until 2026 to consider charges. Despite those assurances from Garland, prosecuting someone like Trump would clearly be a difficult process. Separate from the federal government and whether Trump tried to upend the election, an inquiry into the former President\u2019s business by the Manhattan DA also appears to have stalled. Two senior prosecutors in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office resigned in February after Bragg stopped the process of presenting evidence to a grand jury and told the lawyers he wasn\u2019t prepared to authorize an indictment against Trump. There is also a county-level investigation in Georgia into whether Trump and White House officials tried to overturn election results there. The case continues quietly, and a grand jury is expected to hear evidence from Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in May. The backdrop for all of this is that Trump, having twice beaten impeachment convictions, is looking very much like a 2024 presidential candidate \u2013 and one who could win at that.

            "article_content": "Chief Justice John Roberts has long trumpeted the Supreme Court\u2019s institutional integrity, saying the nine justices differ from elected politicians and calling out anyone who threatens to undermine that message. He has rebuked former President Donald Trump and members of Congress. But now the threat comes from within, and Roberts faces a dilemma. The chief justice is not the boss of Justice Clarence Thomas or any of the associate justices. Each decides when to recuse himself or herself from a case and no internal process exists to sanction a justice\u2019s failure to sit out a case. When recusal occurs, rarely is a reason made public. What to know about the Justice Clarence Thomas recusal debate around his wife's texts Further, Thomas\u2019 stature has been enhanced in recent years by the new conservative appointees. He enjoys a personal loyalty among the right wing that has eluded Roberts. Thomas is now fueling an ethics controversy affecting the reputation of the entire court. He did not recuse himself from cases involving the 2020 election and January 6, 2021, rampage at the Capitol, although \u2013 it has since emerged \u2013 his wife, Ginni, was strategizing with the Trump White House to reverse the election results. This latest twist in the January 6 investigation has highlighted the justices\u2019 lack of transparency regarding recusals and their vague ethical standards. An emotional week of Senate hearings for Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to succeed retiring Justice Stephen Breyer brought questions about the court\u2019s stature into the spotlight. The Thomas controversy also arises as the justices are roiled behind the scenes on cases over abortion rights and gun control. They have increasingly let animosities toward one another spill out in opinions. Decisions expected through the end of the current session, in late June, will inevitably split the country and deepen concerns about the court\u2019s integrity. Roberts has been part of the rightward shift of the Supreme Court, yet he has been intensely concerned about the court\u2019s institutional reputation and has tried to slow the conservative juggernaut. He is likely to want to generate as much public confidence as possible as the session closes. He has labored since his 2005 appointment, and especially during the Trump tenure, to separate the bench from politics. Yet he appears destined to be entangled with the former President, especially in the aftermath of Trump\u2019s attempts to steal the election and of January 6. In this new situation involving a fellow justice, there clearly is some expectation from congressional Democrats that Roberts can \u2013 and will \u2013 act. \u201cI think Chief Justice Roberts ought to demand a public explanation from Justice Thomas, and he must absolutely recuse himself,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, said on Monday. Ketanji Brown Jackson courts Republicans, though Romney likely won't make decision known until 'day of the vote' Any action would surely inspire Thomas\u2019 own political constituency, who have celebrated his consistent 30 years of conservative opinions and believe he should be a model for other justices. \u201cJustice Thomas is a great American and an outstanding Justice. I have total confidence in his brilliance and impartiality in every aspect of the work of the Court,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said in a statement last week. Roberts, by contrast, lacks such support from leading Republicans. His 2012 vote to uphold Obamacare and other moves toward the middle of the bench have engendered distrust among partisans on the right. Despite his elevated title, Roberts has little real authority with his colleagues. He controls the assignment power of cases when he is in the majority and oversees the running of the building. But each justice is appointed for life and can be removed only through impeachment. In 2011, as he broadly addressed potential recusals, Roberts said he had \u201ccomplete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted.\u201d Ginni Thomas\u2019 activities, however, represent a wholly new order of business. They were tied to litigation efforts to upend the 2020 election. Trump\u2019s game plan was to reach the Supreme Court. Text messages obtained by CNN show that Ginni Thomas pleaded with then-Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to fight to overturn the election results. She offered suggestions for legal strategy and in one November text after the election told Meadows, \u201cYou are the leader, with him, who is standing for America\u2019s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\u201d Trump brazenly asks Putin to release dirt about Biden's family Clarence Thomas voted in cases arising from the 2020 election. He also stood out in one February 2021 opinion as he expressed support, writing alone, for the claim that election fraud is a threat to America. In January 2022, he was alone again in publicly dissenting from the majority\u2019s decision to let the National Archives release Trump White House documents \u2013 including those involving Meadows \u2013 to the House January 6 committee, over the former President\u2019s attempt to assert executive privilege. Ginni Thomas has acknowledged attending the Trump rally on January 6 before Trump demonstrators marched toward the US Capitol. She said she had gone home early and was not with the Capitol rioters. She has declined to comment on the recent text-message revelations. Neither Clarence Thomas nor Roberts responded to CNN requests for comment. Should Justice Thomas recuse self over wife's Jan. 6 texts? While Roberts has no control over his colleagues, he would presumably have some moral authority inside the court. He might, if so inclined, privately approach Thomas to discuss ways to ensure public confidence in his recusal decisions. Roberts might also try to persuade his colleagues to adopt a formal ethics code for the high court. Justice Elena Kagan told a House committee in March 2019 that Roberts was considering such action. But the matter faded after that. The chief justice has said they generally abide by the ethics code that covers lower court judges. Separately, the justices are bound by a federal law that says they should disqualify themselves from cases if their \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Whether that law could ever be enforced against the justices has never been tested. As an internal matter, Roberts said the justices do not \u201csit in judgment\u201d of individual decisions whether to recuse in a case. That was the posture of Roberts\u2019 predecessor in a 2004 episode, when Justice Antonin Scalia refused to disqualify himself from a case involving Vice President Dick Cheney after they had gone duck hunting together in Louisiana. When Senate leaders asked Chief Justice William Rehnquist in a letter about the court\u2019s recusal rules, Rehnquist wrote that \u201cno formal procedure\u201d exists for review of a justice\u2019s recusal decision in an individual case. \u201cThis is because it has long been settled that each justice must decide such a question for himself,\u201d Rehnquist added. Today, it just so happens that Cheney\u2019s daughter Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, is vice chair of the January 6 committee. Scalia jokes about hunting with Cheney Committee sources revealed this week that they will seek an interview with Ginni Thomas over the texts that show her asking Meadows to intensify the effort to block Biden\u2019s victory. The late Scalia, for his part in 2004, answered a specific recusal request in that case with a 21-page statement that declared, \u201cSince I do not believe my impartiality can reasonably be questioned, I do not think it would be proper for me to recuse.\u201d He said that as he and Cheney had hunted, they were \u201cnever in the same blind, and never discussed the case.\u201d He acknowledged that he had flown down to Louisiana on Air Force Two but said he\u2019d had to take a costly return flight home and retorted, \u201cIf it is reasonable to think that a Supreme Court justice can be bought so cheap, the Nation is in deeper trouble than I had imagined.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The White House will not assert executive privilege over Jared Kushner\u2019s testimony to the committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection, White House communications director Kate Bedingfield said Tuesday. \u201cObviously, the President has spoken to the fact that January 6 was one of the darkest days in our country\u2019s history and that we must have a full accounting of what happened to ensure that it never occurs again, and he\u2019s been quite clear that they posed a unique threat to our democracy and that the constitutional protections of executive privilege should not be used to shield from Congress or the public information about an attack on the Constitution itself,\u201d Bedingfield told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins. \u201cAnd so, as a result the White House has decided not to assert executive privilege over the testimony of Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump.\u201d Bedingfield declined to offer details on if the White House had conveyed as much to Kushner\u2019s legal team, adding, \u201cI won\u2019t speak to private communication between our attorneys and his.\u201d Kushner, the son-in-law and former senior adviser to then-President Donald Trump, is expected to voluntarily appear before the panel in a virtual meeting Thursday. This position from President Joe Biden\u2019s White House isn\u2019t new with regards to Trump-era witnesses and documents. The White House has refused to assert a need for secrecy in response to most House requests related to January 6. CNN reported last month that Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who is married to Kushner and also served as senior White House adviser, was in discussions with the House select committee to voluntarily appear for an interview, her spokesperson and two sources familiar with the probe confirmed to CNN at the time. The committee is specifically interested in speaking with Ivanka about what she witnessed or did in the hour or so between when the march to the Capitol started and when the then-President tweeted that then-Vice President Mike Pence denied his request and certified the 2020 election results, which rioters have attested in court had a direct correlation to when violence at the Capitol increased. Kushner\u2019s meeting is coming at a significant moment for the committee when its investigation is making progress on multiple fronts. The panel is also seeking an interview with Ginni Thomas, the conservative activist and wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, following revelations that she texted with former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows in an effort to overturn the election. Additionally, a federal judge said Monday that Donald Trump and right-wing attorney John Eastman may have been planning a crime as they sought to disrupt the January 6 congressional certification of the presidential election. The judge in California ordered Eastman to turn over 101 emails from around January 6, 2021, that he has tried to keep secret from the House select committee investigating the US Capitol attack. Ultimately, the select committee is planning to produce a multi-media presentation and hire a writer as part of its effort to turn its largely secretive work into a compelling narrative, multiple sources tell CNN. The online multi-media presentation, which would include links to key video evidence, would be in addition to a traditional written report, a source familiar with the committee\u2019s work previously told CNN. Presenting its information in a comprehensive and engaging way will be crucial to creating a convincing argument for potential legislative changes as well as possible criminal referrals.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to steal the 2020 election is being revealed week-by-week to be deeper and broader than it initially appeared, sharpening the national dilemma of if and how he could ever be held to account. Even as a federal judge commented Monday that Trump \u201cmore likely than not\u201d sought to commit a crime to stay in office last year, the ex-President\u2019s attacks on democracy are intensifying. They were on display as recently as Saturday night in a lie-filled rally that underscored how his conspiracy to overturn the election \u2013 whether it is criminal or not \u2013 remains viscerally alive and able to damage future elections. While much of the country has been transfixed by Russia\u2019s brutal war in Ukraine, the House committee investigating the insurrection has been racing against the clock ticking down to its own likely demise if Republicans win back the House in November\u2019s midterms. It took another step on Monday toward holding two former Trump advisers to account by advancing criminal contempt referrals. There's a lot of activity in the January 6 committee's investigation On Tuesday, The Washington Post and CBS News reported that a gap of more than seven hours exists in the logs of phone calls placed to or from Trump on January 6 that were turned over to the House committee. CNN had previously reported that records were missing regarding the calls. It\u2019s extraordinary that, more than 14 months on, new details of efforts by Trump and those around him to subvert President Joe Biden\u2019s victory are still emerging. It\u2019s also ironic that this threat to American democracy is being further exposed while Washington leads an international effort to save freedom in Ukraine, which is under much greater assault from Russian President Vladimir Putin, whom Trump still seems to hero worship. Here at home, a flurry of new details in recent days about the ex-President\u2019s behavior justifies continued investigations into the worst attack on American democracy in decades. Those revelations also explain why pro-Trump Republicans were so keen to prevent the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021, from ever getting off the ground. And they inject a new political dimension into Trump\u2019s attempted comeback as he casts the 2022 midterm elections as a referendum on the lie that he won in 2020 and seeks to build a return to the White House on the same falsehoods that have drawn in millions of his supporters. In one development on Monday that alone encapsulated the stunning events of the last election still hanging over the country, a federal judge wrote that it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Trump \u201ccorruptly attempted to obstruct\u201d Congress in its certification of Biden\u2019s election victory. Judge David Carter\u2019s comment came as he ruled that emails from John Eastman, a conservative lawyer who helped craft Trump\u2019s false argument that the 2020 election was stolen, should be handed over to the committee. Judge: 'More likely than not' that Trump 'corruptly attempted' to block Congress from counting votes on January 6 Carter can\u2019t initiate a case against Trump. But his words didn\u2019t just raise a blaring historical marker over a President committing a potential crime in office \u2013 and one that put the entire US democratic system at risk. His comment re-focused attention on the debate within the House committee over whether to make what would be a historic criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department. Such a move would present Attorney General Merrick Garland with the earthshaking decision of whether to prosecute an ex-President who is maneuvering with a $100 million war chest in a potential bid to reclaim his job in 2024. There could be few hotter political potatoes for an attorney general already facing political pressure to deal with Trump aides who are obstructing the committee. Failing to pursue Trump in such circumstances would send a signal of impunity for presidents who seek to destroy American democratic institutions, even as Trump\u2019s supporters who ransacked the US Capitol begin to be convicted and face prison terms for apparently acting on their political hero\u2019s wishes. But moving against Trump would ensure that the dark history of the 2020 election continues to dominate American politics for years to come because it would offer the ex-President new material for his claims that he\u2019s persecuted by the political establishment. Tapping into that theme on Monday, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich slammed Carter\u2019s ruling as \u201cjust another example of how the left is weaponizing every branch of government against President Trump.\u201d But the panel hit back. Donald Trump's legal problems aren't going away \u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion also includes a warning: that a failure to pursue accountability could set the stage for a repeat of January 6th,\u201d Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said in a statement on Monday. \u201cAmerica must not allow what happened on that day to be minimized and cannot accept as normal these threats to our democracy,\u201d they said, clearly trying to emphasize the enduring relevance of the Capitol riot as the political clock races on. Monday\u2019s developments rocked Washington as it was still coming to terms with the implications of last week\u2019s revelations that Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, had aggressively tried to support Trump\u2019s attempts to cling to power in late 2020 and early 2021. There\u2019s no indication her husband was involved in attempts to subvert a legal election. January 6 Committee will seek interview with Ginni Thomas, sources say But the reputation of the Supreme Court relies on the assumption of impartiality and avoiding any appearance of ethical issues. This issue has now dragged the top bench directly into the aftermath of January 6, an outrage that is tainting every branch of the American government. And it came as Republican senators spent last week smearing Biden\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, with misleading claims she was soft on child pornography offenders, which could damage her reputation among some voters for years to come. Ironically, many of those same senators were among Trump\u2019s most fervent enablers and apologists when he tore at the rule of law in the White House. Multiple sources said Monday that the committee will seek an interview with Ginni Thomas over texts in its possession that show her pleading with then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to double down on efforts to block Biden\u2019s victory. \u201cWe want to hear from everybody who has something to say,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who serves on the committee, told CNN on Monday. \u201cAnd she obviously interacted frequently with the president\u2019s chief of staff and was actively involved with the effort to overturn the election. So, speaking as one member, I think it\u2019s important that we hear from her.\u201d Carter delivered a fresh victory for the January 6 committee, which signaled on Monday it\u2019s moving ahead in its investigation. In ordering the handover of 101 emails held by Eastman from around January 6, 2021, the judge revealed new details about the documents the House panel can receive \u2013 including one that appears to be aiding Trump and Eastman\u2019s alleged conspiracy to obstruct Congress: a draft memo written for another Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani, recommending that Vice President Mike Pence reject some states\u2019 electors during the January 6 congressional meeting. Eastman was instrumental in crafting the plan for Pence to refuse to certify the election results in Congress based on false claims, disproven in court, that there had been massive fraud against Trump. Eastman \u201cintends to comply with the court\u2019s order,\u201d his attorney Charles Burnham said. January 6 committee sends message to DOJ as it recommends criminal contempt charges for 2 more Trump advisers: Do your job But the Eastman angle is only one front on which the committee is pushing ahead. The ex-President\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House adviser, Jared Kushner, is expected to voluntarily speak to the committee this week. And the committee voted Monday night to send to the full House a referral for criminal contempt regarding former Trump advisers Peter Navarro and Dan Scavino, both of whom rebuffed the panel. Assuming the full House supports the referral, it will again be up to Garland to decide whether to move toward prosecutions. While the Justice Department did open a case against former Trump political guru Steve Bannon, who goes to trial in the summer, it has yet to weigh in on a similar contempt case against Meadows, who may have a far stronger executive privilege ground for refusing to testify. Garland\u2019s challenge shows that while the committee can make big symbolic moves, its capacity to force testimony may be limited ahead of its expected public hearings later this spring. Some Democrats on the committee called on the Justice Department to do more to hold those Trump aides who refuse to testify to account through prosecution. Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California warned: \u201cThis committee is doing its job. The Department of Justice needs to do theirs.\u201d Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia called on the department to act swiftly, and showed real frustration with Garland. \u201cI will echo what my colleagues have already said, but more bluntly, Attorney General Garland, do your job \u2013 so that we can do ours.\u201d Such frustrations raise the question of the committee\u2019s broader impact. Millions of Americans who support the ex-President have already shown themselves willing to buy into denials of what happened on January 6, which have been advanced by Trump\u2019s GOP acolytes. But even though the committee, which has interviewed hundreds of witnesses and appears to have a stark story to tell, cannot itself bring Trump to justice, it can influence public opinion with its final report and public hearings. If it succeeds in capturing the attention of the American people, it will implicitly ask voters whether they have the stomach for more years of lies from an ex-President who clearly lost an election that he insists he won.

            "article_content": "Members of the House select committee investigating the insurrection at the US Capitol voiced their frustration with Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Department of Justice on Monday, as they voted unanimously to recommend two former advisers to former President Donald Trump be referred to the department on criminal contempt of Congress charges. The message to Garland and DOJ, which has still not said whether it will pursue criminal charges against former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows for defying a congressional subpoena, was clear: Do your job. \u201cThis committee is doing its job. The Department of Justice needs to do theirs,\u201d committee member Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, said during Monday\u2019s business meeting. The panel voted to recommend Trump White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and Trump\u2019s onetime trade adviser, Peter Navarro, for criminal contempt charges for their refusal to cooperate with the committee\u2019s investigation or appear for a scheduled deposition. Virginia Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria said that \u201cthe Department of Justice must act swiftly,\u201d adding, \u201cI will echo what my colleagues have already said, but more bluntly: Attorney General Garland, do your job \u2013 so that we can do ours.\u201d That message to DOJ was only amplified by committee Chair Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, casting the committee\u2019s probe as a struggle for the future of democracy. Referencing the ongoing invasion of Ukraine in her opening remarks, Cheney warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s actions remind \u201cus what happens when authoritarians rule.\u201d The panel\u2019s vote Monday night on Scavino and Navarro came after the committee filed reports Sunday night outlining the ways in which both men evaded investigators. The referrals head next to the full House for a vote, where House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer has committed to bringing them forward \u201cas soon as the schedule permits.\u201d If both pass out of the House, the referrals would then be sent to the Department of Justice, which will decide if there is enough evidence to prosecute. The committee has advanced three previous criminal referrals. Cheney at the meeting drew a direct parallel between the panel\u2019s work to hold Trump accountable and the Russian invasion of Ukraine \u2013 casting the House investigation as essential to the future of democracy and setting the stage for her fellow committee members to make their message to DOJ even more clear and urgent. \u201cThe Department of Justice has a duty to act on this referral and others we have sent,\u201d Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California said. \u201cWithout enforcement of congressional subpoenas, there is no oversight. And without oversight, no accountability, not for the former President or any other president, past, present or future.\u201d Both Cheney and Thompson linked the referral recommendation to Monday\u2019s ruling by a federal judge that Trump and conservative lawyer John Eastman may have been planning a crime as they sought to disrupt the January 6, 2021, congressional certification of the presidential election. The panel claims it granted Scavino six extensions of his deadline to sit for an interview and hand over documents and noted that several of the issues Navarro said he could not discuss he had previously written about in his book. The first referral from the House, for former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, was picked up by DOJ and has led to an indictment of Bannon. He faces a criminal trial this summer. The Justice Department is still reviewing the contempt referral of Meadows, which the full House voted on in December. Scavino was initially subpoenaed at the same time as Bannon and Meadows. A third contempt referral, for former DOJ staffer Jeffrey Clark, was voted out of committee but did not make it to the House floor after Clark agreed to meet with the committee. Clark sat for an interview but pleaded the 5th Amendment more than 100 times. Scavino used a series of delay tactics to prevent any type of substantive cooperation with its investigation, according to the committee, which argues he never substantively engaged and therefore was in violation of his subpoena. Scavino is one of Trump\u2019s closest and most loyal allies, having served in the administration from beginning to end and as one of his earliest campaign staffers. He was intimately involved with Trump\u2019s social media channels, often posting message to Trump\u2019s followers on the then-President\u2019s behalf. The committee believes Scavino is privy to meetings and details of the events leading up to and on January 6, including strategy sessions that were directly tied to Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results. \u201cMr. Scavino reportedly attended several meetings with the President in which challenges to the election were discussed,\u201d the committee wrote in its report. \u201cMr. Scavino also tracked social media on behalf of President (Donald) Trump, and he did so at a time when sites reportedly frequented by Mr. Scavino suggested the possibility of violence on January 6th.\u201d The committee cites news stories that discuss Scavino tracking the website \u201cTheDonald.win,\u201d which their report describes as a \u201can online forum frequented by individuals who openly advocated and planned violence in the weeks leading up to January 6th.\u201d Scavino has still contested his need to testify, according to a letter from his attorney Stanley Brand to the White House on March 25, which Brand provided to CNN on Sunday. The letter kicks legal questions back to the Biden administration, which had determined it would not protect any of Scavino\u2019s testimony. Scavino, however, argues the law isn\u2019t settled yet on whether the current president can waive privilege on all testimony, including Scavino\u2019s conversations with Trump, especially if Trump may make a claim to secrecy of his own. The committee accuses Navarro, a former White House trade adviser, of making no effort to comply with its subpoena request, claiming that Navarro made it clear that he was unable to cooperate because Trump had asserted executive privilege in the matter. Thompson cited the executive privilege argument in his opening statement Monday. \u201cThey potentially played a part in an attack on American democracy, but they can ignore our investigation because they worked for the government at the time. That\u2019s their argument,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThey\u2019re not fooling anybody. They are obligated to comply with our investigation. They have refused to do so. And that\u2019s a crime.\u201d The committee responded by informing him that there were several topic areas it wanted to discuss with him that were not covered under privilege, but Navarro rejected the offer. Navarro also asked the committee if the proceedings would be held in public. He ultimately closed off communication with the committee and referred all questions regarding his cooperation to Trump and his attorneys. The committee made note of Navarro citing privilege despite the fact that many of the topics it wanted to discuss with him he had already written about in great detail in his book. \u201dThere are topics that the Select Committee believes it can discuss with [him] without raising any executive privilege concerns at all, including, but not limited to, questions related to [his] public three-part report about purported fraud in the November 2020 election and the plan [he] described in [his] book,\u201d the committee wrote in an email to Navarro on March 1. \u201cIn the days leading up to January 6, 2021, according to evidence obtained by the Select Committee, Mr. Navarro also encouraged Mark Meadows (and possibly others) to call Roger Stone to discuss January 6th,\u201d the committee wrote. Navarro has been very public about his attempts to work with the Trump campaign to subvert the 2020 election. In his book, he details a plan called the \u201cGreen Bay Sweep,\u201d which involved convincing state leaders in several swing states to call into question the election results in an attempt to delay and eventually prevent the certification. In a statement to CNN, Navarro responded to the committee\u2019s contempt report filing by saying he believes President Joe Biden does not have the ability to waive Trump\u2019s executive privilege in his case. He also claimed that the committee\u2019s investigation is predicated on a false notion that the 2020 presidential election was \u201cfree and fair.\u201d \u201cMy position remains this is not my Executive Privilege to waive and the Committee should negotiate this matter with President Trump,\u201d Navarro said in a statement. \u201cIf he waives the privilege, I will be happy to comply; but I see no effort by the Committee to clarify this matter with President Trump, which is bad faith and bad law.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Monday.",

The Biden administration is not asserting executive privileges that could shield Scavino from being forced to answer questions about discussions in the Trump White House around January 6, 2021, or about attempts to use the Justice Department to prop up election fraud disinformation. CNN has obtained the letter the White House sent to Scavino\u2019s attorney on March 15 telling him it would not assert privilege related to his House January 6 select committee subpoenas. In essence, this removes the legal shield Scavino had from being forced to testify. The Biden White House says it\u2019s not even interested in sitting in on a Scavino deposition with the House \u2013 a fairly standard approach when former officials testify that allows the administration to step in if they don\u2019t believe certain questions should be answered for secrecy reasons. This position from Biden\u2019s White House isn\u2019t new with regards to Trump-era witnesses and documents. The White House has refused to assert a need for secrecy in response to most House requests related to January 6. Scavino responded over the weekend, challenging whether the Biden administration has the legal authority to make executive privilege decisions related to an earlier administration as the House looks to hold him in contempt. The committee is planning to vote on recommending a criminal contempt referral Monday night.",

            "article_content": "The House Select Committee investigating the January 6 riot has in its possession more than two dozen text messages, 29 in total, between former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Virginia \u201cGinni\u201d Thomas, a conservative activist and the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, according to multiple sources familiar with the messages. These text messages, according to sources, took place between early November 2020 and mid-January 2021. Thomas recently revealed that she attended the pro-Trump rally that preceded the US Capitol attack on January 6, 2021, but says she \u201cplayed no role\u201d in planning the events of that day. The text messages, reviewed by CNN, show Thomas pleading with Meadows to continue the fight to overturn the election results. \u201cHelp This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! \u2026 You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America\u2019s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History,\u201d Thomas wrote on November 10, 2020. CNN first reported that the text messages were in the committee\u2019s possession. The Washington Post first described their content. Thomas regularly checked in with Meadows to encourage him to push claims of voter fraud and work to prevent the election from being certified. Meadows often responded. On that same day as the previous text, he wrote: \u201cI will stand firm. We will fight until there is no fight left. Our country is too precious to give up on. Thanks for all you do.\u201d On November 24, 2020, Meadows promised he wasn\u2019t done battling on then-President Donald Trump\u2019s behalf and evoked his faith as a source of strength. \u201cThis is a fight of good versus evil. Evil always looks like the victor until the King of Kings triumphs. Do not grow weary in well doing. The fight continues. I have staked my career on it. Well at least my time in DC on it.\u201d Thomas wrote to Meadows on November 19, 2020, \u201cSounds like Sidney and her team are getting inundated with evidence of fraud. Make a plan. Release the Kraken and save us from the left taking America down.\u201d Attorney Sidney Powell, who worked on Trump-aligned lawsuits seeking to challenge the results of the 2020 election, was also referred to by herself as \u201cThe Kraken\u201d in reference to the ancient mythological sea creature. By the end of November, Thomas was getting increasingly frustrated with the lack of progress of the attempt to find a path to overturn the results. On November 24, 2020 she wrote: \u201cI can\u2019t see Americans swallowing the obvious fraud. Just going with one more thing with no frickin consequences\u2026 the whole coup and now this\u2026 we just cave to people wanting Biden to be anointed? Many of us can\u2019t continue the GOP charade.\u201d The committee is in possession of only one text from the month of January 2021, four days after the riot on Capitol Hill. Thomas wrote to Meadows that she was angry with then-Vice President Mike Pence for not taking the steps necessary to block the certification of the election results. \u201cWe are living through what feels like the end of America. Most of us are disgusted with the VP and are in a listening mode to see where to fight with our teams. Those who attacked the Capitol are not representative of our great teams of patriots for DJT!! Amazing times. The end of Liberty,\u201d Thomas wrote. Clarence Thomas and Ginni Thomas declined to answer questions from CNN on Friday. \u201cNo, thank you,\u201d said Clarence Thomas, dressed in a blue button-down shirt and standing inside his garage, when CNN asked to speak with him. Ginni Thomas walked away without commenting. Ginni Thomas\u2019 messages reflected a belief that the legal challenges presented by a group of conservative lawyers helping the campaign were valid. She attempted to convince Meadows to put his faith in the hands of Powell, who had spent the weeks following the election claiming to have mountains of evidence of fraud that never materialized. The content of the text messages may be of interest to the committee\u2019s investigation, because it asked Meadows in a subpoena to turn over \u201cboth documents and your deposition testimony regarding these and other matters that are within the scope of the committee\u2019s activity.\u201d The revelation of text messages between Thomas and Meadows, both key allies of Trump, comes as progressives and some legal ethics experts see her activism as a potential conflict of interest for Thomas\u2019 work on some Supreme Court cases. Meadows turned over thousands of text messages before he stopped cooperating with the committee. The texts have proven to hold a treasure trove of information about what was going on in the White House in the days leading up to the insurrection, and what people in Trump\u2019s orbit were thinking. The text messages in the committee\u2019s possession are only part of the tranche of documents that Meadows provided to the committee during the short period of time he was cooperating with their investigation. They do not necessarily represent the sum total of communication between Thomas and Meadows during that period of time. There is also the possibility some messages were not turned over due to privilege claims. Meadows and Thomas are longtime friends, both of whom have been active in conservative causes for decades. While Thomas has been actively involved in politics, she says she has been careful to distance her activity from her husband. \u201cBut we have our own separate careers, and our own ideas and opinions too. Clarence doesn\u2019t discuss his work with me, and I don\u2019t involve him in my work,\u201d she recently told the Free Beacon. The work of the January 6 select committee has already come before the Supreme Court. In January, the court did not stand in the way of the release of thousands of documents from the Trump White House despite the former President suing to keep them secret under executive privilege. The vote on the matter was 8-1, with only Thomas dissenting. CNN reached out to Meadows\u2019 attorney for comment. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment.

            "article_content": "New revelations of efforts by conservative activist Ginni Thomas, the wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, to reverse the 2020 election results cast harsh light on the justices\u2019 opaque process for dealing with conflicts of interest and their lack of a formal code of conduct. Chief Justice John Roberts has adopted a posture of \u201ctrust us\u201d through the years, although other justices have suggested an internal debate has occurred over whether the court should be covered by a formal code of ethics. Three years ago this month, Justice Elena Kagan told a House committee that Roberts was considering whether to adopt a conduct code applicable to the justices. Texts between Ginni Thomas and Mark Meadows catapult Jan. 6 committee back into the news \u201cIt\u2019s something that is being thought very seriously about,\u201d Kagan said at the time. But nothing apparently came of that and since then, controversies undermining public confidence in the justices\u2019 activities have only mounted. The latest related to Ginni Thomas arise as a new conservative 6-3 majority, solidified by the addition of three appointees of former President Donald Trump, is rolling back constitutional protections, most notably on abortion and voting rights. Justice Thomas, on the bench since 1991, is now helping steer the transformed court. Vividly on display this week was also the politically charged Supreme Court confirmation process, as President Joe Biden\u2019s choice of federal appellate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson endured partisan distortions of her judicial record and off-bench activities. If confirmed, she would be the nation\u2019s first Black female justice in the 233-year history of the court. Developments on Thursday has renewed calls for clearer rules and greater transparency concerning when justices should disqualify from cases. It is now known that the House select committee investigating the January 6 deadly rampage at the Capitol has gathered text messages between Ginni Thomas and then-Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows showing Ginni Thomas pleading with him to fight to overturn the election results. She offered thoughts regarding legal strategy, including the use of attorney Sidney Powell, and in one November 10, 2020, text wrote, \u201cHelp This Great President stand firm, Mark!!! \u2026 You are the leader, with him, who is standing for America\u2019s constitutional governance at the precipice. The majority knows Biden and the Left is attempting the greatest Heist of our History.\u201d First on CNN: January 6 committee has text messages between Ginni Thomas and Mark Meadows Justice Thomas participated in Supreme Court cases related to 2020 election controversies, and in one February 2021 opinion, dissented as the full court declined to take up a challenge to Pennsylvania mail-in voting procedures. He demonstrated support for the claim that election fraud is a threat to America. \u201cWe are fortunate that many of the cases we have seen alleged only improper rule changes, not fraud. But that observation provides only small comfort,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAn election free from strong evidence of systemic fraud is not alone sufficient for election confidence.\u201d No other justice joined his opinion. This past January, Justice Thomas dissented alone as the court allowed the National Archives to release to the January 6 committee thousands of documents from the Trump White House, over the former President\u2019s attempt to assert executive privilege. A source connected to the January 6 committee told CNN the newly revealed text messages between Ginni Thomas and Meadows were part of a trove of documents Meadows voluntarily gave the committee when he was briefly cooperating with its investigation. The documents involved in the National Archives dispute that went to the Supreme Court were part of a separate tranche. After initially endorsing Ted Cruz as a candidate early in the 2016 cycle, Ginni Thomas became a Trump loyalist. But the disclosure of the text messages reveals a closer connection to Trump\u2019s attempts to overthrow the 2020 election results through legal efforts that could have culminated at the Supreme Court. The Code of Conduct for United States Judges provides ethical guidance for lower court judges but specifically does not cover justices. Roberts has said the nine consult that aspirational code in their own behavior. Separately and more relevant to the Thomas controversy, a portion of federal law requires justices and judges to disqualify themselves in any proceeding in which their \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d That rule, under which all judges and justices fall, also requires disqualification if a spouse \u201chas a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d Key takeaways from the four days of confirmation hearings for Ketanji Brown Jackson As a general matter, the nine justices decline to explain themselves in the rare instances that they sit out a case. The most common recusals come when a justice has had a hand in an earlier stage of a case, such as when Kagan, a former US solicitor general who joined the bench in 2010, sat out disputes on which she had earlier worked as an administration lawyer. During this week\u2019s confirmation hearings, Jackson told senators she would, if confirmed, disqualify herself from a pending dispute over Harvard\u2019s race-based affirmative action practices because she has been a member of Harvard\u2019s Board of Overseers. Roberts has declined to address the broader topic in recent years but in 2011 said he had \u201ccomplete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted.\u201d In a 2011 year-end report addressing ethical standards, Roberts said the court \u201cdoes not sit in judgment of one of its own Members\u2019 decision whether to recuse in the course of deciding a case.\u201d Roberts contended that recusal dilemmas differ for members of the high court, compared with lower court judges. \u201cLower court judges can freely substitute for one another,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cIf an appeals court or district court judge withdraws from a case, there is another federal judge who can serve in that recused judge\u2019s place. But the Supreme Court consists of nine Members who always sit together, and if a Justice withdraws from a case, the Court must sit without its full membership. A Justice accordingly cannot withdraw from a case as a matter of convenience or simply to avoid controversy.\u201d He said judges should not be swayed by public clamor or partisan demands. Under the Constitution, justices can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House and conviction by the Senate (the same process that applies to a president). Conviction of a justice has never occurred, and only one member of the high court has ever resigned under threat of impeachment, Abe Fortas in 1969. Supreme Court officials did not respond Friday to CNN requests for comment regarding justices\u2019 ethics rules or the new reports involving Justice Thomas\u2019 wife. As a general matter, the court says little about these extracurricular activities \u2013 a pattern that has led to more questions about its institutional integrity. \u201cThe court should be concerned with its own legitimacy and if it\u2019s not, Congress may have to step in, at least in terms of enforcement of basic judicial ethics,\u201d Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, said Friday. But Wheeler, who testified last year before the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court, cautioned that any congressional oversight of judicial ethics can present thorny issues related to judicial independence. \u201cCongress has a role in regulating judicial conduct, but it has to balance the demands of accountability with the need for independent judicial decision-making.\u201d Of the latest revelations regarding Ginni Thomas, Wheeler said, \u201cIt\u2019s not misconduct for any judge to have a spouse who is deeply embedded in highly controversial, even outlandish, political activity. But what is Justice Thomas\u2019 responsibility when appeals related the 2020 election or to January 6 rioters find their way to the Supreme Court? At the very least, there\u2019s an appearance problem.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the US Capitol riot will consider whether to recommend that two former advisers to former President Donald Trump be held in contempt for not cooperating with its investigation and to refer them to the Justice Department for possible prosecution. On Monday, the committee will consider bringing criminal contempt referrals for Trump White House deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino and Trump\u2019s onetime trade adviser Peter Navarro. Scavino was part of the first group of individuals the committee subpoenaed in September 2021 and CNN reported that as late as October, the panel had still been unable to serve Scavino with his subpoena. Navarro skipped his scheduled deposition in early March. In a statement provided to CNN at the time, Navarro claimed he did not show up for his deposition because of executive privilege issues. Navarro responded to news of the committee\u2019s contempt proceeding, by saying, it was \u201can unprecedented partisan assault on executive privilege. The committee knows full well that President Trump has invoked executive privilege and it is not my privilege to waive.\u201d \u201cIf President Trump waives the privilege, I would be happy to testify,\u201d Navarro added. \u201cUntil this matter has been settled at the Supreme Court, where it is inevitably headed, the Committee should cease its tactics of harassment and intimidation. I would be happy to cooperate with the committee in expediting a review of this matter by the Supreme Court and look forward to arguing the case.\u201d In its subpoena letter to Scavino, the committee said it \u201chas reason to believe that you have information relevant to understanding important activities that led to and informed the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and relevant to former President Trump\u2019s activities and communications in the period leading up to and on January 6th.\u201d The committee also cited Scavino\u2019s long history of working for Trump as key to providing important insight into how the then-President handled the January 6, 2021, insurrection and efforts to overturn the election. The committee also cited an example of Scavino\u2019s tweets that indicated he had encouraged participants to \u201cbe a part of history\u201d on the day of the riot. January 6 committee probes security failures as GOP counter-investigation looms In its initial February subpoena letter to Navarro, the panel said it wanted to speak to him because of news reports that suggest he had worked with Trump ally and adviser Steve Bannon, among others, to help develop a plan to delay the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The panel also cited lines from Navarro\u2019s new book in the subpoena letter, where he calls the plan to delay and change the outcome of the election \u201cthe Green Bay Sweep\u201d and describes the effort as the \u201clast, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats\u2019 jaws of deceit.\u201d The panel is setting the stage for these possible referrals as the clock is ticking to wrap its investigation by the midterm elections next fall, and bringing such a case can be a lengthy process. If the criminal contempt referrals clear the committee, they will head to the full House for votes. If those votes succeed, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will send the reports to the US attorney for the District of Columbia to decide whether to prosecute. Under law, the US attorney is required to \u201cbring the matter before the grand jury for its action,\u201d but the Justice Department will also make its own determination whether to prosecute. Any individual who is found liable for contempt of Congress is then guilty of a crime that may result in a fine and between one and 12 months imprisonment. But this process, which is rarely invoked, rarely leads to jail time. As severe as a criminal contempt referral sounds, the House\u2019s choice to use the Justice Department may be more of a warning shot than a solution. Holding a person in criminal contempt through a prosecution could take years, and historically criminal contempt cases have been derailed by appeals and acquittals. This would be the committee\u2019s fourth business meeting to begin referral processes against individuals who have not cooperated with their investigation. Bannon is the only one referred to the Justice Department so far who has been indicted by a federal grand jury on two counts of contempt of Congress. His trial date has been set for July 18. Mark Meadows, who was White House chief of staff under Trump, was referred to the Justice Department on December 14, but no action has been taken since then. The committee voted in favor of a criminal contempt referral for former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark on December 1, but stopped short of bringing that vote to the House floor because Clark wanted the opportunity to claim Fifth Amendment protection. He met with the committee for nearly two hours in February. CNN\u2019s Paula Reid contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson has already ruled in epic battles between Congress and former President Donald Trump, rebuffing efforts to shield White House testimony and records. President Joe Biden\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, who begins Senate hearings on Monday, twice sided with US House committees trying to wrest information from Trump and his top aides. She endorsed a robust role for judges to resolve clashes between the legislative and executive branches, putting her at odds with GOP-appointed judges who found such politically charged controversies beyond the realm of judicial power. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t understand,\u201d Jackson said during a 2019 hearing over testimony sought from former White House counsel Don McGahn, \u201cis this notion that the judiciary can\u2019t play its traditional role in deciding what the law is between these other branches. The Constitution itself sets the system in that way.\u201d Jackson is certain to face new conflicts between congressional investigators and Trump, as well as with Biden and his successors. Ongoing cases involving Trump and the powers of government could land before her, including disputes over whether Congress can access Trump\u2019s financial records and whether Trump could be held accountable by private litigants for the January 6 insurrection. Jackson\u2019s cases testing the checks and balances between the branches, among the most important from her nine years on lower courts, offer a window into her judicial method and courtroom style. Overseeing the McGahn case, she showed a take-charge approach, sprinkled with lighthearted moments. She announced at the outset that she did not intend to \u201ctruncate\u201d the hearing, which ended up going four hours. \u201cIt\u2019s not my practice to impose time limits,\u201d said Jackson, then a US district judge. \u201cI find them distracting.\u201d As the hours wore on that October 31, 2019, she expressed regret for keeping the lawyers from getting home for Halloween. When she asked a Department of Justice lawyer to speak slower, she added, \u201cYou\u2019re an excellent advocate, but I\u2019m just trying to latch on.\u201d The lawyer said he appreciated the compliment because his mother was watching. She rejoined, \u201cHe\u2019s very good.\u201d In the end, Jackson\u2019s 120-page opinion in Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn went against the Department of Justice, which had taken up Trump\u2019s effort to prevent the former White House counsel from testifying. The House Judiciary Committee was looking at the time into possible Trump obstruction of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and had subpoenaed McGahn testimony. \u201cSimply stated, the primary takeaway from the past 250 years of recorded American history is that Presidents are not kings,\u201d Jackson wrote in her November 2019 opinion, denying the Trump claim of immunity. \u201cThis means that they do not have subjects, bound by loyalty or blood, whose destiny they are entitled to control.\u201d In a second relevant case, which came before the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit after Jackson\u2019s 2021 appointment to that bench, Jackson joined a decision letting the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot at the US Capitol obtain Trump White House materials from the National Archives. The court described the episode that occurred as Congress was certifying Biden\u2019s victory \u201cthe most significant assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812.\u201d The House January 6 committee is continuing to investigate Trump\u2019s role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election, including as he appeared at a January 6 rally and told his followers to march toward the Capitol and \u201cfight\u201d for their country. Jackson was an active questioner during the November 2021 oral arguments leading up to the ruling in Trump v. Thompson. She emphasized that a congressional interest in preserving records and restoring public confidence could outweigh a \u201climited intrusion into executive confidentiality.\u201d Jackson spent eight years on the US district court in Washington and the past year on the US appellate court for the District of Columbia Circuit, often referred to as the DC Circuit. Murkowski on tough Supreme Court choice: 'This is a different game' When she was up for that DC Circuit position, GOP senators questioned her actions in the 2019 McGahn case and are likely to repeat that focus in the upcoming hearings. At the time, the House Judiciary Committee was considering a Trump impeachment and sought McGahn\u2019s testimony related to possible Trump obstruction of the Mueller probe. Jackson expressed sympathy with the House position during oral arguments, saying, \u201cHow can the legislature actually exercise oversight with respect to the executive unless it has some ability to enforce its inquiries, its commandments with respect to \u2026 information.\u201d She chastised the Trump administration lawyer for appearing to seek a superior role for the executive branch. \u201cWhat you\u2019ve just suggested is that the President of the United States, not the judiciary, gets to decide when privileges are appropriate, when people can testify or not, and that doesn\u2019t seem to me to be sort of in the purview of the executive under our constitutional scheme.\u201d When Jackson ruled a month later, she referred to the Trump assertion that a president could unilaterally determine whether aides should defy a subpoena. \u201cFor a similar vantagepoint,\u201d she wrote in a footnote, \u201csee the circumstances described by George Orwell in the acclaimed book Animal Farm \u2026 \u2018All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.\u2019\u201d Susan Collins signals Biden Supreme Court pick could win her vote after 'productive' meeting Jackson\u2019s decision issued in November 2019 represented the first major check on the former President\u2019s efforts to elude congressional demands for testimony or other information. Her ruling relied heavily on precedent requiring testimony from White House officials during George W. Bush\u2019s presidential tenure. She was reversed three months later, however, when a DC Circuit panel declared judges lack the authority to intervene in the McGahn dispute and said Jackson \u201cgave short shrift to the separation-of-powers principles at stake.\u201d \u201cIn this case, the dangers of judicial involvement are particularly stark,\u201d then-US appellate Judge Thomas Griffith wrote. \u201cFew cases could so concretely present a direct clash between the political branches.\u201d The full DC Circuit, however, then reheard the case and reinstated the Jackson position that the House case against McGahn was subject to judicial review. Litigation continued, and the two sides eventually reached an agreement in 2021 and McGahn testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Griffith, who stepped down from the DC Circuit in 2020, recently sent a letter of endorsement to the Senate Judiciary Committee referring to the controversy: \u201cJudge Jackson and I occasionally differed on the best outcome of a given case. And in one important case involving the former President, I was one of the two judges on a three-judge panel who voted to overturn her decision. However, I have always respected her careful approach, extraordinary judicial understanding, and collegial manner, three indispensable traits for success as a Justice on the Supreme Court.\u201d Griffith also referred to Jackson\u2019s \u201chistorical and exceptional nomination.\u201d If confirmed, Jackson would be the first Black woman ever to sit on the high court. Senate Republicans who focused on the case during her 2021 hearings are likely to bring it up again. Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa challenged her declaration that \u201cpresidents are not kings,\u201d suggesting she was engaged in a kind of hyperbole. \u201cDid the Department of Justice claim monarchical powers for the President in that case?\u201d Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in one of his written questions to the judge last year. Republicans weigh approach for Ketanji Brown Jackson nomination fight Jackson sidestepped the query and pointed to the administration\u2019s argument: \u201cIn McGahn, the Department of Justice claimed that the President has the power to prevent certain former staff members from appearing for questioning in response to a valid legislative subpoena, even against (the) will of the former staff member to whom the subpoena is directed\u2014i.e., even when the former staff member would otherwise be required by law to respond to the subpoena, would willingly do so, and would be able to invoke executive privilege in the context of such questioning, where appropriate.\u201d Picking up on another rhetorical flourish from the Jackson opinion, Grassley then asked, \u201cDid the Department of Justice claim blood loyalty on the part of Don McGahn?\u201d Jackson referred Grassley to her earlier answer characterizing the administration\u2019s position. The second major Trump case Jackson handled arose more recently, in the context of the ongoing House investigation of the January 6 siege of the Capitol. The former President tried to assert executive privilege to block the National Archives from turning over the White House documents to the committee. New Senate questionnaire details Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's White House contacts during nomination process Biden had refused to assert executive privilege, contending the records were crucial to the January 6 investigation. As in the McGahn case, Jackson during those oral arguments showed regard for the House investigative mission, drilling down on whether a former president would ever be able to eclipse the judgment of a sitting president. Joining her for the panel arguments were US Appellate Court Judges Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins, and the session went more than three hours. In their decision, written by Millett, the trio unanimously rejected Trump\u2019s effort to shield the materials, finding that Trump had failed to provide grounds to override Biden\u2019s judgment and the agreement between the White House and congressional investigators over the documents. \u201cUnder any of the tests advocated by former President Trump, the profound interests in disclosure advanced by President Biden and the January 6th Committee far exceed his generalized concerns for Executive Branch confidentiality.\u201d When Trump appealed to the Supreme Court in January, the justices by an 8-1 vote declined to take up Trump\u2019s case. Only Clarence Thomas dissented, offering no explanation.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge ordered the Justice Department to turn over certain internal documents that may relate to its decision to prosecute Steve Bannon, the former adviser to Donald Trump who has been charged with contempt of Congress after his failure to comply with a House committee subpoena. While it\u2019s not clear whether the documents covered by the order exist or what role they could play in Bannon\u2019s case, he is one of several witnesses sought by the committee investigating the January 6  insurrection who have raised arguments about executive privilege and whether it relieves them from their obligation to cooperate in the probe. Depending on what DOJ ultimately produced under the new order \u2013 issued Wednesday by US District Judge Carl Nichols \u2013 it could offer insight into how the Justice Department views cases like Bannon\u2019s and how it sees his case as different from other scenarios where current or former government officials have not complied with congressional subpoenas. Specifically, Nichols ordered that the department produce to Bannon statements or writings reflecting official Justice Department policy \u2013 public or not public \u2013 if such writings relate to prosecuting or not prosecuting a government official or former government official who raised executive privilege claims as a defense of immunity, or similar issues. Lawmakers have referred another recalcitrant witness, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, for prosecution \u2013 though he has not been charged \u2013 and lawmakers have signaled others may face legal jeopardy if they do not comply with congressional subpoenas related to January 6. Trump has repeatedly tried to shield from the House information from his time in the White House, but when tested in court so far, he has been unsuccessful. Nichols rejected Wednesday several other requests Bannon made for more discovery, and the judge took only intermediary steps in how he was addressing an issue the Bannon team has raised about the Justice Department\u2019s efforts to obtain the phone and email records of one of Bannon\u2019s attorneys. Nichols\u2019 partial grant for Bannon\u2019s request for internal DOJ records came after he asked several questions at the hearing about an opinion that had been issued by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel \u2013 which gives legal advice to the executive branch \u2013 that said close advisers to the president are immune from congressional subpoenas for testimony where the president has asserted executive privilege. Nichols said that OLC opinions, or a position of an entire division or litigative group, are the kind of writings covered by the production order he issued Wednesday. In explaining why Bannon did not believe he was obligated to comply with the subpoena, Bannon\u2019s legal team has pointed to Trump\u2019s indications that he would seek to shield certain evidence the House committee was seeking on executive privilege claims. Members of the January 6 panel noted that Bannon was not a White House adviser during the period they were investigating. Bannon\u2019s case, brought after he failed to comply with a subpoena from the House select committee, offers an important test of the powers of government as Congress tries to force consequences for witnesses who do not comply with subpoenas. The case could also shed light on how broad Trump\u2019s powers could be in protecting the loyalists who defended his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In the run-up to Bannon\u2019s scheduled trial in July, both sides have battled over what they can put before a jury. Nichols, who was appointed to the bench by Trump, has notable experience as former DOJ attorney who worked on an executive privilege case involving a congressional subpoena of the White House counsel to then-President George W. Bush. The judge on Wednesday suggested to DOJ attorney Amanda Vaughn that it would be \u201cinconsistent\u201d for the department to take the position in an OLC opinion that a presidential adviser was immune from a congressional subpoena, but then argue the OLC opinion was irrelevant to a criminal contempt case then brought against the adviser. He offered as a hypothetical a scenario where the DOJ would prosecute Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff to President Joe Biden, for not complying with a congressional subpoena that, according to the OLC opinion, he was immune to. The judge later acknowledged the published OLC opinion in question did not exactly cover Bannon\u2019s situation. The former Trump adviser was charged in November with contempt of Congress for his refusal to appear for a deposition and to produce documents that had been sought by the committee in its investigation into the effort to disrupt Congress\u2019 certification of Biden\u2019s win. Bannon is pleading not guilty and has vowed to make his case \u201cthe misdemeanor from hell\u201d for the Biden administration. He and his lawyers have questioned the motive for his prosecution, pressed prosecutors for more intel on their internal deliberations about charging him and argued that more evidence in his case should be publicly available. Several of the Bannon team\u2019s attempts to obtain more internal information about the House and Justice Department\u2019s handling of his case were rejected by Nichols on Wednesday. But the judge kept alive some of Bannon\u2019s efforts to learn more about how the government obtained communications involving Robert Costello, a Bannon attorney who represented him in his interactions with the House committee. The Bannon team has also taken issue with how the DOJ used a presentation Costello gave the Justice Department, before the indictment was issued, urging the department not to bring the case. Nichols said Wednesday that he will privately review some of the documents that the Justice Department used to obtain certain email and phone records of Costello\u2019s. The Justice Department agreed to let Bannon see certain documents it used to obtain information about an email account that turned out to be associated with the wrong Robert Costello. Bannon\u2019s attorneys were insistent at Wednesday\u2019s hearing that DOJ acted inappropriately in its pursuit of the records and committed a \u201cterrible abuse\u201d of the grand jury process in how it went about obtaining Costello\u2019s records. Costello recalled Bannon being \u201cirritated\u201d when he learned  that the DOJ was treating the presentation Costello gave to the US Attorney\u2019s office as if it was a Costello interview with the FBI. \u201cThe behavior of the FBI and, quite frankly, the DOJ has been outrageous, quite frankly to my attorney \u2026 and the attorney-client privilege and everything they did and that\u2019s going to be worked out in court,\u201d Bannon, who was present at Wednesday\u2019s hearing, told reporters outside the courthouse after it concluded. But Bannon\u2019s lawyers were vague in describing what they hoped to achieve if the government was required to hand over the documents Bannon was seeking, telling the judge that he needed to send a \u201cmessage\u201d about how DOJ behaved. Bannon attorney David Schoen argued that if the judge did not address the DOJ\u2019s conduct, it would become accepted practice. \u201cI think that message has to be sent,\u201d Schoen said. Vaughn, the DOJ\u2019s attorney, defended the department\u2019s efforts to obtain the Costello-related records. She said that, while it was not likely that evidence would be part of the department\u2019s case in chief against Bannon, prosecutors might introduce the evidence if Bannon attorneys sought to dispute at the trial that Bannon was aware he had been subpoenaed. Also before Nichols on Wednesday was the fight Justice Department has mounted to stop Bannon from arguing as part of his defense at trial that he was following the advice of his attorney in not complying with the subpoena. When the January 6 committee was demanding Bannon\u2019s participation in the probe, Costello pointed to claims of executive privilege Trump had said he intended to assert in the investigation. Bannon\u2019s team has also pointed to Costello\u2019s request that Bannon and the House resolve their legal disagreements about his obligations to cooperate with a civil lawsuit. On Wednesday, Nichols came close to giving the Justice Department a significant win in that dispute, but then stopped short of granting the department\u2019s request that Bannon be barred from presenting the my-lawyer-told-me-to-do-it defense at trial. The judge indicated that based on what had been filed in the court papers before the hearing, he was inclined to rule in favor of the Justice Department\u2019s request. He said the two main arguments Bannon had made in the paper briefings were not \u201cpersuasive.\u201d But Schoen introduced at Wednesday\u2019s oral arguments a third, new argument for why Bannon should be able to use that defense, claiming that the appellate court opinion that instructed the judge to take DOJ\u2019s side in the dispute was in fact not applicable in Bannon\u2019s case. Nichols said he was not happy that the Bannon team raised that argument for the first time at the hearing, but he felt unable to decide its merits on the fly. The judge asked both sides to submit a new round of court filings on the arguments in the coming weeks. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

            "article_content": "As Attorney General Merrick Garland completes his first full year in office, what would normally be seen as a banner year of liberal accomplishments has been clouded by the specter of Donald Trump, and the question of whether the former President will be held accountable for attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Despite reinvigorating the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights enforcement and reversing a number of Trump-era legal positions, Democrats are increasingly worried that Garland will let the former President go unpunished for fomenting what amounts to an attempted coup that led to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. In the eyes of many Democrats, Garland has over-corrected in his effort to restore norms at the Justice Department after four years of political wars during Trump\u2019s presidency. That caution, they fear, may in the end mean a lack of accountability for the man who busted those norms. \u201cThere is a difference between protecting DOJ political independence and being too scared to do anything that might be perceived as political even if it is the right and necessary thing to do,\u201d Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal prosecutor said. Pressure to at least examine Trump\u2019s activities is mounting in part due to the work of the House select committee investigating January 6. In a March 2 court filing, the committee accused the former President of engaging in a criminal conspiracy to overturn the election. The committee could make a criminal referral to the DOJ. But many Democrats had hoped the department would act on its own accord. To date, there remains no discernible indication that Garland will formally seek to investigate Trump for his role in inciting the attack. \u201cFrom my perspective as a former prosecutor with the Department of Justice, the department shouldn\u2019t be waiting on our committee for any referral,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the committee, told CNN. \u201cIf the Justice Department believes there is evidence of crime, involving anyone, including the former President, they should be investigating.\u201d The committee\u2019s work has been aided by the Justice Department\u2019s and the Biden White House\u2019s extraordinary decision to share Trump-era documents that normally would be shielded by various executive branch legal privilege claims. Some Justice Department officials had hoped that providing documents to Congress to shed light on the events surrounding January 6 would relieve pressure on the department. But the opposite has happened. \u201cI think that that brief was, in large part, a call to action from Congress to DOJ,\u201d said Honig, referring to the committee\u2019s March 2 court filings, which were submitted in a dispute over the disclosure of a Trump ally\u2019s emails. In a speech ahead of the anniversary of the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Garland broke his relative silence on the matter by seeming to suggest ongoing investigations of attack would spare no one. \u201cThe Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law,\u201d he said, temporarily placating critics on the left. Whether Garland actually meant those words to include Trump is unclear. But so far, none of the telltale signs of an investigation, such as subpoenas or witness interviews, have spilled into public view to indicate that Trump might be a prosecution target. The Justice Department declined a request to interview the attorney general for this story. Separately, Justice Department investigators have continued to examine conduct of lawyers connected to Trump, including Rudy Giuliani, who was a ringleader in efforts to overturn the election results, and Sidney Powell, whose vote fraud claims eventually grew too bizarre even for Trump. To be sure, investigative activity could be ongoing behind the scenes that are not public. \u201cThere are things I\u2019d like to see more aggressiveness on,\u201d said Mary McCord, a former DOJ official who served in top positions during the Obama administration. \u201cBut I spent enough time in the department to understand why these investigations take time and why really getting back to the core fundamental principles of rule of law are more important.\u201d In recent weeks, the department has twisted itself in knots to avoid saying whether the FBI and national security prosecutors are examining the handling of classified documents retrieved in boxes of presidential records that Trump took with him to his Florida estate. The FBI routinely conducts so-called spillage reviews when classified information is found to be handled in ways that are out of the norm. But after the National Archives reached out to the Justice Department to report finding classified information in boxes taken to Mar-a-Lago, Garland has only said the department is dealing with the issue and will \u201clook at the facts and the law and take it from there.\u201d In many ways, Garland has had the kind of year that progressives would normally be applauding. He has stepped up the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights enforcement, overseeing successful prosecutions in two notorious killings of Black men and opening investigations into alleged abuses in police departments. He is suing the states of Georgia and Texas over new voting laws that the department says are discriminatory. And he has imposed a moratorium on federal executions, after his predecessor carried out more than a dozen death sentences. The Justice Department\u2019s civil rights activities have been a centerpiece of Garland\u2019s tenure, in keeping with his promise when he was confirmed by the Senate. He tearfully invoked at his confirmation hearing last year the experience of his grandparents fleeing antisemitic pogroms in Europe in the 1900s, as a cause for his focus on civil rights today. Ahmaud Arbery was gunned down 2 years ago today. Here's what's next after murder and hate crime convictions for his killers He also choked back tears last month when asked about the family of Ahmaud Arbery, who was murdered by White men while going for a run in a south Georgia town. Garland expressed similar emotion recently in a call with the brother and nephew of George Floyd after ex-cops were found guilty of violating Floyd\u2019s civil rights following a trial in Minnesota, according to a person briefed on the matter and Floyd family attorney Benjamin Crump. It was the second time Garland had called the family members, after reaching out following the state trial months earlier. \u201cIt has been proof that the Department of Justice in this administration is taking these matters much more seriously than the previous administration,\u201d Crump told CNN, adding: \u201cBy their actions not just their words.\u201d Not all liberal activists are pleased with the Garland record, however. In recent months, civil rights activists published a full-page advertisement in The Washington Post calling for the department to step up its oversight of alleged police abuses, in this case of the police department in Kansas City, Kan. Garland has announced investigations of alleged abusive policing in Louisville, Minneapolis and Phoenix. But activists have chafed at what they believe has been a slow response to calls for more so-called pattern-and-practice investigations. Garland remains unbowed by the criticism. \u201cThere will be people from the Democratic Party who disagree with my determinations and there will be people from the Republican Party who will disagree with my determinations,\u201d he told a House hearing last October when asked about some of the department\u2019s actions in court. \u201cThat comes with the territory.\u201d After months of internal angst, Garland signed off on seditious conspiracy charges in January against a group of right-wing extremists accused in the sacking of the Capitol on January 6. Some prosecutors had sought to bring the charges eight months earlier, but Garland made them do more work before he thought the case was ready, according to people briefed on the matter. Oath Keeper pleads guilty to seditious conspiracy and will cooperate with Justice Department He also signed off on contempt of Congress charges against Steve Bannon, former Trump adviser, who had thumbed his nose at the January 6 committee\u2019s subpoena. Both decisions came after some doubt over whether Garland would sign off. The House committee has been waiting more than two months for the Justice Department to act on a similar referral seeking contempt charges against Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff. Compared to the Bannon case, the department faces a tougher legal analysis on Meadows because of his role as close adviser to the former President, Justice officials believe. \u201cWith respect to higher-level people, people within former President\u2019s orbit and the former President, there\u2019s going to be a lot of caution exercised before bringing any case, and I can\u2019t say whether a case ever will or will not be brought against any of those folks,\u201d said McCord, who is now the executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection. \u201cYou really want to be darn sure that you\u2019re going to succeed in that, because failure could actually be more harmful to the country than not bringing a case at all.\u201d Garland\u2019s effort to distance himself and the Justice Department from politics can only go so far, given the political nature of many of the matters that are coming his way in his second year and beyond. Prosecutors in the Delaware US Attorney\u2019s Office continue to investigate Hunter Biden, President Joe Biden\u2019s son, a probe that at least initially centered on possible tax violations, but that based on investigators\u2019 questions to witnesses includes a broad examination of the junior Biden\u2019s business activities, according to people briefed on the requests made of witnesses. Hunter Biden has denied wrongdoing and the President has said he expects the Justice Department to act independently. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz is under investigation for possible sex trafficking and the Justice Department faces a looming deadline to bring charges to avoid interfering with Gaetz\u2019s reelection campaign under Justice Department policy. Gaetz, a close ally of Trump, has denied wrongdoing and has accused the Justice Department of carrying out a political vendetta against him. The Gaetz probe began during the Trump administration. Florida radio host cooperates in federal investigation into Rep. Matt Gaetz, attorney tells CNN The Giuliani probe, begun during the Trump era, has been slowed by legal wrangling over evidence seized early in the Biden administration. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are still receiving batches of evidence from a neutral lawyer appointed by a judge, a process set up to protect attorney-client information. Federal prosecutors on Wednesday filed racketeering and bribery charges against Michael Madigan, the Democratic former Illinois state House speaker. And public corruption prosecutors are investigating Texas Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, CNN has previously reported. And then there\u2019s the ongoing investigation by special C=counsel John Durham of the 2016 Trump-Russia investigation. Appointed by former Attorney General William Barr, Durham has now spent more time reviewing the Russia probe than special counsel Robert Mueller spent on his Russia investigation. Durham has brought false statements charges against two people and has used his court filings to portray the FBI\u2019s work investigating the Trump campaign as the product of a dirty political hit job carried out by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. While Durham didn\u2019t deliver a report before the 2020 campaign as Trump had openly urged him to, Durham\u2019s investigation has continued to deliver fodder for the aggrieved former President to claim he was a victim not only in his 2020 loss, but also in the 2016 campaign he won. As much as staying the course of some Trump-era decisions may upset the left, Justice Department leaders must also keep in mind maintaining the long-term credibility of the court, according to Garland\u2019s defenders, particularly when there\u2019s no a clear legal rationale for changing directions. \u201cWhen the Department of Justice just swings wildly from administration to administration \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have any consistency and coherency in the way that it approaches cases, criminal and civil \u2013 I think that just destroys any confidence that the department is actually exercising good judgment and discretion within the rule of law,\u201d McCord said.",

            "article_content": "The House January 6 committee\u2019s aggressive approach to seeking accountability from ex-President Donald Trump, on full display this week, may be setting up a choice for Attorney General Merrick Garland that would trigger a legal and political storm. In a torrent of legal filings, subpoenas, contempt referrals and hundreds of interviews, the panel has constructed a probe that is sweeping in scope and seems certain to bust open the behind-the-scenes maneuvering that led to the worst attack on US democracy in generations. In a new gambit this week, the committee argued to a judge in a case related to the probe that Trump and a conservative lawyer were part of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d to try to reverse the results of the 2020 presidential election. The court filing sparked political intrigue over whether the former President could ultimately end up facing a jury over the insurrection. Then, in a fresh sign of its industriousness, the committee targeted Kimberly Guilfoyle, the fianc\u00e9e of Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., with a subpoena on Thursday. Public hearings designed to expose Trump\u2019s plotting against the Constitution are expected to begin next month. And given what is known about the evidence the committee has already collected, a scathing final report lambasting Trump\u2019s attempt to stay in power in defiance of the people\u2019s will seems assured. Takeaways from the House's January 6 committee's claims of a potential Trump 'criminal conspiracy' Yet the committee is facing fundamental challenges. First, it has no powers to bring criminal charges on its own. Second, it is almost certainly living on borrowed time. Pro-Trump Republicans have vowed to close it down if the GOP wins back the House in November\u2019s elections. And US public opinion is so polarized about Trump that even a shocking report detailing unfettered totalitarianism by the ex-President \u2013 and possible 2024 Republican nominee \u2013 seems unlikely to shift the political needle much. And any attempts to trigger changes to the law to prevent repeats of the insurrection will come up against that ticking political clock, with Senate Republicans able to wield the filibuster to block measures they oppose. But if the panel were to successfully convince the Justice Department that a prosecution of Trump or acolytes was justified, its work could live on and force Trump to face elusive accountability even if a new Republican House majority ends its mandate. Still, on its own, the committee has limited capacity to enforce the accountability that Trump has long skipped past in politics, business and life. Indeed, Trump secured at least temporary relief on a separate front in New York on Thursday. The ex-President\u2019s lawyers reached a deal with the New York attorney general to postpone depositions in the civil suit into the Trump Organization. Trump, Trump Jr., and his daughter Ivanka will now not be deposed until they learn the results of their appeal against a lower court ruling that they must sit for interviews. The deal will likely push off any depositions for at least several months. A more formal move against Trump by the committee \u2013 possibly including a criminal referral to the Justice Department at the end of the investigation \u2013 could be a way of getting around the obstacles in its path. That is why the court filing this week \u2013 in which the panel accused Trump and right-wing lawyer John Eastman, who allegedly masterminded the ex-President\u2019s attempt to steal the election in Congress, of a \u201ccriminal conspiracy\u201d \u2013 is so interesting. The move came as the committee tries to force Eastman to hand over emails he argues are protected by attorney-client privilege. Trump and Eastman have not been charged, and the court filing does not mean they are in immediate legal jeopardy. The conspiracy argument is an attempt to vitiate Eastman\u2019s attorney-client privilege defense. But it is being interpreted by legal observers as a clear signal of the January 6 panel\u2019s ultimate intent and, potentially, as a way to increase pressure on Garland to bring charges. The single most damning email exchange in the new January 6 committee filing \u201cThe Select Committee, I think, is saying here implicitly, they are going to seek a criminal referral,\u201d former federal prosecutor and CNN legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Thursday. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, who sits on the panel, told CNN on Thursday that he didn\u2019t want to get ahead of whether or not it should make a referral. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously not a criminal, prosecutorial body. That\u2019ll be up to the Justice Department,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think there were multiple lines of effort to overturn the election. Some of those lines of effort appear to violate federal law, and we don\u2019t think that any communications in the service of that fraud and that obstruction should be privileged in any way.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s filing was also interesting because it included evidence \u2013 in the form of emails between then-Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s lawyer Greg Jacob and Eastman \u2013 that appear to show that people inside the White House knew the scheme to overturn the election in the Electoral College was wrong. Such evidence could be critical in any criminal case against the ex-President or other officials in his White House. A House referral would deposit a boiling political hot potato in Garland\u2019s lap. The attorney general, at the direction of Biden, has sought to restore the wall between the Justice Department and partisan politics that was torn down by Trump as he sought to use the agency much like a personal law firm. The claims in the new court filing only step up the heat on him. \u201cFrom my perspective as a former prosecutor with the Department of Justice, the department shouldn\u2019t be waiting on our committee for any referral,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIf the Justice Department believes there is evidence of crime, involving anyone, including the former President, they should be investigating.\u201d \u201cThe Justice Department has no requirement to wait for Congress, historically doesn\u2019t wait for Congress, and I don\u2019t think should wait for Congress here,\u201d he added. The California lawmaker had previously raised concerns that the department was not taking the investigation into January 6 seriously, and he said Thursday that concern remains. Garland would have to consider whether a case outlined by the House committee would have a good chance of success in a court of law. Ultimately, the question of whether it is in the national interest to prosecute a former President with future political ambitions would be raised given the far reaching implications of such a case. But if presidents can get away with trying to overturn an election, as publicly available evidence of Trump\u2019s statements and actions suggests is what happened, it would have implications for US democracy in the long term. The Justice Department has already received two criminal contempt referrals from the committee and the full House \u2013 targeting Trump\u2019s former political guru, Steve Bannon, and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, both regarding a refusal to testify to the panel. The department initiated a prosecution against Bannon, who\u2019s facing trial this summer. So far, it has not taken action on the case of Meadows, who, as a serving official at the time of the insurrection, may have better claims that his conversations with Trump are protected by executive privilege. CNN legal analyst Elie Honig suggested on Thursday that the committee\u2019s move was a gambit specifically designed to increase the heat on Garland as the most critical months of the investigation begin to unfold. \u201cThe DOJ has prosecuted over 700 people, but all people who were physically present at the Capitol,\u201d Honig said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom.\u201d \u201cI think what the committee is trying to do here is amp up the pressure on Merrick Garland, (saying) we want you to start looking at the bosses, we want you to start looking at the people who plotted this in advance.\u201d While it\u2019s one thing for the committee to make a conspiracy argument in a case relating to attorney-client privilege, it\u2019s another thing to produce compelling evidence that would stand up in a straight prosecution. And given the stakes, prestige and identify of the potential accused \u2013 a ex-President of the United States \u2013 the burden of proof would seem to be even more elevated. A committee decision to make a criminal referral of the former President to the Justice Department would be certain to trigger an extraordinary political uproar. It would unfold right in the middle of the midterm campaign, ensuring that for a second election in a row, Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud would take center stage. The ex-President would be sure to claim the referral was just the latest attempt by the political establishment to persecute him and his followers \u2013 a charge right-wing propagandists on conservative media would embrace following their efforts to whitewash the history of the Capitol insurrection. Such a referral could also further mobilize Trump supporters to get to the polls in 2022 in pursuit of a GOP-controlled Congress. It could also motivate Democrats alarmed by fresh evidence of the ex-President\u2019s lawlessness as he contemplates another presidential campaign in 2024. And a reminder of the extreme efforts to which the ex-President resorted to cling to power could renew his toxic impact on suburban voters, who were alienated by his radicalism in elections in 2018 and 2020. But a criminal referral against Trump would be one way for the committee to extend an active legacy even if it is wiped out in a Republican landslide in November\u2019s midterms. A final report into that day of infamy, when the Trump-incited mob stormed the Capitol to try to stop Congress ratifying Joe Biden\u2019s victory, that gets big headlines and drops in the last few months of the 2022 campaign could impact public opinion, raise pressure for Congress to enact reforms and be a milestone in history. Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, a member of the panel, teased on Thursday that the information revealed in the filing is only a fraction of what the committee has. \u201cThe information that was shared in that filing is just a tiny piece of information that the committee has been able to gather over the months of work,\u201d she said. Still, it\u2019s just as likely that the fruits of the investigation will fade over time. A potential criminal prosecution, however, could represent a significant return for the two GOP members of the panel, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who have put their political careers on the line to oppose Trump. Cheney is facing a Trump-backed primary challenger and lost her House leadership post for telling the truth about the ex-President\u2019s lies. Kinzinger, who has been ostracized by his colleagues, is not running for reelection in November. This week\u2019s court filing is not the first time that the committee has hinted at a potential criminal referral of Trump. Cheney told CNN in January that his attempt to obstruct the certification of a fair election was certainly a dereliction of duty and that the committee was looking at whether it constitutes a crime.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s onetime trade adviser Peter Navarro did not appear for his scheduled deposition on Wednesday with the House select committee investigating January 6, Navarro tells CNN. The deposition had been scheduled to take place over Webex. In a statement provided to CNN, Navarro claims he did not show up for his deposition because of executive privilege issues. January 6 committee issues subpoenas targeting the attempt to delay certification of election results \u201cMy hands are tied in this matter as the Executive Privilege asserted by President Trump is not my privilege to waive. The Committee has a firm legal obligation to negotiate this matter directly with Trump and his attorneys before attempting to coerce and bully me into cooperating with its highly partisan effort. If the president waives privilege, I will appear,\u201d Navarro said. Navarro claims that President Joe Biden waiving claims of executive privilege in this case is \u201cillegitimate,\u201d which has \u201cexposed the weak underbelly\u201d of the panel\u2019s legal case. Navarro predicts that his case is headed to the Supreme Court by saying, \u201cthat unconstitutional dog won\u2019t hunt at the Supreme Court, where this case is headed \u2013 and I welcome an expedited review.\u201d A spokesperson for the committee did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. On Monday, the White House informed Navarro that Biden will not assert privilege to protect him from cooperating with the select committee, nor will Biden assert immunity to prevent Navarro from testifying. Navarro responded to the White House counsel in an email saying, \u201cMr. Biden is not the president I worked for. Donald Trump is.\u201d In its subpoena letter to Navarro, the panel said it wants to speak to him because of news reports that suggest he worked with Trump ally and adviser Steve Bannon, among others, to help develop a plan to delay the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The panel cited lines from Navarro\u2019s new book where he calls the plan to delay and change the outcome of the election \u201cthe Green Bay Sweep\u201d and describes the effort as the \u201clast, best chance to snatch a stolen election from the Democrats\u2019 jaws of deceit.\u201d Navarro maintains in the book that he was among the \u201clast three people on God\u2019s green earth who wanted to see violence erupt\u201d on January 6 \u2013 counting himself among the likes of Trump and Bannon. Bannon has been indicted on criminal contempt of Congress charges after refusing to cooperate with the committee. He has pleaded not guilty. Pro-Trump lawyer who boosted election-reversal bid under investigation by the California Bar Navarro appeared on Bannon\u2019s podcast this week to criticize former Vice President Mike Pence for saying Trump had been wrong to claim Pence had the authority to overturn the 2020 election. During that appearance, Navarro blasted Pence as \u201cnever a pure Trump guy\u201d and \u201cthe prisoner of Marc Short,\u201d a longtime Pence confidant and the former vice president\u2019s chief of staff, who recently appeared before the House committee. \u201cMike, you are dead politically,\u201d said Navarro.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Presidents today guard their privacy and their phone calls. They claim \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d to avoid telling Congress about the advice they get and the promises they make behind closed doors. Gone are the days of Oval Office recordings like the ones that forced President Richard Nixon to resign. When recordings of these powerful people emerge, it can be shocking \u2013 such as with the recordings of President Donald Trump pressuring officials in Georgia to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn the 2020 election results. Another example is when President Barack Obama was caught on an open mic telling then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he\u2019d have more space to negotiate after the 2012 election. The secrecy today\u2019s presidents seek might seem to protect their careers, but it also leaves everyone else to guess at what\u2019s really going through their minds. That\u2019s why it is so fascinating to hear the recorded conversations of previous presidents, like Lyndon B. Johnson. There\u2019s a trove of these recordings, and many are featured in CNN\u2019s upcoming four-part series on Johnson. Watch it: \u201cLBJ: Triumph and Tragedy\u201d reveals dramatic firsthand accounts from the last surviving members of President Johnson\u2019s inner circle and never-before-broadcast archival material. The series premieres over two consecutive nights with back-to-back episodes on Sunday, February 20, at 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET and Monday, February 21, at 9 p.m. and 10 p.m. ET on CNN. A masterful politician \u2013 Nixon called him one of the top three of the 20th century \u2013 Johnson used a public unified by grief over the assassination of John F. Kennedy to pass civil rights legislation and build the Great Society platform. He also helped plunge the country into Vietnam, a war he knew 11 years before it ended was unwinnable and a situation he described as a \u201cmess.\u201d He is described by an aide in the documentary as using the N-word talking to Southern Democrats opposed to civil rights legislation, but then also hatching an elaborate plan to engineer the appointment of the first Black Supreme Court justice, Thurgood Marshall \u2013 in part to, as he said, \u201cdo this job Lincoln started.\u201d Not even people intimately involved in the civil rights effort knew the lengths to which Johnson went or the things he considered doing. The documentary interviews associates of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who describe waiting for hours at the White House just after King won the Nobel Peace Prize and Johnson won the election in 1964, only to be told Johnson would not be able to pass a voting rights bill. They had seen his national security team leaving the Oval Office as they waited, and knew he was turning to focus on escalating the war in Vietnam rather than a new civil rights bill. \u201cMy feeling was that this wasn\u2019t the President Johnson I had seen in action and that I knew,\u201d says Andrew Young in the documentary. He was King\u2019s confidant and later the US Ambassador to the United Nations and then mayor of Atlanta. \u201cThis was a President Johnson that \u2013 they had been beating up on him. He was tired and he was worn. And there was no fire in him. We were asking President Johnson to try to pass a voting rights act.\u201d Making no promises to King and his advisers, Johnson in fact told them he couldn\u2019t help. \u201cJohnson, he says, \u2018Well, look, I\u2019ve done all I \u2013\u2019 you know. \u2018I\u2019ve got my hands full with the Vietnam War,\u2019 blah blah blah blah. He says, \u2018I don\u2019t have the power to do that,\u2019\u201d says Clarence Jones, King\u2019s attorney, in the documentary. But Johnson was actually still hard at work. The documentary\u2019s producers also unearthed a recording from four days before Johnson\u2019s meeting with King in which he considered deputizing postmasters to register 100% of the US population to vote. He urged his attorney general to find a way around states that would oppose it. 'It was a trap for him': Experts weigh in on why Biden hasn't succeeded like LBJ He didn\u2019t say a word to King or his associates. \u201cMy God. I mean it\u2019s unbelievable. If there ever was exhibit A of being a masterful politician, that was it,\u201d Jones says after hearing the recording for the first time. \u201cI wish we had known that. I had not heard that. But that was before we got there,\u201d Young says. The plan never came to be, and it has echoes in the failed effort this year by Democrats to pass a new national voting standard. Why wouldn\u2019t Johnson just bring King in on his idea? \u201cHe is keeping that up his sleeve, because he wants Martin Luther King to put it all out there for this cause,\u201d says the historian Mark Updegrove in the documentary. \u201cHe wants him to think that it\u2019s all on him.\u201d And ultimately, it was the continued activism of the civil rights movement, along with the violent response of Southern states, that cleared the way for the Voting Rights Act, which Johnson signed into law in August 1965.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden has rejected a request by former President Donald Trump to shield White House visitor logs from the committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, including appointments for individuals granted entry to the White House complex that day. In a letter to the National Archives, White House counsel Dana Remus wrote Biden has determined that asserting executive privilege \u201cis not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified, as to these records and portions of records.\u201d The New York Times was first to report on Biden\u2019s decision. National Archives seeks Justice Department investigation of Trump's handling of White House documents The National Archives provided these documents to the current White House for review in late January, and they include \u201cvisitor logs showing appointment information for individuals who were processed to enter the White House complex, including on January 6, 2021.\u201d Remus explained the administration\u2019s decision by noting that, while Trump decided to block the visitor logs from public view on claims about national security, the Biden administration \u201cvoluntarily discloses such visitor logs on a monthly basis,\u201d with some exceptions. \u201cThe Obama administration followed the same practice. The majority of the entries over which the former President has asserted executive privilege would be publicly released under current policy,\u201d Remus wrote. Following on the letter from Remus, the National Archives sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday informing him that they would be disclosing presidential records that the former President had argued were privileged, including White House visitor logs, to the select committee. David Ferriero, the archivist of the United States, wrote in the letter that the documents would be delivered to the select committee on March 3. \u201cTo ensure that Executive Branch interests are adequately protected, the Select Committee has agreed to treat entries associated with appointments designated as national-security sensitive (NSS) or otherwise-highly sensitive (OHS) as confidential and to refrain from sharing or discussing such entries outside the Select Committee without prior consultation,\u201d Ferriero wrote. \u201cMoreover, to ensure that personal privacy information is not inadvertently disclosed, the Select Committee has agreed to accept production of these records with birthdates and social security numbers removed.\u201d It remains unclear how detailed the visitor logs were under the Trump administration or what the documents could reveal to the committee. White House visitor logs are compiled from information submitted by individuals who have made an appointment to visit the White House, but the extent to which they can reveal the inner workings of the building can be limited. Anyone without a permanent pass to enter the complex \u2013 which includes the White House itself but also several adjacent office buildings \u2013 must submit personal details to be cleared in. Usually, an assistant in the office they are visiting handles the process through the White House Worker and Visitor Entry System (dubbed WAVES). In submitting the clearance information, details are included like who the appointment is with, what date and time it is scheduled for, and where on the complex it is to take place, down to the room number. The Secret Service processes the information, and officers check it against the visitor\u2019s ID when they arrive at one of the White House gates. That is where visibility derived from the logs ends. If a visitor is cleared in to meet with one individual, but ends up meeting with other officials, that would not appear in the logs. If the person shows up at a different time, or doesn\u2019t show up at all, the entry would still be included with the original time and date. While the entry may show a visitor scheduled for a meeting in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, it is possible they ended up in the Oval Office \u2013 escorted by someone who works in the building. Similarly, records of who visits the White House residence can be limited. While those visitors would also be required to submit their information through the WAVES system, both the Obama and Biden administrations excluded visitors deemed \u201cpurely personal guests of the First and Second Families (i.e., visits that do not involve any official or political business)\u201d from their voluntary disclosure. Citing the committee\u2019s need for information, Remus writes that Biden is also instructing the National Archives to provide these documents 15 days after its notification to the former President, \u201cunless prohibited by court order. If the 15-day period expires on a weekend or holiday, you should provide the records to the Select Committee on the next business day.\u201d Why the Donald Trump-National Archives story is such a big deal Remus also notes the committee has agreed to treat such entries associated with appointments designated as national-security sensitive (\u201cNSS\u201d) or otherwise-highly sensitive (\u201cOHS\u201d) \u201cas confidential and to refrain from sharing or discussing such entries outside the Select Committee without prior consultation.\u201d Previously, Trump tried to keep secret \u201cappointment information showing visitors to the White House,\u201d according to court records in his executive privilege fight that went to the Supreme Court. The House ultimately won access to those records, which made up fewer than 30 pages. Last month, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the release of presidential records from the Trump White House to the congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack. The select committee has been gathering information from hundreds of witnesses and communications providers as it examines the events leading up to the insurrection when hundreds of rioters converged on the Capitol attempting to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election results. Assessing Trump's risk if he mishandled White House documents The select committee is\u00a0seeking more than 700 pages of disputed documents\u00a0as it explores Trump\u2019s role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. This includes Trump\u2019s appearance at a rally on January 6 in which he directed followers to go to the US Capitol where lawmakers were set to certify the election results and \u201cfight\u201d for their county. The documents the select committee is seeking include activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. These documents could shed light on the events leading up to the insurrection and reveal what was happening inside of the West Wing as Trump supporters overran the US Capitol. The Supreme Court\u2019s order effectively moots Trump\u2019s pending appeal in the case that centered on keeping the documents secret. Lawyers for Trump say the documents are sensitive and privileged records. This story has been updated with additional information.

            "article_content": "Rudy Giuliani has been engaging with the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection through his lawyer about the scope of his subpoena and whether he may be able to comply with some requests. The panel is making clear that it still expects Giuliani, a central figure in former President Donald Trump\u2019s failed bid to overturn the 2020 election, to \u201ccooperate fully\u201d with its subpoena. CNN reported last week that Giuliani was among four witnesses scheduled to appear before the committee on Tuesday who had their depositions rescheduled. A running list of who the January 6 committee has subpoenaed or requested to appear \u201cMr. Giuliani\u2019s appearance was rescheduled at his request. He remains under subpoena and the Select Committee expects him to cooperate fully,\u201d a committee aide said in a statement to CNN. Robert Costello, Giuliani\u2019s attorney, previously told CNN that the committee deferred a subpoena deadline while discussions are ongoing. The committee has rescheduled interviews for other high-profile witnesses who have engaged with investigators, but those talks are predicated on negotiations happening in good faith. Costello has so far declined to say in what areas Giuliani may be willing to cooperate. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that Giuliani may be willing to testify to the committee about claims of election fraud after the 2020 presidential contest, though the former Trump attorney still does not intend to waive executive or attorney-client privilege. More than a dozen items of interest to the committee in Giuliani\u2019s subpoena have to do with election fraud, and Giuliani may be willing to testify under oath about some of those matters as they are not covered by privilege, the source said. But negotiations are still in the early stages, and there is still no agreement for Giuliani to cooperate. And he hasn\u2019t turned over any documents to the committee, the source said. The New York Times reported Saturday that Giuliani\u2019s lawyer is discussing with the committee the possibility of responding to questions and \u201chas signaled to the committee that he plans to take a less confrontational stance toward its requests than some other members of Mr. Trump\u2019s inner circle who are fighting the committee\u2019s subpoenas or have otherwise refused to cooperate.\u201d The Times also reported Giuliani is still negotiating over whether to sit for a formal deposition or give an informal interview. Giuliani\u2019s apparent willingness to engage with the committee comes as a stark shift from his previous stance. Last month, immediately following news he had been issued a subpoena, CNN reported that Giuliani had indicated through his attorney that he didn\u2019t plan to provide information to the committee, citing claims of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger said on Sunday that committee members \u201cfully expect\u201d Giuliani to speak with them, adding, \u201cThe expectation is he is going to cooperate because that\u2019s the law.\u201d \u201cRegardless of when we hear from Rudy or how long that interview is, we\u2019re getting a lot of information, and we\u2019re looking forward to wrapping this up at some point, when that is right, showing it to the American people, but not rushing it, not hurrying this. We want everyone to have the full story,\u201d Kinzinger said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Former White House chief of staff Staff Mark Meadows was referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal contempt charges after refusing to comply with his subpoena in December. Steve Bannon was indicted in November after refusing to obey his subpoena. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Monday.",

            "article_content": "A stunning daily stream of revelations is shedding new light on the depraved effort by Donald Trump, his aides and extremist Republicans to cover up the former President\u2019s constitutional arson and desperate bid to steal power after the 2020 election. It is extraordinary that more than 13 months after the US Capitol insurrection, the depth of Trump\u2019s lawlessness and abuses of power is still coming into view. It will be for the House committee probing the attack to paint the complete picture and to weigh in on whether they think there was a criminal conspiracy and the extent to which Trump knew about it and directed it. But new evidence and reporting already strongly suggests Trump\u2019s team presided over multiple schemes to discredit the election; sought to steal President Joe Biden\u2019s win in the states with rogue lawyers; encouraged fake electors; and sought to block its certification in Congress. Wednesday\u2019s revelations alone underscored the vast scope of the committee\u2019s investigation, the troubling breadth of the subversion effort and what increasingly looks like a Trump world cover-up. Wednesday\u2019s torrent of disclosures only hints at the size of the election-stealing effort operated out of the Trump White House and of the House committee\u2019s investigation of events that culminated in one of the darkest days in US political history. If there is any comfort for those who believe in American democracy, it is that all of the schemes failed \u2013 often due to the courage of local and state officials, many of them Republicans. But it became ever more clear Wednesday that an ex-President and a corps of fellow believers were willing to attempt to defy the will of voters with authoritarian measures. Document shredding, Trump style That reality underscores the grave danger facing future elections in the US. Trump is seeking to insert like-minded activists and candidates in key positions overseeing elections in what looks like an attempt to destroy safeguards that prevented him from stealing the last election. It is also alarming that while US foes like Russia and China are escalating efforts to discredit democracy in the US and worldwide, their goals are shared by Americans working to destroy it from the inside. The latest details about the insurrection emerged despite incessant efforts by Trump and those around him to obstruct the January 6 investigation. The President waged a failed campaign right up to the Supreme Court to stop West Wing documents making it to the House committee. Some of his aides have made spurious claims of executive privilege to frustrate the panel, which said Wednesday it had nevertheless conducted 500 interviews. Republicans in the House had tried to stop the investigation even starting and are sure to close it down if they win the majority in November\u2019s midterm elections. The closer the committee appears to discovering the truth, the more unhinged is the reaction from the Trump camp. Over weekend, in a resolution censuring two Republicans serving on the January 6 panel, the Republican National Committee described the insurrection as \u201clegitimate political discourse.\u201d That was followed on Wednesday by Navarro unleashing an unmoored outburst after he was subpoenaed by the panel to explain alleged efforts to delay the certification of 2020 election results. He accused the committee, which is investigating an unprecedented insurrection designed to overturn a US election, of being \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d A running list of who the January 6 committee has subpoenaed or requested to appear The request by the National Archives to the Justice Department to look into Trump\u2019s handling of White House records escalates controversy over one of the more recent streams of investigation pursued by the committee. A source told CNN that the Archives wants a review of whether Trump violated the Presidential Records Act, which requires all paper and other documents to be turned over the National Archives at the end of an administration, and other possible violations, including the handling of classified information. CNN has reported the former President routinely ripped up documents and took some with him to Mar-a-Lago after leaving office. The National Archives retrieved 15 boxes from the Florida resort just last month. And a person familiar with the matter previously told CNN that Archives general counsel Gary Stern had contacted Trump\u2019s team last fall to ask about records apparently taken there. It was not clear on Wednesday whether the Justice Department would launch an investigation. Even if it did, it seems a long shot that the ex-President could face formal consequences since the Presidential Records Act contains no enforcement mechanism. The request by the Archives, first reported by The Washington Post, follows days of reports about Trump\u2019s habit of ripping up documents. Sources have said that archivists have been forced to try to tape ripped papers back together before turning them over to the House select committee. The question now is whether Trump will face another legal front \u2013 on top of a criminal probe in Georgia into his attempt to steal votes and investigations in New York into his firm\u2019s accounting. All through his personal, business and personal life, Trump has shown an incredible capacity to escape consequences of his actions \u2013 often because his transgressions are so vast and unprecedented they defy any previous expectations of how presidents behave. Trump sets off yet another GOP civil war, risking party's midterm strategy On the question of the torn and missing documents, Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, suggested that Trump may again escape legal jeopardy. \u201cIt is clearly unlawful,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cThe question of whether it is a crime is a little more complicated. If the intent was, for example, to obstruct justice, to hide wrongdoing, and or other unlawful activity, that would be a crime. Otherwise, it is very wrong, unlawful, but there is no enforcement mechanism and no obvious criminal penalty there.\u201d The fact that the President appears to have openly flouted laws on record keeping was the latest example of his contempt for the traditions and laws that have long defined the office he held for four wild and damaging years. Every presidents\u2019 records are kept, providing historians with intimately detailed primary sources that can be used to reconstruct presidencies decades later. But Trump always appeared to view the presidency as a personal entitlement with which he could do what he liked rather than a sacred trust meant to advance and defend the national interest. That he appears to be attempting to regain the presidency in 2024 \u2013 even with all this fresh evidence of his misconduct emerging \u2013 only underscores that the coming years could be even more dangerous to US democratic governance and respect for presidential guardrails than the previous five.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Donald Trump arguably built his winning bid for the presidency in 2016 around two basic themes: America First nativism and the allegation that Hillary Clinton broke the law with her emails. What follows him out of office are questions about whether he will face any consequences for his own mishandling of documents or, more importantly, for his effort to overturn the 2020 election he lost. More on that in a moment. The growing irony of Trump\u2019s \u201clock her up\u201d chants. First, there\u2019s the fact that he taunted Clinton and threatened to \u201clock her up\u201d for deleting emails \u2013 when she served as secretary of state \u2013 that should have been preserved. This could have taught him not to destroy documents. Then there\u2019s the fact that Clinton lost some credibility among voters for appearing to hide her emails on a private server. This could have taught Trump to preserve everything. Neither lesson was learned, according to two very interesting revelations about Trump\u2019s mishandling of documents and possible violation of the law during and after his time as President. Boxes of documents squirreled away at Mar-a-Lago. Fifteen boxes of documents improperly taken from the White House were recovered from Trump\u2019s Florida resort by the National Archives. Ripped-up documents. Trump, as President, routinely ripped up documents with his hands, ignoring the law about presidential records, only to have aides follow behind and tape them back together. Trump has been at odds with the National Archives. It rejected his claim of executive privilege and, after a court battle, turned over documents to the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection. The committee has received taped-together and torn-up documents from the National Archives. What did Trump keep? Among the documents \u2013 which were previously in the White House residence, according to reports by CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr and The Washington Post \u2013 are the letter former President Barack Obama left Trump at the White House in 2017 and letters to Trump from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Trump\u2019s representatives are still searching for additional missing documents, according to the National Archives. The document handover. No, the National Archives does not have a team of information agents. It was a \u201cguy with a truck and work order\u201d picking up the documents, a source told Orr, and the handover followed negotiations between the general counsel for the archives and Trump\u2019s attorneys. It\u2019s not clear, at least not yet, if any documents taken to Mar-a-Lago were technically classified \u2013 although one can imagine his private correspondence with Kim, which Trump used to describe as \u201clove letters,\u201d would fall into that category. Document shredding by hand. His reticence to give all his information to the National Archives is renewing interest in his tendency, throughout his presidency, to rip things up after looking at them. Orr talked to three former White House officials who \u201csaid the former President sorted through file boxes in a rather methodical way \u2013 tearing up newspaper clippings or drafts of tweets that he had rejected and tossing them to the floor, or stacking papers he wished to hang on to in a disorderly stack atop his desk.\u201d Taking things from the National Archives is illegal. It has a curated list of prosecutions related to thefts of its documents. Most involve the sale of stolen items \u2013 from World Series to World War II memorabilia \u2013 on eBay. Thefts often lead to months or years behind bars. But there is also the case of Sandy Berger, the national security adviser under President Bill Clinton, who went to the National Archives multiple times in 2003, folded documents related to the millennium terror plot, put them in his suit pocket and walked out of the building. He said he wanted to prepare himself to assist with the 9/11 commission. Shredding evidence. In an echo of the actions undertaken by Trump, Berger cut up some documents with scissors. Read CNN\u2019s 2005 report. Berger cut a deal with federal prosecutors for a fine and community service. He died in 2015. There\u2019s little chance Trump will be prosecuted for this. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin said Tuesday that he thinks Trump \u201cviolated the law\u201d when, as President, he tore up documents in the White House and elsewhere. But he said \u201cit\u2019s not likely\u201d Trump will be prosecuted for violating the law designed to preserve presidential records. \u201cI think it\u2019s a violation of the law. I don\u2019t know it it\u2019s ever been enforced on the President. I can understand in light of some of the things he said and done, why he wants to destroy the evidence,\u201d the Illinois Democrat told CNN. The Presidential Records Act was passed in the late 1970s, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, and has applied to every president since Ronald Reagan. It makes clear that presidential documents are public property, according to the National Archives. A very big deal. It is already hard enough to separate fact from fantasy when it comes to Trump, who has conjured an alternate reality where the 2020 election was stolen from him. This analysis is from CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza: At every stage of his life, Trump has creatively edited the narrative to make himself look better. His many bankruptcies weren\u2019t failures, they were savvy business moves. His party\u2019s setbacks in the 2018 campaign were, actually, an upsetting of expectations and a victory. His botched handling of the coronavirus pandemic? He deserved more credit than he got. Riiiiight. When you combine that series of Trump traits, you see a) how difficult it will be for the National Archives to ever get a complete picture of the Trump presidency and b) why it is so, so important that it does everything in its power to do so. Fact vs. fiction and \u201clegitimate political discourse.\u201d Trump\u2019s version of history has many adherents. No less than the Republican National Committee censured the two Republicans taking part in the House January 6 committee and referred to the events of that day as \u201clegitimate political discourse.\u201d That term frustrated many Republicans who want the party to move on and focus on bread-and-butter issues before the midterm elections in November. RELATED: McConnell and McCarthy split over RNC censure resolution Calling the insurrection \u201cpolitical discourse\u201d is also just wrong. \u201cThis phrase is an odd way to describe the actions of a mob that chanted \u2018Hang Mike Pence\u2019 as it clashed with police before breaking through the doors and windows of the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election,\u201d writes the Columbia University research scholar Nicole Hemmer for CNN. A state case into election meddling. And that brings us to something Trump couldn\u2019t tear up or hide from view: the recording of him pressuring Georgia election officials to change the 2020 results in their state. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is looking into charges against people who meddled with election officials after the 2020 election. The probe was launched last year, according to CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Devan Cole, following Trump\u2019s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which he pushed the Republican to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn the election results. \u201cThis is a criminal investigation. We\u2019re not here playing a game,\u201d Willis told CNN on Monday. \u201cI plan to use the power of the law. We are all citizens.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Top aides to Vice President Mike Pence did not discuss direct conversations with former President Donald Trump over several hours of questioning in recent interviews with the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, three sources familiar with the probe tell CNN. The aides, Marc Short and Greg Jacob, drew that line on what they\u2019d be willing to discuss because Trump\u2019s legal team had instructed them not to reveal presidential conversations that the former President\u2019s lawyers believe should be covered under executive privilege, the sources said. The committee was aware there would be privilege concerns. The privilege claims rarely came into play during the uncontentious interviews, and the Pence aides only declined to answer a few questions, according to sources. The witnesses did answer questions about conversations they had with the vice president, the sources said. The parameters set in the interviews are the latest indication that Trump still seeks to keep secret his actions in the White House up to and on January 6, 2021 \u2013 and reveal some details about exactly how his legal team is trying to do that. Specifically, Trump\u2019s team is invoking the presidential communications privilege that protects from disclosure communications with the president directly so that there can be candor in executive branch decision-making. As CNN has reported, Pence would prefer his aides act as the former vice president\u2019s \u201cproxy\u201d so he does not have to appear. And deferring to Trump on executive privilege claims sends a message to the former President and his base that Pence and his aides are not crossing him. Representatives for Short, Jacob and the Trump campaign didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment this week. Trump\u2019s legal team is still trying to draw lines around executive privilege despite losing a lawsuit against the House investigation at the Supreme Court. Also this week, the National Archives revealed that Trump is attempting to assert executive privilege over more than 100 documents from the vice president\u2019s office. Former Trump DOJ official Jeffrey Clark met with January 6 committee for nearly two hours The House investigation has already swept in vast amounts of information from witnesses \u2013 and the pair of crucial interviews with Pence aides comes as they seek insight into the pressure campaign on the former vice president to block the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s electoral win on January 6. Pence refused to go along with Trump and some of his advisers\u2019 wishes. The committee has interviewed 475 witnesses, obtained 60,000 documents and followed up on 375 tips to their hotline. The interviews with Short and Jacob could be some of the most illuminating of the House probe. Short, Pence\u2019s former chief of staff, was with Pence in the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and he participated in a White House meeting days before where John Eastman, an outside attorney working with Trump, explained a fringe legal theory for how he believed Pence could block the Electoral College vote in Congress. Jacob, Pence\u2019s general counsel, was part of the team that advised Pence against Eastman\u2019s plan, and received an email from Eastman during the Capitol riot that blamed Pence for the violence. Some committee members have cast Pence and his office as heroes who thwarted a President willing to flout the law for his own personal gain. While Trump continues to criticize Pence, saying again this week that he had the power to overturn the election results, the former vice president stands by his decision to uphold the Constitution and certify the election. But it\u2019s not clear yet whether Pence himself will cooperate with the House investigation. Given Pence\u2019s long-term political interest, including potentially running for president in the future, Trump\u2019s former running mate still must appease a Republican base unhappy that Trump didn\u2019t hold onto his office.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s advisers drafted two versions of an executive order to seize voting machines \u2013 one directing the Department of Defense to do so and another the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 as part of a broader effort to undermine the 2020 election results, multiple sources tell CNN. The idea of using the federal government to access voting machines in states that Trump lost was the brainchild of retired Col. Phil Waldron and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, the sources said. Both Army veterans spread misinformation about the election being stolen from Trump. While advisers publicly floated the idea at the time, revelations that two draft executive orders were actually drawn up for different agencies to carry out the job underscores the extent to which the former President\u2019s allies wanted to weaponize the powers of his lame-duck administration to overturn the election. Any operation for the military or federal agents to seize voting equipment for political purposes would have been unprecedented in US history. Some Trump White House records handed over to January 6 committee had been ripped up CNN has reported the existence of a draft order tasking the Pentagon with seizing voting machines. That document has been handed over by the National Archives to the House select committee, which is investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Multiple sources now tell CNN that a second version of the document, instructing DHS to carry out the same task, also exists. It\u2019s unclear who drafted the executive orders, and neither was issued. But Flynn and Trump\u2019s former attorney Sidney Powell advocated for the idea during a now-infamous Oval Office meeting in mid-December 2020. The meeting devolved into screaming matches as some of the President\u2019s advisers pushed back on various proposals, including invoking martial law and naming Powell special counsel to investigate voter fraud claims, CNN reported at the time. The House select committee is now looking into the effort to draft an executive order and how it began, including the roles of Flynn, Waldron and Powell as well as another Trump attorney, Rudy Giuliani, and Bernie Kerik, who worked alongside Giuliani after the election to find any evidence of voter fraud. Kerik recently testified to the committee about the effort, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. And a log detailing documents that he believes are covered by attorney-client privilege refers to a memo about seizing voting machines. After the Pentagon draft document, as first reported by Politico, came to light, committee member Rep. Zoe Lofgren said in an interview with CNN: \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary document, and we have a lot of questions about it.\u201d Exclusive: Mike Pence's former chief of staff testifies in House January 6 investigation \u201cWe\u2019ve got no evidence at this point that there were steps taken in the Department of Defense to implement that memo but \u2026 it\u2019s a lawless document and really breathtaking in its approach,\u201d the California Democrat added. CNN previously reported that Giuliani had approached Ken Cuccinelli, who was second in command at Homeland Security at the time, about seizing voting machines after the election, and Cuccinelli told him the department didn\u2019t have that authority. Reached earlier this month, Cuccinelli said his discussion with Giuliani \u201cnever developed to the point of talking about an executive order including such action that I recall.\u201d When asked about the executive order involving the military, Giuliani\u2019s attorney, Robert Costello, said his client also shut that idea down when he became aware of it. \u201cAs soon as he heard about this idea, he was vehemently against it, as was White House Counsel Pat Cipollone and then-President Trump,\u201d Costello said. But Giuliani and his team did continue to pursue other avenues for overturning the election based on the same conspiracies about election fraud cited in the draft executive order to justify the seizure of voting machines. Trump also continued to entertain some of the same core elements of those executive orders, including the idea of installing a special counsel to investigate election fraud. Electoral Count Act: How to stop insurrection 2.0 Nearly two weeks after White House aides pushed back on the suggestion of naming Powell to such a role, Trump raised the idea again during another Oval Office meeting, but this time floated Cuccinelli as a possible candidate, according to testimony provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee by former senior Justice Department officials who were present. Meanwhile, Flynn remained adamant that election equipment was going to be seized and personally reached out to at least one senior defense official in mid-December attempting to enlist their help with his cause, according to a source familiar with the outreach. He also promoted the idea during a Newsmax interview on December 17. \u201dHe could immediately on his order seize every single one of these machines around the country on his order. He could also order, within the swing states, if he wanted to, he could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states and basically rerun an election in each of those states. It\u2019s not unprecedented,\u201d Flynn said at the time. Flynn, Powell and Waldron could not be reached for comment Monday.",

            "article_content": "Marc Short, former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, quietly testified before the House select committee investigating January 6 last week in response to a subpoena, sources tell CNN, in the most significant sign to date that Pence\u2019s team is cooperating with the probe. Short, who was with Pence at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and participated in a critical White House meeting on January 4, 2021, is seen as a potentially crucial witness in the committee\u2019s investigation as the panel pieces together the pressure campaign then-President Donald Trump and his allies waged to try to convince Pence not to certify the presidential election. Former aide on whether Pence will speak to Jan. 6 committee Short testified before the select committee in person last Wednesday in a lengthy session, according to a source familiar with the matter. Short had previously supplied a limited number of documents that were subpoenaed by the committee, according to one source, including a memo from Trump aide Johnny McEntee comparing Trump to Thomas Jefferson. It\u2019s also customary that witnesses hand over more documents when they testify, according to another source familiar with the matter. Short\u2019s testimony, obtained after months of discussions between his attorney Emmet Flood and lawyers on the committee \u2013 as well as a subpoena \u2013 comes as the panel still does not know whether Pence himself will testify. Short declined to comment. A spokesman for the committee declined to comment. While the committee has had early, informal discussions with Pence\u2019s legal team and hopes he will cooperate in some way, multiple sources told CNN that Pence would prefer aides like Short act as the former vice president\u2019s \u201cproxy\u201d so Pence himself does not have to appear. The prospect of Pence appearing before the January 6 committee underscores the dilemma facing the former vice president, whose political ambitions are intertwined with his strained relationship with Trump. The former President still blames Pence for not trying to overturn the election results in Congress \u2013 and Pence has faced a backlash from Trump\u2019s base for his role on January 6. RELATED: A running list of who the January 6 committee has subpoenaed or requested to appear Donald Trump just made it much more likely that Congress changes this election law for 2024 As recently as this weekend, Trump was still blaming Pence, including in a written statement where he bluntly admitted had been trying to use Pence to overturn the election result. \u201cHe could have overturned the Election!\u201d Trump said of Pence. Pence is seeking to walk a tightrope between affirming that he did the right thing on January 6 and the fact that he will need the support of Trump\u2019s base, which falsely believes the 2020 election was stolen, to gain traction in a 2024 Republican presidential primary. Pence has been vague about how much he will cooperate with the committee, and his advisers have pushed back in the media after committee members praised Pence as a \u201chero\u201d and \u201cpatriot.\u201d \u201cThis is all a political calculation because he wants to run for president. Somehow he thinks he can straddle and do the right thing but not alienate the base,\u201d one source said. A running list of who the January 6 committee has subpoenaed or requested to appear Pence may respond to Trump\u2019s comment about him having the right to \u201coverturn\u201d the 2020 election later this week when the former vice president speaks before a Federalist Society gathering in Florida, according to a source familiar with Pence\u2019s thinking. \u201cThere was a lot of pressure, but we always knew we were doing the right thing,\u201d said a source close to Pence. While Pence\u2019s aides have spoken to the committee, his allies have signaled that when it comes to executive privilege, there\u2019s an inclination to remain deferential to Trump. According to multiple sources, the focus on privilege is one way to send a message to Trump and his base that Pence and his aides are not crossing the former President. Committee sources, however, say privilege should not become an issue with Pence and his team. \u201cDiscussions up to this point have been about what questions and what answers could be asked and given without running into any potential privilege roadblocks,\u201d said one source familiar with the discussions. In addition, the committee has made a point publicly of saying that executive privilege can be pierced by criminal activity. Richard Cullen, who was Pence\u2019s lawyer before joining the administration of GOP Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, began initial negotiations about how Pence might cooperate with Tim Heaphy, the committee\u2019s chief investigator. Heaphy used to be a partner in Cullen\u2019s firm. With Cullen leaving Pence\u2019s team to join the Virginia governor\u2019s office, it\u2019s unclear who is now representing Pence. Trump says he wanted Pence to overturn the 2020 election and falsely claims it was vice president's 'right' Earlier this month, Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson told NPR he expected the committee would invite Pence to testify by the end of the month, though the Mississippi Democrat later told CNN he hoped Pence would \u201cdo the right thing and come forward and voluntarily,\u201d while noting the committee had not yet formally asked. In addition to Short, the committee has already questioned retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, his former national security adviser who was with Trump at the White House on January 6, as well as retired Judge Michael Luttig, whose tweets on Pence\u2019s role on January 6 were cited by Pence in his letter released the morning of January 6 announcing he would certify the election. Another top Pence aide, Greg Jacob, is a potential witness. The committee is interested in piecing together how Trump pressured Pence when he and his team called on the vice president to throw out presidential electors while Congress certified Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win. The committee cited Kellogg\u2019s testimony in a letter earlier this month seeking testimony from Ivanka Trump, saying Kellogg had testified about how Trump had attempted to coerce Pence to try to overturn the election on a phone call the morning of January 6. 'He must be kidding': Lawmaker reacts after Trump goes after Pence \u201cYou\u2019re not tough enough to make the call,\u201d Kellogg testified that Trump told Pence. Short was with Pence at the Capitol on January 6 when rioters were chanting \u201chang Mike Pence\u201d and Trump tweeted, \u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\u201d Short was also at Pence\u2019s side in the Oval Office for a pivotal January 4 meeting when Trump and attorney John Eastman tried to convince the then-vice president he could overturn the presidential election results in Congress on January 6. Eastman had drafted a memo arguing Pence could throw out states\u2019 results in a scheme to push the election to the House of Representatives, and the meeting is a key part of the select committee\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election result.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge is forcing a conservative lawyer who had worked for then-President Donald Trump before the January 6 insurrection to respond to a House select committee subpoena of Chapman University for his emails \u2013 setting congressional investigators up to receive access to information they\u2019ve wanted for months but had not been able to get. Federal Judge David Carter in Santa Ana, California, on Monday pinned down exactly when law professor John Eastman was at work for his client, Trump, as he devised a plan to overturn the 2020 election result. A lawyer for Eastman told the judge during a court hearing Monday that his client had been working for Trump during a number of major controversial moments leading up to January 6: When he told state legislators on January 2 they needed to \u201cfix this, this egregious conduct\u201d that would put Joe Biden in the White House, when he was in the Willard Hotel with other Trump contacts, and when he met with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence on January 3 about blocking the congressional certification of the 2020 vote. The admissions from Eastman\u2019s lawyer, Charles Burnham, are the clearest statements yet on how much Eastman was doing on Trump\u2019s behalf \u2013 rather than on his own initiative \u2013 in the days leading up to January 6, 2021. \u201cThat work was done pursuant to representation of the president,\u201d Burnham said, when asked specifically about Eastman briefing hundreds of state legislators. The judge then asked Eastman\u2019s team who his client was during each of the moments the House sought information about in their letter to Eastman announcing his subpoena. Eastman had been working for his client, Trump, his lawyer said in court to nearly every question. Eastman previously refused to provide information to the House when it subpoenaed him directly for testimony and documents. He had claimed his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination as a response to nearly 150 questions and to his document subpoena, a lawyer for the House said on Monday. The House committee then went to his former employer, Chapman University, to seek his records. The university received a House subpoena last week, and Eastman sued to block it, pulling the dispute into the California federal court. Carter had announced he would rule against Eastman on Monday night, after the long hearing, but he didn\u2019t explain his full reasoning until issuing his written opinion on Tuesday. Eastman had tried with Carter to undercut the committee by arguing it didn\u2019t have enough Republicans or the Republicans that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy wanted. But the judge decided Tuesday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had followed House regulations in appointing members and \u201cthe Select Committee is property constituted.\u201d The committee, Carter said, was properly composed and within its abilities to subpoena Eastman\u2019s emails from his former employer. The ruling marked the first time a judge has ruled on substantive arguments that witnesses have made attacking the House panel\u2019s composition. \u201cThe public interest here is weighty and urgent,\u201d the judge wrote, endorsing the committee\u2019s work as within the law. \u201cCongress seeks to understand the causes of a grave attack on our nation\u2019s democracy and a near-successful attempt to subvert the will of the voter.\u201d By the end of Monday\u2019s hearing, the judge had set a plan for Eastman to make even more disclosures to the House in the coming days. His former employer, Chapman University, will give Eastman\u2019s legal team access to his nearly 19,000 emails by midday on Tuesday, so they can sort through and identify which emails they believe should stay confidential as legal advice between Eastman and Trump, who was Eastman\u2019s client as he shopped a legal theory to overturn the 2020 election on January 6. A third party \u2013 potentially the judge or a team of reviewers \u2013 will then decide whether the emails can stay secret, as attorney-client privileged records. Carter indicated at the court hearing on Monday that he wanted the email reviews to happen fast, having the parties work over the weekend and telling Eastman to hand over emails to the House as they are sorted through. \u201cThe Court expects that the parties will work together with the urgency that this case requires,\u201d Carter wrote in a short order following the hearing. The House, Eastman\u2019s team and Chapman University will provide updates to the court in the coming days and appear before Carter again in a week. It\u2019s unclear how long the attorney-client privilege review ultimately will take. Carter on Monday had said Eastman would lose his broader challenge of the House\u2019s authority, and on his claims that his constitutional rights of free speech and protection from illegal search were being violated. The judge\u2019s quick resolution is a notable step forward for the House, as more than a dozen January 6-related witnesses challenge the select committee\u2019s authority in court. It also sets up the likelihood that the House will be able to obtain communications that Eastman and Trump shared with others about the election, as well as other documents that may not be protected by attorney-client confidentiality. This story has been updated with additional details from the hearing.",

But it would\u2019ve directed the Secretary of Defense to \u201cseize, collect, retain and analyze all machines, equipment, electronically stored information, and material records\u201d related to Trump\u2019s false claims of an international vote-rigging conspiracy to deprive him of a second term in the White House, according to the draft. It is unclear who wrote the draft order, which is full of legal language asserting presidential powers to seize the election equipment and conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. The draft also said the defense secretary could identify National Guard units to be federalized to help the effort. Any operation for the military or federal agents to seize voting equipment for political purposes would\u2019ve been unprecedented in US history, and tantamount to a coup. House January 6 committee now has all the White House records Trump tried to block The order would have appointed a special counsel to investigate the 2020 election and \u201cinstitute all criminal and civil proceedings as appropriate based on the evidence collected.\u201d The draft appears to be one of the documents that Trump fought to block from the January 6 select committee, which is investigating his attempts to subvert the 2020 election. Addressing the Politico reporting, Rep. Elaine Luria, a Democrat from Virginia and a member of the House committee, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that \u201cit\u2019s incredibly concerning if this is in fact a verifiable document.\u201d \u201cWe got 700 pages today,\u201d Luria said Friday of Trump White House documents provided to the committee by the National Archives. \u201cI know that there\u2019s been some reporting out there from various sources, so we\u2019re still going through those documents, but, having seen the reporting myself, it\u2019s incredibly concerning if this is in fact a verifiable document that was drafted by somebody in the President\u2019s inner circle.\u201d \u201cWe are looking at this very close, still determining if that reporting is accurate, but it is certainly very concerning.\u201d In a court filing last year, the National Archives said that Trump had asserted executive privilege over \u201ca draft Executive Order on the topic of election integrity\u201d which was four pages long. One source who was interviewed by the January 6 committee told CNN they were asked about the existence of a draft memo that outlined plans to seize voting machines. But the source couldn\u2019t confirm that that the questions were specifically about the draft published by Politico. A spokesperson for the committee declined to comment. CNN has not been able to independently verify the documents. The draft executive order was dated December 16, 2020, according to the document published by Politico. That was two days after the Electoral College met in state capitals to formalize President Joe Biden\u2019s victory, dealing a huge blow to Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the election. Trump's January 6 documents are at the House. When can we see them and what's next? The idea was originally floated at a highly controversial December 2020 White House meeting, which included talk of declaring martial law, appointing a special counsel to hunt for voter fraud and ordering federal agents to seize election equipment, according to previous CNN reporting. These extreme ideas were promoted by former Trump adviser Michael Flynn and his right-wing lawyer, Sidney Powell. CNN also reported that Trump\u2019s then-attorney Rudy Giuliani asked a senior official from the Department of Homeland Security if the department could seize voting equipment in certain states so that they could be examined for evidence of widespread fraud. CNN previously reported that some White House lawyers and top officials, including Trump\u2019s chief of staff Mark Meadows, strongly argued against the Flynn-backed idea to declare a state of emergency so that the federal government could seize voting equipment in key states. The January 6 committee has subpoenaed Giuliani, Flynn and Powell \u2013 three stalwart Trump allies who led a disinformation campaign about the 2020 election and accused voting machine companies of participating in a global conspiracy to switch ballots from Biden to Trump. Many of their debunked theories were mentioned in the draft executive order, according to Politico. In subpoena letters to Giuliani and Powell, the committee cited witness testimony and news reports alleging that they \u201curged President Trump to direct the seizure of voting machines around the country after being told that the Department of Homeland Security had no lawful authority to do so,\u201d CNN reported. They broadly deny wrongdoing related to the 2020 election.",

            "article_content": "Thanks to the Supreme Court, the House select committee investigating January 6 has now received all the pages from the National Archives that former President Donald Trump had tried to block. Supreme Court ruling is a bitter legal and personal blow to Trump The defeat of Trump\u2019s legal challenge was resounding, though the Supreme Court left the door open to other efforts to challenge certain committee fact-finding efforts on the basis of executive privilege. But its rejection of Trump\u2019s arguments is certain to ripple across the considerations other witnesses are making about whether to cooperate with the probe and what chances their potential legal challenges have to success. And by already speaking to more than 400 witnesses and now getting the hundreds of pages top officials\u2019 White House records that were at the heart of the case before the Supreme Court, the committee is likely to be able to fill in key details about what has happening around Trump in the lead-up and during the attack on Congress\u2019 election certification vote. Here\u2019s what comes next: The documents in question were being held by the National Archives, which inherited them when Trump left office. The Archives was processing documents requested by the House on a rolling basis and consulting with both President Joe Biden and Trump about potential assertions of executive privilege. January 6 committee asks Ivanka Trump to talk with them Trump had initially sued to stop the release of three tranches where Biden declined to assert privilege after Trump had said that they should be kept secret. Those documents amounted to more than 700 pages of records detailing the goings on within the White House in the period the House is investigating. The records include activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Other top officials\u2019 records in the batches are from then-press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, then-Deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin, and even lists showing calls to the President and the Vice President. For now, the documents will be out of public view and within the hands of investigators. However, House Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said Thursday that at some point the committee will post the documents publicly, but declined to specify the timeline for doing so. The committee had already previewed its intention to release an interim report with their initial findings by the summer, with a final report set to come this fall. Public hearings, which could potentially include testimony from key witnesses, also may be in the works. There\u2019s an incentive for lawmakers to keep secret for now the content of what they already have, so that witnesses cannot augment their testimony based on what the House already knows. House lawmakers have said they are particularly interested in what was happening within the White House as the Capitol attack unfolded and what Trump knew about the potential it would get violent. Takeaways and new details from the New York AG's investigation into Trump's business empire Committee leaders have said that they\u2019re probing the delay in Trump calling off the rioters and whether that amounted to a dereliction of duty. Furthermore, lawmakers have framed up the attack as the culmination of a months-long effort to overturn the results of the election \u2013 and not just a riot that arose out of a vacuum. The Trump White House documents may shed light on the other efforts made by the former President and his allies to disrupt Biden\u2019s win even before his supporters sought to impede Congress\u2019 certification of the results. Wednesday\u2019s Supreme Court order showed that the justices weren\u2019t going to be willing to rubber stamp any legal challenge to the committee\u2019s work. Furthermore, the Supreme Court endorsed a key finding by the lower courts, that is now law that witnesses can\u2019t challenge in DC: that the House committee \u201cplainly\u201d has reason to seek January 6-related documents from the Trump White House, and that Trump\u2019s reasons aren\u2019t enough to block their requests. On Thursday, Judge James Boasberg of the trial-level DC District Court acknowledged in a court challenge from a Trump spokesman against the House committee that it\u2019s settled law that the January 6 panel has a legitimate \u201clegislative purpose.\u201d Trump did not want to tweet 'stay peaceful' during January 6 riot, key former aide says \u201cHow could I decide differently from what the DC Circuit has decided there?\u201d Boasberg said at a hearing Thursday, noting the Supreme Court \u201ccertainly didn\u2019t vacate\u201d the finding that the House committee has a legislative purpose. Still, more than a dozen witnesses whose records or testimony have been subpoenaed by the House are still challenging the committee\u2019s authority in court. Several of the cases make a claim about the makeup of the committee \u2013 and its lack of members selected by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy \u2013 that some lawyers in Trump-world believe is their best shot for impeding the committee\u2019s work. Notably, the Supreme Court explicitly left open a question presented in Trump\u2019s case about the power of a former president to keep secret some of his presidential records even when the current President sides with transparency, making more court fights from recalcitrant witnesses or Trump himself still possible. But the Supreme Court siding so firmly against Trump on his top officials\u2019 White House records could pen the dam towards more cooperation with the committee. The Supreme Court decision Wednesday rested on the DC Circuit\u2019s finding that Trump would have lost the case, even if he was the sitting president. \u201cUnder any of the tests advocated by former President Trump, the profound interests in disclosure advanced by President Biden and the January 6th Committee far exceed his generalized concerns for Executive Branch confidentiality,\u201d the DC Circuit said, in a part of its opinion the Supreme Court pointed to support the release of the documents. The DC Circuit knocked Trump for failing to make arguments specific to the content of the documents for why they should not be disclosed. So in theory, Trump could try his luck again for future tranches where he could argue why individual documents should fall under an executive privilege that trumps the needs of the committee. Questions about whether Trump advisers may be compelled to testify about their communications with Trump could also be further tested in court. Nevertheless, key to Trump\u2019s strategy was delay, and running down the clock until Republicans retake the House in the midterms, as expected, and end the committee\u2019s investigation. But the courts rejected Trump\u2019s request with remarkable speed \u2013 with the Supreme Court\u2019s order Wednesday coming down just three months after he filed the case. This story has been updated Friday with details of the number of documents being transferred. CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The walls are starting to close in on Donald Trump. Consider what happened just on Wednesday: 1) In a court filing, New York Attorney General Letitia James said that her investigation into the Trump Organization has turned up a number of \u201cmisleading statements and omissions\u201d in tax disclosures and financial statements used to secure loans. As a result of those findings, James said she needs the former president, as well as Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr., to testify about what they knew and when they knew it. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s actual knowledge of \u2014 and intention to make \u2014 the numerous misstatements and omissions made by him or on his behalf are essential components to resolving [the Office of the Attorney General\u2019s] investigation in an appropriate and just manner,\u201d the filing states. \u201cLikewise, Donald Trump, Jr. and Ivanka Trump worked as agents of Mr. Trump, acted on their own behalves, and supervised others in connection with the transactions at issue here; their testimony is necessary for appropriate resolution of OAG\u2019s investigation as well.\u201d 2) The Supreme Court allowed more than 700 documents from the presidential record to be sent to the US House committee investigating the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. As CNN noted: \u201cThe documents include activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 paperwork that could reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the Capitol, disrupting the certification of the 2020 vote.\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team opposed the release, citing executive privilege. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Even one of those developments should be worrisome for Trump. Both happening on the same day? You can bet it wasn\u2019t a quiet night down at Mar-a-Lago. (Amazingly, the former president has yet to comment on either of the developments on Wednesday.) What Wednesday makes clear is that the biggest potential impediment to Trump\u2019s return to the national political stage isn\u2019t political \u2013 it\u2019s legal. And Trump\u2019s Thursday wasn\u2019t much better: In Georgia, the Fulton County district attorney requested a special grand jury as part of an investigation into the former President\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election results in the state. In addition to James\u2019 investigation into the possible over- (and under-) valuing of Trump properties and the January 6 committee, Trump is also dealing with the following: 1) The new Manhattan district attorney told CNN in December that he plans to focus on the high-profile probe into Trump\u2019s business practices and may expand the investigative team. As CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell reported: \u201cThe investigation, which has been underway for several years, appears to be coming to a head with prosecutors focusing on the accuracy of the Trump Organization\u2019s financial statements when seeking financing, people familiar with the matter have told CNN.\u201d 2) E. Jean Carroll is alleging defamation in regards to her allegation that Trump raped her in the 1990s. He denied her rape allegation, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s not my type,\u201d which prompted her lawsuit. The case is still being litigated. In December, a three-judge federal appeals court questioned lawyers for both Carroll and Trump. 3) Mary Trump, the niece of the former President \u2013 and the author of the scathing bestseller \u201cToo Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World\u2019s Most Dangerous Man\u201d \u2013 sued Trump in 2020, alleging that he, his sister and his late brother had committed fraud to keep her from getting her fair share of the estate of Trump\u2019s father, Fred Sr., Earlier this month, a New York state judge heard Trump\u2019s request to dismiss the case. That\u2019s a whole lot of legal exposure for the former president. And while it\u2019s not yet clear whether Trump (or his close family members) will be found culpable in any of these suits, it\u2019s also not a slam dunk that they won\u2019t be. Trump has long adopted a legal strategy of dragging out any and all proceedings for as long as he can \u2013 in hopes that a) people lose interest and b) the other side folds (usually from a lack of money to continue the legal wrangling). That strategy seems unlikely to work this time around, with the US House, the New York attorney general and the Manhattan district attorney on the other side of the table from Trump. And, the two blows struck against Trump on Wednesday suggest that things are likely to get worse for him and his inner circle long before they get better. Trump, ever the survivor, will likely downplay all of this as a witch hunt designed to hurt him politically. While he would be wrong about the witch hunt allegation, he would be absolutely right that these legal problems could well impact his political future. (He did respond to Thursday\u2019s news in Georgia \u2013 complete with a witch hunt line.) UPDATE: This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to block the release of Trump White House documents to the House January 6 committee represents a huge defeat for the ex-President\u2019s frantic effort to cover up his 2021 coup attempt. The major blow on Wednesday \u2013 yet another instance of the courts rebuking Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to use them for his own political gain \u2013 will allow the committee to go even deeper inside his West Wing and understand what was going on before and during his mob\u2019s attack on the US Capitol. It will also likely be viewed by the former President as a betrayal by the court\u2019s conservative majority, which he cemented with three picks for the top bench whom he saw as a legal insurance policy as he\u2019s continually sought to bend governing institutions to avoid accountability. The decision means that 700 documents \u2013 including schedules, speech and call logs, and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 can be transferred from the National Archives to the House committee, a process that was already underway Wednesday evening. Supreme Court clears the way for House to get Trump White House documents Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, welcomed the court decision as a \u201cvictory for the rule of law and American democracy\u201d and vowed to uncover all the facts about the violence of January 6 and its causes. Trump had mounted an intense effort to avoid such scrutiny and had already lost cases in district and appellate courts as part of a broad campaign of obstruction of the committee, which has included expansive executive privilege claims by ex-aides \u2013 even some, like his populist political guru Steve Bannon, who were not serving White House officials at the time of the insurrection. Another committee member, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d that the Supreme Court ruling was a \u201cvery big deal for getting the truth out.\u201d \u201cWe are going to get these documents and we are going to go through them and help piece this picture together,\u201d the California Democrat said. The case came together after President Joe Biden declined to support Trump\u2019s attempt to prevent the handover of the documents, arguing that the attack on the Capitol was such an affront to the Constitution that it must be investigated. The Supreme Court did not rule on the key legal question of what happens when there is a dispute between a current and a former president on the scope of executive privilege \u2013 a concept meant to ensure that advice to a commander in chief from subordinates can stay private. But it allowed to stand a ruling by the appellate court that found Trump had not demonstrated that his concerns for executive branch confidentiality should override \u201cprofound interests in disclosure\u201d cited by Biden. A year after leaving office, Trump looks to 2022 to rebrand his legacy Trump\u2019s lawyers had asked the Supreme Court for a full review of the case, citing important issues of privilege that will reverberate through history. But the committee made a request for an expedited review just before Christmas, citing the urgency of its investigation. The ruling closes off one avenue of Trump\u2019s legal strategy: running out the clock on the investigation before November\u2019s midterm elections and a possible GOP takeover of the House. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling will play into an intense debate over efforts by former Trump aides to assert executive privilege in order to avoid testifying to the committee. Some of those claims are especially unusual and, according to many legal experts, frivolous because they cover conversations between officials and outsiders, rather than with the then-President. Wednesday\u2019s ruling, in which only conservative Justice Clarence Thomas signaled dissent, will also offer a new mark of legitimacy to the select committee, amid claims by pro-Trump Republicans that it is an illegally constituted witch hunt despite being voted into being by the House. It will also boost the committee\u2019s race against time as it tries to complete its work before a possible new Republican majority shuts it down. The net has significantly tightened around the Trump White House in recent weeks. A running list of who the January 6 committee has subpoenaed or requested to appear CNN reported earlier this month that the committee had received firsthand information from multiple sources about what Trump had been doing in the White House during the insurrection. Then-Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s national security adviser Keith Kellogg, who was with Trump on that notorious day, has also testified to the panel, sources told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel. On Tuesday, CNN exclusively reported that the committee had subpoenaed and obtained phone number records from one of the ex-President\u2019s sons, Eric Trump, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to his brother, Donald Trump Jr. The committee is interested in investigating the level of coordination between Trump\u2019s team and organizers of the Washington rally at which the then-President told supporters who later moved to the Capitol to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to stop Congress from certifying Biden\u2019s election win. Committee members also want more information on the extreme legal scheme hatched by some Trump advisers designed to convince Pence to interfere in the process of counting electoral votes from the states. And the panel wants answers on why it took Trump so long to call for his supporters to leave the Capitol. But even if Wednesday\u2019s decision helps the committee paint an even more dire depiction of Trump\u2019s culpability for the riot and his behavior on January 6, it appears unlikely to meaningfully reshape the fraught politics of the insurrection. Swathes of the Republican Party, especially in the House, have done their best to whitewash Trump\u2019s role that day as he contemplates a possible comeback presidential bid in 2024. Millions of Trump supporters are persuaded by his false claims of election fraud and his argument that the real insurrection was in the November 2020 election, rather than on January 6, 2021. There is no doubt, however, that Trump will be apoplectic that his three Supreme Court nominees, Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, did not publicly dissent from denying his bid to keep his West Wing records secret. Trump has repeatedly slammed the Supreme Court for throwing out his false claims of election fraud, claiming he was a victim of a miscarriage of justice even though his delusional cases were also dismissed by multiple lower courts. Even before the election in 2020, the then-President had said it was important to quickly confirm Barrett so that she could be in place to vote on any election disputes. Throughout his presidency, Trump appeared to equate judicial and Cabinet nominations with an act of patronage, viewing those selected as owing him a debt that would be repaid by pursuing his interests rather than honoring the rule of law and the Constitution. He frequently railed at judges who knocked back administration policies, viewing them as politically motivated if they disagreed with his view of a case. The most notorious example of this desire for almost feudal loyalty came when he pressed then-FBI Director James Comey for a pledge of fealty early in his administration, before later firing him over the Russia probe. The Supreme Court ruling was the second legal blow to Trump in as many days. In a late-night court filing on Tuesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said her office had uncovered \u201cmisleading or fraudulent\u201d financial statements from Trump\u2019s business empire. She is seeking to compel testimony from Trump, Trump Jr. and the ex-President\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump as part of her civil investigation into the Trump Organization. The former President has denied wrongdoing, and a spokesperson for the Trump Organization said in a statement that the \u201callegations are baseless and will be vigorously defended.\u201d The gathering clouds around Trump would represent a grave legal and reputational risk to a normal politician, but given his talent for impunity, it\u2019s far from certain that they will slow his political aspirations.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court cleared the way Wednesday for the release of presidential records from the Trump White House to a congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The court\u2019s order means that more than 700 documents will be transferred to Congress that could shed light on the events leading up to the insurrection when hundreds of rioters converged on the Capitol attempting to stop certification of the 2020 presidential election results. Only Justice Clarence Thomas said publicly that he would have granted former President Donald Trump\u2019s request to block the document handover from the National Archives to the House select committee. No other justices made an objection public. The Biden White House supports releasing the records to the committee, after determining the disclosure is in the nation\u2019s best interest and declining to assert executive privilege. \u201cThe Supreme Court\u2019s action tonight is a victory for the rule of law and American democracy,\u201d Reps. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican \u2013 who are chair and vice chair of the panel \u2013 said in a joint statement Wednesday. \u201cThe Select Committee has already begun to receive records that the former President had hoped to keep hidden and we look forward to additional productions regarding this important information.\u201d The select committee is seeking more than 700 pages of disputed documents as it explores Trump\u2019s role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That includes his appearance at a January 6 rally in which he directed followers to go to the US Capitol where lawmakers were set to certify the election results and \u201cfight\u201d for their county. January 6 committee subpoenas Giuliani and 3 others The documents include activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 paperwork that could reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the Capitol, disrupting the certification of the 2020 vote. Trump is also seeking to keep secret a draft proclamation honoring two police officers who died in the siege and memos and other documents about supposed election fraud and efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s loss of the presidency, the National Archives has said in court documents. White House spokesman Mike Gwin said in a statement after the ruling that Trump\u2019s \u201cactions represented a unique and existential threat to our democracy, and President Biden has been clear that these events require a full investigation to ensure that what we saw on January 6th can never happen again. Today\u2019s ruling by the Supreme Court is an important step forward in that process, and in ensuring accountability for an unprecedented assault on our democracy and the rule of law.\u201d The National Archives and lawyers for Trump have not responded to CNN inquiries about the Supreme Court\u2019s order. The move effectively moots former Trump\u2019s pending appeal in the case that centered on keeping the documents secret. Lawyers for Trump say the documents are sensitive and privileged records. \u201cThe disagreement between an incumbent President and his predecessor from a rival political party is both novel and highlights the importance of executive privilege and the ability of Presidents and their advisers to reliably make and receive full and frank advice, without concern that communications will be publicly released to meet a political objective,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer, Jesse R. Binnall told the justices. He stressed that Congress had no valid legislative purpose for requesting the documents. \u201cCongress may not rifle through the confidential presidential papers of a former President to meet political objections,\u201d Binnall added. But the Biden administration argued that withholding the records based on executive privilege is not in the interest of the United States. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar said that in light of the \u201cextraordinary events\u201d of January 6, President Joe Biden had decided that that an assertion of executive privilege is \u201cnot justified.\u201d A federal appeals court ruled against Trump, holding that he \u201chas provided no basis for this court to override President Biden\u2019s judgment and the agreement and accommodations  worked out between the Political Branches over these documents.\u201d The court noted that the events \u201cmarked the most significant assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812,\u201d but agreed to freeze its ruling until the Supreme Court acted. \u201cUnder any of the tests advocated by former President Trump, the profound interests in disclosure advanced by President Biden and the January 6th Committee far exceed his generalized concerns for Executive Branch confidentiality,\u201d the panel of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit wrote. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court cited part of that sentence. \u201cBecause the Court of Appeals concluded that President Trump\u2019s claims would have failed even if he were the incumbent, his status as a former President necessarily made no difference to the court\u2019s decision,\u201d the Supreme Court said. \u201cTonight\u2019s ruling is a major setback for former President Trump in his efforts to block the National Archives from turning over documents to the January 6 Committee,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. \u201cAlthough the justices did not rule on whether the court of appeals correctly rejected his suit, by not blocking the handing over now, the justices have allowed that ruling to be the final word.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s order is a major blow to Trump, at a moment when the select committee is gaining steam as it gathers information from hundreds of witnesses and communications providers. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the panel, said Wednesday that she expects the committee will get the records from the Trump White House \u201cvery promptly\u201d and called the ruling \u201ca very big deal for getting the truth out.\u201d \u201cI was glad to see the court respected the decision made by the appellate court,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOut Front.\u201d Asked about the four pages of Trump documents that were set to be released from the National Archives on Wednesday, Lofgren said the panel has \u201cnot yet had a chance to look at it, but yes, the material is starting to flow in.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s order could also send a signal to other witnesses that they have very little ability to challenge January 6-related subpoenas on executive privilege grounds, potentially opening the possibility for more former White House officials to testify. The Supreme Court left unresolved key questions about an ex-President\u2019s ability to claim executive privilege \u2013 claims that top advisers of Trump have used to refuse or to hold off on testifying to the House. Currently, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is challenging subpoenas from the January 6 committee, in part because he said the questions about Trump\u2019s ability to assert privilege in the investigation as a former President remain unsettled. He also faces a five-week-old criminal contempt referral from the House to the Justice Department, though the DOJ has not filed any criminal charges. The DC Circuit\u2019s opinion in the Trump case last month undermined some of Meadows\u2019 arguments, but now the Supreme Court has scaled back the reach of that appellate opinion, saying that the DC Circuit\u2019s discussion of his status as a former president is not binding precedent. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, writing alone, said that he agreed with the court\u2019s decision to reject Trump\u2019s request, noting that the order was not based on Trump\u2019s status as a former President. But in a statement accompanying the court\u2019s ruling, the Trump nominee said he didn\u2019t agree with a suggestion by the appeals court that a former President may not invoke privilege over documents that occurred during his presidency. Here's what 'insurrection,' 'coup' and 'sedition' mean \u201cI respectfully disagree with the Court of Appeals on that point,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cA former president must be able to successfully invoke the Presidential communications privilege for communications that occurred during his Presidency even if the current President does not support the privilege claim,\u201d he said. Kavanaugh added, however, that to say that a former President can invoke privilege over such communications \u201cdoes not mean that the privilege is absolute or cannot be overcome.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.

            "article_content": "Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor has been listening to arguments remotely from her chambers because she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable sitting on the bench near colleagues who are not masked, including Justice Neil Gorsuch, according to a source familiar with the situation. In addition, Sotomayor has been participating in the justices-only conference sessions remotely, a court spokeswoman confirmed. Those sessions \u2013 where only the nine are allowed, no staff or hangers-on \u2013 is where the justices debate and essentially determine the legal direction of the country. Pissarro painting confiscated by Nazis at center of Supreme Court arguments Since January, amid the surge of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, all of the justices have worn masks on the bench, except for Gorsuch. In the ornate courtroom, he sits next to Sotomayor. Sotomayor, who suffers from diabetes as an underlying condition and would be at increased health risk if infected with Covid-19, participated in oral arguments on Tuesday remotely from her chambers, and did so again on Wednesday. In a rare joint statement Wednesday, Sotomayor and Gorsuch denied \u201creporting that Justice Sotomayor asked Justice Gorsuch to wear a mask surprised us. It is false. While we may sometimes disagree about the law, we are warm colleagues and friends.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts also issued a statement through the court\u2019s press office, saying: \u201cI did not request Justice Gorsuch or any other Justice to wear a mask on the bench.\u201d NPR first reported the reason for Sotomayor\u2019s decision to participate from her chambers. At the beginning of the term, Sotomayor wore a mask on the bench at many cases. Another source familiar with the situation said that after Omicron surged, Sotomayor expressed her concerns to Roberts. The source said she did not directly ask Gorsuch to wear a mask. She has participated remotely during arguments this month.. As the Supreme Court justices in their matching robes shuffled into court Tuesday to tackle the final set of cases in the January sitting, their bland expressions masked the unusual intensity of the term that is playing out behind the scenes. Not only are they furiously drafting opinions on explosive cases that have already been heard, but conservative groups \u2013 emboldened by the 6-3 conservative majority \u2013 also are pummeling them with requests to add even more divisive issues to the docket. And while the justices spent the first two weeks of the new year dealing with vaccine rules in the age of Covid, emergency requests \u2013 including on issues concerning abortion and former President Donald Trump\u2019s legal woes \u2013 have poured in. At oral arguments on Tuesday, all of the justices entered the courtroom wearing masks except for Gorsuch. Other conservative justices, including Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, occasionally took their masks off. The remaining two liberal justices on the bench, Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, kept their masks on even while asking questions. Gorsuch smiled as he entered the courtroom to take his seat on Tuesday, engaging in a brief conversation with Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who was masked. Sotomayor\u2019s chair remained empty, and she participated over the phone. The year Supreme Court conservatives made their mark Under Supreme Court rules, media covering the court proceedings and lawyers arguing before the court have to wear masks, but there are no specific rules regarding masks for justices. All of the justices have been fully vaccinated and received booster shots. They are also frequently tested. CNN has asked the court to comment on Gorsuch not wearing a mask and Sotomayor\u2019s decision to participate remotely. Another dynamic in play is whether Breyer \u2013 as is widely believed \u2013 will announce his retirement this term. If he were to retire, the vacancy and eventually new confirmation hearings would once again place the court in the spotlight during a politically fraught time, a midterm election year, calling even more attention to the direction of the court and calls for court revisions. More than one justice has remarked in the past that when one of them leaves, it changes the entire court. Already, the court has heard one of the most consequential cases in decades \u2013 a request from Mississippi to overturn Roe v. Wade and upend a woman\u2019s right to abortion, established decades ago. By now, the majority opinion has been assigned in the case, which was argued on December 1. At oral arguments, Roberts suggested a middle-ground petition that would allow Mississippi\u2019s law that bans abortion at 15 weeks to go into effect but leave Roe on the books. Although it didn\u2019t seem to attract a lot of attention from the right flank on argument day, it could prompt further discussion among the justices as the draft-writing process plays out. Ten days after that case was argued, in a different case the court allowed a Texas law that bans the procedure at six weeks to remain in effect. Although the court did clear a narrow path for abortion providers to challenge the law, supporters of abortion rights were left deeply dismayed for the future of those rights. While the justices at speaking events often talk about how much they value civility, the dissenters in the Texas case did not mince their words. \u201cThe court thus betrays not only the citizens of Texas, but also our constitutional system of government,\u201d Sotomayor wrote for her liberal colleagues. Those tensions emerged again at oral arguments on January 7, when Kagan pushed back at a lawyer challenging President Joe Biden\u2019s vaccine rules aimed at large employers. She was unusually animated: \u201cThis is a pandemic in which nearly a million people have died. It is by far the greatest public health danger that this country has faced in the last century. More and more people are dying every day. More and more people are getting sick every day. I don\u2019t mean to be dramatic here. I\u2019m just sort of stating facts.\u201d The court would end up blocking the requirement with all three liberals in dissent. While mulling over these cases and a full docket, the justices are also regularly meeting behind closed doors to consider whether to add cases to the docket \u2013 the meetings where Sotomayor is now calling in remotely. For two conferences already they have been discussing a pair of major affirmative action cases in appeals brought by a conservative group challenging the admissions policies at Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill which consider race. Again, the justices are being asked to overturn precedent \u2013 on an issue that deeply divides the public. Although they haven\u2019t acted on that request, last week they agreed to hear a case brought by a high school football coach who was barred by the school district from leading prayers at the 50-yard line after football games. They are also being asked to take up the case of a graphic designer who seeks to create websites to celebrate weddings but does not want to work with same-sex couples out of religious objections to same-sex marriage. In addition, Oklahoma is asking the court to reverse a recent decision holding that a large swath of the state \u2013 including parts of Tulsa \u2013 is Native American land for purposes of federal criminal law. Critically, Oklahoma likely believes it has a chance because since the 5-4 decision came down, Barrett has taken the seat of the late liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg. If the justices agree to take up the case, it will raise questions of whether precedent should be so swiftly reconsidered due to a change in the court\u2019s membership. The justices aren\u2019t just juggling their docket and pending cert petitions. They are also considering emergency applications asking them to act without full briefing on matters on an expedited basis. Texas abortion providers, for example, still reeling from the court\u2019s decision to allow the state\u2019s law to remain in effect, are asking the justices to demand that a conservative federal appeals court send what is left of the case back to a district judge who ruled in their favor during an earlier phase of the case. The justices have said nothing. Arizona wants the court to allow a law that prohibits doctors from providing abortions based on genetic abnormalities like Down syndrome to go into effect before an appeals court has fully dealt with the case. The high court has said nothing. Breyer phoned in to Supreme Court oral arguments Tuesday due to a false positive Covid test Lawyers for Trump are asking the justices to block release to a congressional committee of White House documents related to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. Trump argues the materials are protected under executive privilege even though the current President disagrees. The justices often say that while they disagree on paper, they pride themselves on civility. At a videoconference event last year with Sotomayor, Gorsuch noted that the court is composed of people from \u201call across the country\u201d with \u201cradically different life experiences\u201d who share a love for the country. More than that, Gorsuch added, his colleagues \u201creally love one another, respect one another and listen to one another.\u201d This story has been updated with Wednesday\u2019s statements from the court.",

            "article_content": "The National Archives plans to release four pages of Trump-era White House documents to the House on Wednesday, in what appears to be the first time the committee that\u2019s investigating the January 6 riot would get records that former President Donald Trump wants to keep secret. The documents are set to go to the House committee at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, according to a court filing from the Archives, which holds all of the Trump White House records. It\u2019s not clear what those four pages include, and should they be turned over, it would be up to the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol to make them public. New York attorney general's office says it has identified numerous 'misleading statements and omissions' in Trump Org. financial statements Trump has previously asked the Supreme Court to block the release of hundreds of pages of records related to January 6, arguing the documents are protected by executive privilege. The Biden White House, however, supports releasing the records to the House select committee, after determining the disclosure is in the nation\u2019s best interest and declining to assert executive privilege. The Supreme Court has not yet acted, and in the absence of word from the high court the sides are sparring over whether the Biden administration is handling the documents\u2019 release in good faith. Trump\u2019s legal team has ratcheted up its attacks of the Biden administration\u2019s position on releasing the four pages. As the deadline neared on Wednesday, Trump\u2019s team made public multiple letters to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals complaining of the plan. One letter called the Archives\u2019 decision \u201ccontemptuous behavior,\u201d and the Archives\u2019 choice to notify the court that four pages would be turned over an attempt to \u201cprophylactically inoculate itself and its officers from contempt proceedings.\u201d In another court filing on Wednesday morning, the National Archives, represented by the Biden Justice Department, said it wasn\u2019t intentionally misleading the court about its plan to turn over documents to the House, as Trump\u2019s team had accused them of doing. The Trump team, the Archives said, hadn\u2019t done what\u2019s needed in time to block the release of four pages being handed over. \u201cThe release of certain records from tranche four \u2013 that Appellant has known for over a month would occur today \u2013 will not violate any order of any court. Indeed, that is presumably why Appellant has asked the Supreme Court to enjoin release of documents from that tranche. The Supreme Court, however, has not acted on that request,\u201d lawyers for the administration wrote. Exclusive: Eric Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle's phone records subpoenaed by January 6 committee Even though Trump has not won in lower courts, the appellate court in DC has blocked the release of three tranches of documents pending action from the Supreme Court. The handful of pages the Archives is set to turn over Wednesday are part of a fourth tranche of records. An attorney for Trump, Jesse Binnall, responded defiantly in court early Wednesday to the Archives\u2019 plan to release four pages to the House. He said Trump\u2019s team would seek to hold the Biden administration in contempt of court if documents are turned over Wednesday. The lawyer also wrote that Trump\u2019s team believed the Biden administration was acting in bad faith. He accused the administration of planning to hand over to the House duplicates of records that are were processed earlier and clearly part of Trump\u2019s ongoing lawsuit before the Supreme Court, before Trump\u2019s team stepped in. The Biden administration said in its filing yesterday those records would not be handed over, instead reducing the amount headed to the House from six to four pages. \u201cUnder no circumstances should the government\u2019s misconduct and attempt to create an ad hoc record be sanctioned by this Court,\u201d Binnall wrote, according to the strongly worded filing. \u201cThe weighty issues being considered by the Supreme Court should be decided under the normal course, not by the government\u2019s attempt to bypass a lawful injunction.\u201d The select committee is seeking more than 700 pages of disputed documents as it explores Trump\u2019s role in trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election. That includes his appearance at a January 6 rally in which he directed followers to go to the US Capitol where lawmakers were set to certify the election results and \u201cfight\u201d for their county. The documents include activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 paperwork that could reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the Capitol, disrupting the certification of the 2020 vote. Trump is also seeking to keep secret a draft proclamation honoring two police officers who died in the siege and memos and other documents about supposed election fraud and efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s loss of the presidency, the National Archives has said in court documents. Broadly, the Trump White House records could answer some of the most closely guarded facts of what happened between Trump and other high-level officials, including those under siege on Capitol Hill on January 6.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 riot issued a subpoena Tuesday for Rudy Giuliani, a central figure in former President Donald Trump\u2019s failed bid to overturn the 2020 election on the basis of unfounded allegations of widespread voter fraud. In addition to Giuliani, the committee issued subpoenas to two other attorneys who pushed various election fraud conspiracies on Trump\u2019s behalf: Jenna Ellis and Sidney Powell. Former Trump campaign adviser Boris Epshteyn, who was among those working with Giuliani at the post-election Willard Hotel \u201ccommand center,\u201d was also subpoenaed Tuesday. \u201cThe four individuals we\u2019ve subpoenaed today advanced unsupported theories about election fraud, pushed efforts to overturn the election results, or were in direct contact with the former President about attempts to stop the counting of electoral votes,\u201d Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, said in a statement Tuesday. The subpoenas mark a significant escalation in the sweeping probe as the committee is now seeking to compel cooperation from those at the heart of Trump\u2019s push to overturn the election predicated on the lie that it was stolen. The panel has an entire investigative team dedicated to examining efforts by Trump and his allies to pressure Department of Justice officials, as well as those at the state level, to overturn the results of the election. A running list of who has received a subpoena or request to appear from the House January 6 select committee Giuliani\u2019s attorney, Robert Costello, tells CNN that the House select committee subpoenaing his client amounts to \u201cpolitical theater\u201d and indicated that his client doesn\u2019t plan to provide information because he has claims of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege. Costello also said Giuliani has not yet received the subpoena and that the committee had not sought his voluntary cooperation before issuing one. Costello said the fact that the media got the subpoena letter before his client \u201cshows you this is political theater, not really an investigation of facts.\u201d \u201cChairman Bennie Thompson, who is not a lawyer, should realize that Giuliani has a claim of executive privilege and a claim of attorney-client privilege,\u201d Costello said. Costello added that it\u2019s \u201chard to believe\u201d that the committee \u201cis going to end up with any substantive information from Mr. Giuliani.\u201d \u201cWhen you are asking questions of the president\u2019s personal attorney, you are not going to get answers. They want to try to make an example of him,\u201d Costello said. Costello also represents former White House strategist Steve Bannon, who is facing criminal contempt charges for defying a subpoena from the committee. Powell said in a statement through her attorney Wednesday that she will appear before the House Select Committee and answer questions. But her attorney, Howard Kleinhendler, reiterated that Powell, also an attorney, still believes there was election fraud. Epshteyn said in a statement Tuesday he was not surprised by the committee\u2019s subpoena but called the panel \u201cillegitimate.\u201d Also Tuesday, CNN exclusively reported that the committee has subpoenaed and obtained records of phone numbers associated with one of Trump\u2019s children, Eric Trump, as well as Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is engaged to Donald Trump Jr. After the 2020 presidential election and up until the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, Giuliani was integral to the unsuccessful legal apparatus Trump and his allies created to try and overturn election results by alleging false claims of election fraud.  Giuliani traveled the country and worked behind the scenes to pressure state lawmakers to overturn election results. Giuliani and Powell both have been subject to sanctions and lawsuits over their efforts for Trump to claim election fraud in court by filing lawsuits in key states after the 2020 vote. Legal authorities have said that effort was an intentional disinformation campaign, meant to prime Trump supporters to lose faith in the electoral results. After the election, Giuliani was in high-level meetings with Trump advisers. In its letters to Giuliani and Powell, the committee references witness testimony and public reporting to state that they \u201curged President Trump to direct the seizure of voting machines around the country after being told that the Department of Homeland Security had no lawful authority to do so.\u201d CNN has previously reported that in December 2020, Giuliani asked former DHS official Ken Cuccinelli whether the department could seize voting machines in certain states to be reexamined for evidence of widespread voter fraud. Cuccinelli, who CNN previously reported has spoken to the committee, said in October that he told Giuliani the department had no legal authority to seize voting machines or interfere with state-run elections. Cuccinelli also said that \u201cno one at any level pushed us to do anything outside of our existing mission sets.\u201d Trump in December briefly toyed with the idea that Powell could become a special counsel to him, making it possible for his administration to seize voting machines. Powell appears to have stepped away from being in Trump\u2019s closest circle in the immediate days leading up to January 6. Both have previously attempted to claim information about their work related to Trump should stay confidential, raising the possibility of a fight over privileges with the House. Ex-New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik provides documents to January 6 committee The panel also asks Powell in its letter to provide the evidence she used to promote claims of election fraud both in court and in public forums. Investigators have been asking witnesses about Giuliani and Powell during previous closed-door interviews but now want to hear directly from the former Trump attorneys. According to a source familiar with his testimony, former New York Police Commissioner Bernie Kerik was asked last week about Giuliani and he had defended the former New York mayor as legitimately believing there was at least \u201cprobable cause\u201d of voter fraud that should be investigated and not a \u201cbig lie.\u201d Kerik worked alongside Giuliani in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election to find any evidence of voter fraud that would swing it for Trump. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election. Lawmakers were also asking about Powell and how she was separated from the Trump legal team. The panel references the public reporting on Ellis revealing that she wrote memos outlining how she believed then-Vice President Mike Pence could reject electoral college votes and overturn the 2020 election, including one theory that he could ignore a federal law. To Epshteyn, the committee cites public reports that show the former Trump campaign adviser was on a call with Trump on the morning of January 6 where \u201coptions were discussed to delay the certification of election results in light of Pence\u2019s unwillingness to deny or delay certification.\u201d Epshteyn was also at the Willard Hotel in Washington where Trump advisers discussed options for overturning the election results. In his statement announcing the subpoenas, Thompson calls on these four witnesses to cooperate with the panel\u2019s investigation. \u201cWe expect these individuals to join the nearly 400 witnesses who have spoken with the Select Committee as the committee works to get answers for the American people about the violent attack on our democracy,\u201d Thompson said. While hundreds of witnesses are cooperating with the panel, it continues to face stonewalling tactics from an inner circle of key Trump allies.

            "article_content": "Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is urging the Supreme Court to take up former President Donald Trump\u2019s case aiming to keep secret records from his presidency about efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection \u2013 as he, like Trump, tries to evade a House select committee\u2019s investigation into the attack on the US Capitol. In a brief filed Friday, Meadows, who is facing a potential criminal contempt charge for failing to comply with the House January 6 committee\u2019s subpoena, argued that the Supreme Court should allow former presidents to have a say in the secrecy of the executive branch and that the high court should put limits on what he claimed is an ever-expanding approach to congressional investigations. In his lawsuit, Trump claimed executive privilege should allow him to block the select committee from getting some of the documents from the National Archives, the custodian of his administration\u2019s White House records. President Joe Biden has diverged from Trump\u2019s claims and decided the Archives should hand over the documents. \u201cWhat sets this case apart is the undisputed fact that, under the Presidential Records Act, President Biden has no authority to disclose President Trump\u2019s records on his own, just as under the Constitution, Congress has no authority to compel the production of the privileged material,\u201d said Meadows\u2019 amicus brief, from his legal team at the law firm McGuireWoods. \u201cUnless the Court steps in to say otherwise, Presidential advisors will henceforth need to assume that it only takes a party-change in the Presidency and a sympathetic Committee Chairman in Congress to compel disclosure of their advice and other Presidential communications.\u201d Meadows\u2019 brief also dings the House committee for its members who have publicly discussed the possibility of criminal referrals emerging from their probe. \u201cUnless this Court steps in, the Select Committee\u2019s investigation will represent the greatest expansion of Congress\u2019s power to investigate and target private citizens since the days of the House Un-American Activities Committee,\u201d wrote the team defending Meadows, who is a former Republican member of Congress. The federal appeals court in DC that ruled against Trump in December signed off on the legitimacy of the House probe. Meadows also told the Supreme Court that he believes it should hear Trump\u2019s case because it has implications for several witnesses the House committee has subpoenaed for documents. Meadows and more than a dozen others have sued separately to challenge the committee, and those cases are in their earliest stages before trial-level judges. Meadows said in his case that if he answered any question the committee asked him or turned over all documents its members want, he could be revealing information Trump is trying to keep secret. \u201cFormer officials are thus left to navigate conflicting instructions from the incumbent President and the former President under whom they served. If they follow President Biden\u2019s direction and provide privileged testimony to Congress, they effectively moot President Trump\u2019s assertion of Executive Privilege\u2014 as well as this Court\u2019s opportunity to clarify waiver of privilege held by former Presidents,\u201d Meadows\u2019 lawyers wrote. \u201cIf they follow President Trump\u2019s direction and defy a subpoena without first seeking judicial recourse (as [Meadows] has), they face the prospect of prosecution.\u201d The House has asked the Justice Department to prosecute Meadows for contempt of Congress for failing to testify, but he has not been charged. The House also wants the Supreme Court to look at Trump\u2019s requests in the case quickly. The committee is working toward a goal of releasing an interim report with initial findings by the summer. By keeping the executive privilege questions in court, Trump has so far delayed the release of documents and chilled witnesses responding to the House\u2019s subpoenas since the fall.",

            "article_content": "January 6, 2021 started like lots of days on Capitol Hill for CNN reporter Daniella Diaz. She was braced for a very long day as Congress was set to formalize Joe Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory. What transpired over the next 21 hours \u2013 rioters storming the US Capitol in an attempted coup \u2013 was history in the making. On the anniversary of that fateful day, I reached out to Daniella to talk about her recollections \u2013 and what memories have stayed with her. Our conversation \u2013 conducted via email and lightly edited for flow \u2013 is below. Cillizza: Describe the mood at the Capitol when you arrived for work on January 6. Were people aware of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally? Worried about it? Diaz: For me, I thought it was just going to be another normal day on the congressional beat. I\u2019ve grown accustomed to the long days that come with this job and I didn\u2019t think this day would be any different. I was prepared to work late \u2013 I just didn\u2019t realize when I arrived at the Capitol at 9 a.m. on Jan. 6 that it would also mean evacuating my workspace and hiding in another location just a few hours later. As for the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, I wasn\u2019t concerned at all. There are protests around the Capitol all the time. It\u2019s one of the reasons being a congressional reporter is so special \u2013 the constant reminder of the freedom of speech surrounding the building you work in every day. But as I watched CNN\u2019s coverage of the protest, I started gathering the day would be different. Cillizza: At what point did it become clear to you that this wasn\u2019t going to be a normal day on the Hill?  Was it a single moment or a series of moments? Diaz: It was a series of moments. In my workspace on the House side of the Capitol building, I could see the protestors outside the building. And as I covered the joint session of Congress to certify the election results, I kept glancing outside to see where the protestors were and each time I looked, they were closer to the Capitol building. There were thousands of them. At the time I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s no way they\u2019ll come into the building.\u201d I was wrong. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! I\u2019ll never forget the moment when police came into our workspace and told us we couldn\u2019t move because rioters were in the building. That was the moment I knew the day wasn\u2019t normal anymore. The staff locked the doors and within moments we heard the rioters in the hallways outside the workspace. It took all of 5 minutes for that to happen. Cillizza: Where were you when the rioters actually entered the building? Did you stay there or did you go somewhere else? Diaz: I stayed in the CNN House booth (a closet-sized space where we work when we\u2019re at the Capitol) for a few hours until police rushed in and evacuated us to another Capitol building through the basement tunnels. The rioters were just outside our workspace in the hallways of the Capitol but the wooden doors were thick and locked and they were never able to come in. Cillizza: How long did it all last?  At what point were you able to sort of go back to \u201cnormal\u201d? A lot of that time for me is a blur but I remember being in the workspace in the Capitol until around 3:30 p.m. when police ran in and told us we only had a few minutes to evacuate. I gathered my stuff as fast as I could and ran out with the dozen or so reporters and staff who were locked in with me. Then we stayed in another location in another Capitol building for about four more hours waiting for the all-clear to return to the Capitol. I continued to text sources and send in reporting of what I was hearing was happening. My work never stopped. Around 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 6, police escorted us back into the Capitol building through the underground tunnels. As I walked back into the Capitol building, I saw the destruction by the Capitol rioters \u2013 windows were broken, trash was everywhere. I didn\u2019t know the extent of the damage until later. When I reached the CNN House booth, I dropped off my stuff and then I ran downstairs to outside the House chamber and took video of staffers cleaning the House chamber. It was hard for me to see the damage the rioters left on the historic Capitol building and watch custodial staff who keep the Capitol running every day clean it up. Reporter describes moment Jan. 6 rioters realized he was with CNN After a few more hours the joint session resumed and I kept working. Around 4 a.m. on Jan. 7 is when Congress adjourned. I was stuck at the Capitol for a few more hours after that trying to find a way home because the city was on lockdown. I didn\u2019t get home until 6:30 a.m. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cMy lasting memory of January 6 is __________.\u201d Now, explain. Diaz: \u201cMy lasting memory of January 6 is watching Capitol staff clean up the damage.\u201d In just a few hours, mainly white rioters stormed the Capitol and desecrated the People\u2019s House. And hours later, the brown and Black custodial staff who work there every day and keep the beautiful building running cleaned it all up. It\u2019s something that stays with me and reminds me of the privilege certain people have in this country. It\u2019s something I will never forget.",

            "article_content": "Two weeks before becoming president, Joe Biden watched the January 6 attack on television from his home in Delaware, horrified as the unspeakable images of the insurrection unfolded and aghast at the sitting President\u2019s unwillingness to condemn it. A year later, he marked that day with a speech that put into stark terms what the event meant for a nation still deeply split over its significance \u2013 and excoriating his predecessor for his role in eroding American democracy. In his speech from the Capitol\u2019s Statuary Hall on Thursday, the President wielded the sharpest language he\u2019s ever used about the attempted coup, denouncing \u201cthe former President\u201d 16 times for lying about the election because he couldn\u2019t reckon with losing. \u201cHe\u2019s not just a former President,\u201d Biden said in his forceful remarks, \u201che\u2019s a defeated former President.\u201d Biden touched upon his deeply personal views of the assault on democracy and the attack on the hallowed Capitol building where he spent nearly four decades during his time as a senator. But he also acknowledged it wasn\u2019t a battle he necessarily expected or sought. \u201cI did not seek this fight, brought to this Capitol one year ago today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I will not shrink from it either. I will stand in this breach, I will defend this nation, I will allow no one to place a dagger at the throat of democracy.\u201d Biden worked over the holidays to write and refine an address that was bluntly honest about the motivations and consequences of the riot, along with the threats to American democracy that still persist. It\u2019s a topic that drives Biden, according to officials, but one that hasn\u2019t played a central role in his public agenda. He has left investigating the riot to Congress and made clear he won\u2019t interject into the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of its perpetrators. Still, the January 6 riot has doggedly shadowed Biden\u2019s first year in office. The insurrection was unsuccessful in preventing him from becoming president, but it has instead become a persistent reminder of the divisions he once promised to heal and the fraught political environment in which he governs. Biden has made attempts to bridge those divisions by doing what he can to move on. Even as many Democrats warn of troubling steps taken around the country that could potentially undermine future elections \u2013 including installing loyalists to Donald Trump on election boards and changing local voting laws \u2013 the President spent his first year in office prioritizing other legislative battles, including Covid relief money, an infrastructure bill and a large social and climate spending package that is still pending. Mindful of not allowing Trump to hijack his presidency, Biden has made it a habit not to mention his predecessor by name, though he still does sometimes. He recently claimed, \u201cI don\u2019t think about the former President.\u201d Yet Trump\u2019s influence has persisted, including in Congress where January 6 has become an enduring test of loyalty to the former President. While Trump canceled a news conference scheduled for Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, he continues to spread false information about the election at rallies and during media appearances. Trump\u2019s false claims about the election and the riot continue to undermine Biden among Republicans around the country. This week, an NPR/Ipsos poll found two-thirds of Republicans agree that fraud helped Biden win \u2013 a claim that has repeatedly been discredited. One year ago on that January afternoon, Biden was two weeks away from being sworn in as president and was scheduled to give a speech on the economy. Those remarks were delayed for more than two hours as a paralyzed nation viewed the violence with horror and disbelief. That day, Biden told one of his closest aides that his transition to power \u2013 and likely his presidency \u2013 had just become markedly more difficult. It was a rare exception during his two months as president-elect when Biden directly raised Trump\u2019s name during a public speech, demanding he call off his loyal followers. \u201cAt this hour, our democracy\u2019s under unprecedented assault, unlike anything we\u2019ve seen in modern times. An assault on the citadel of liberty, the Capitol itself,\u201d Biden said, before imploring Trump \u201cto fulfill his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege.\u201d Fourteen days later in his inaugural address, delivered from the very spot of the rampage, Biden sought to use the deadly riot as a teachable moment for the nation, striking an optimistic note that a divided nation could come together. \u201cWe have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility,\u201d Biden said. \u201cMuch to repair, much to restore, much to heal.\u201d On that day, memories of the Capitol breach were still fresh among the lawmakers and other officials who gathered on West Front. At the time, nerves in Washington were raw from the violence, razor-topped fencing surrounded the Capitol complex and 25,000 National Guardsmen were patrolling the city as fears of more violence persisted. Since that moment, though, the lie undermining Biden\u2019s victory over Trump has grown beyond any expectation. The anniversary speech that Biden delivered on Thursday was far more pointed. \u201cFor the first time in our history, a president not just lost an election, he tried to prevent the peaceful transfer of power as a violent mob breached the Capitol,\u201d Biden said, repeatedly using some of the words Trump is known to dislike \u2013 \u201clost,\u201d \u201cdefeated\u201d and \u201cfailed: \u2013 to deliver a blistering attack on his predecessor. \u201cWe must be absolutely clear about what is true and what is a lie. Here\u2019s the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe former President of the United States of America has spread a web of lies about the 2020 election.\u201d Asked as he was departing the Capitol Building why he did not use Trump\u2019s name, Biden said he was aiming for something larger. \u201cI did not want to turn it into a contemporary political battle between me and the President,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s way beyond that.\u201d As Biden nears the one-year mark of his presidency, the change in tone underscores one of the biggest surprises of the office: Trump, whom he defeated 306 to 232 electoral votes, looms far larger than the predecessor of any modern-day president. The opening weeks of Biden\u2019s presidency shared a spotlight with Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial in the Senate, where the Republican was ultimately acquitted after Democrats accused him of inciting the riot at the Capitol. In other ways, January 6 has continued to arise at regular intervals. The event has seeped into his diplomatic conversations. Biden has cited fellow world leaders who he says ask him regularly whether American democracy will survive its current strains: \u201cIs America going to be all right?\u201d he claims his counterparts ask him at foreign summits and over the phone. When lawmakers were in the process of forming a committee to investigate the attack in the spring, Biden voiced support for the efforts but otherwise sought to put distance between himself and the process, insisting the decisions on the panel\u2019s makeup and mission were best left to members of Congress. Biden and his team have generally rejected Trump\u2019s claims that all internal White House documents should be shielded by executive privilege. They have argued in legal letters it is \u201cnot in the best interests of the United States\u201d for Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege to stand. Yet White House lawyers have also sought to keep a certain number of records the committee has requested from becoming public, arguing their release could harm national security. Those records had been the subject of negotiations between the top White House lawyer and the committee and were an indication of the inherent tension between two different branches of government. Biden himself has weighed in only sporadically on the proceedings. After saying in October that he thought the Justice Department should prosecute former Trump aide Steve Bannon for failing to comply with a committee subpoena, Biden said it was not appropriate for him to have voiced his opinion. Last month, he said former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows was \u201cworthy of being held in contempt\u201d for similarly failing to appear for a deposition. Behind the scenes, Biden has been kept abreast of the committee\u2019s work but isn\u2019t focused intensely on it, according to aides. He has placed greater importance on strengthening voter protections and ensuring future elections aren\u2019t subject to false challenges. Democrats are looking to use the January 6 anniversary as a launching point to advance voting rights legislation, which has been stalled for the past year. Activists are pushing for Biden to reorient his strategy in the new year to pass something by the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday in mid-January. Doing so would likely require altering Senate rules to overcome Republican opposition. White House officials say Biden will touch on voting rights in his speech Thursday, but intends to address the topic in a far more substantive way next week during a trip to Atlanta, the cradle of the civil rights movement. He and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to visit Georgia on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection is cranking up the pace ahead of Thursday\u2019s anniversary of the mob attack, training its sights on ex-Vice President Mike Pence and Donald Trump\u2019s top Fox News booster Sean Hannity. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson on Tuesday called on Pence to voluntarily speak to the panel about what he knew about the attempt by the then-President and his advisers to convince him to go back on his constitutional duty to certify President Joe Biden\u2019s election win. The Mississippi Democrat also wants Pence\u2019s take on the fraught moments when he was in the Capitol and a pro-Trump mob was chanting for him to be hanged during the mayhem that raged a year ago. \u201cI would hope that he would do the right thing and come forward and voluntarily talk to the committee,\u201d Thompson told CNN. The January 6 committee formed 6 months ago. Here's what it's uncovered. The request once again puts Pence on the politically perilous tightrope between incurring the wrath of Trump and his supporters and the rule of law. The idea that the former vice president would voluntarily throw himself back into the controversy by testifying appears far-fetched, however. He has painstakingly spent the last year putting space between himself and the infamy of January 6 as he struggles to keep himself viable for a possible future Republican presidential campaign. Still, various Pence aides have begun engaging with the committee, including his former chief of staff Marc Short, whom CNN reported last month is cooperating. Thompson spoke to CNN moments after the committee fired off another request for cooperation, calling on Hannity, a prime-time Fox News opinion star, to discuss dozens of texts it says he sent to Trump and the President\u2019s team in the days surrounding January 6. The messages once again lay bare the propagandistic synergy between the conservative network and the Trump White House. It also suggests that the panel is willing to go after the most high-profile witnesses and brave significant political controversy in its quest to tell the story of January 6. These developments are just the latest sign of momentum for the committee. According to a new court filing on Tuesday, the panel obtained the financial records of Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich in late December. The documents appear to fit into the panel\u2019s attempts to trace the source of funding of the rally on the Ellipse in Washington, DC, on January 6, where Trump told the crowd to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to keep him in power, which later evolved into the violent invasion of the Capitol. Earlier this week, leading members of the panel indicated they had received testimony from inside Trump\u2019s West Wing on the day of the insurrection, focusing on the then-President\u2019s failure to do more to stop the attack by his supporters. Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, revealed that there was \u201cfirsthand\u201d testimony that Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, then a White House official, twice asked her father to call off the rioters. The disclosure shed fresh light on Trump\u2019s decision-making and dereliction of duty in failing to defend the Capitol and the constitutional process of ratifying an election. Fast-moving developments from the committee add a new dimension to a series of vigils that are set to be held on Capitol Hill on Thursday to mark one year since the worst attack on US democracy in modern history. Biden will give an address that the White House says will \u201cspeak to the truth\u201d of what happened when Trump supporters seeking to steal his presidency roamed the Capitol, sending lawmakers fleeing for their lives. The legitimately elected President will stress the peril posed to the rule of law and the US system of democratic governance \u2013 which has arguably only increased during Trump\u2019s relentless campaign of lies over the last year. Fact check: Five enduring lies about the Capitol insurrection The defeated ex-President had planned what was likely to be a day of counterprograming filled with falsehoods. But he suddenly announced on Tuesday that he was canceling a Thursday news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida that would likely have cast his conduct and constitutional arson in an even poorer light. Progress signaled by the committee in recent days appears to increase the possibility that it will succeed in creating the most authoritative narrative yet of the events that led up to the insurrection and who was responsible. But it remains a long shot to change the political dynamic surrounding the attack, following a year in which Trump and his Republicans have whitewashed the history of the assault. The GOP is still trying to blame House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the security lapses on the day of the attack, even though she doesn\u2019t control the US Capitol Police. And Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota on Tuesday sought to paint commemorative events scheduled for Capitol Hill as a partisan exercise. \u201cI think they will try to politicize the event, you know, they\u2019ve been doing that all week.\u201d Thompson told CNN in an interview that there had been no formal request for Pence to discuss the events of January 6 with the committee, which was set up after Republicans backed out of a plan to hold an independent commission on the insurrection. \u201cBut if he offered, we\u2019d gladly accept. Everything is under consideration,\u201d said Thompson, who heads a committee that has issued subpoenas to a long list of other Trump aides that were wanted for depositions. \u201cHis life was at risk,\u201d the Mississippi Democrat said of Pence. \u201cThere were people who had gallows erected on the lawn of the Capitol ostensibly to hang the vice president. There were people on them threatening the life of the vice president. The vice president could not leave the Capitol of the United States because of the riot.\u201d Trump hit with two new lawsuits from police officers attacked by rioters on January 6 Thompson said he wanted to gain an understanding of why Trump was so late to act to quell the riot even though his vice president\u2019s life appeared to be at risk. \u201cWe\u2019d like to know what his security detail told him was going on,\u201d Thompson said. Given the political stakes for Pence, it seems unlikely that committee members believe he would cooperate. If that is the case, this could be yet another example of savvy political messaging that the committee has used to focus attention on its work \u2013 even as Trump does his best to obstruct it. The committee\u2019s interest in speaking with Pence comes amid signs that his inner circle has been more open in engaging with the investigation. Besides Short, CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel revealed on Monday that Pence\u2019s ex-national security adviser Keith Kellogg, who was with Trump in the White House during the assault on Congress, had given a deposition. And according to sources familiar with the discussions, some Pence aides have been proving more willing to engage with the committee than previously made public. The revelations are likely to infuriate Trump, who demands a strongman\u2019s absolute loyalty from subordinates even when it leads them into dangerous legal territory. It may also further fracture the relationship between the former President and his vice president. As he prepares the groundwork for a possible political comeback, Pence has taken pains to avoid talking about January 6, when he rejected Trump\u2019s entreaties to subvert the constitutional process that certified Biden\u2019s 2020 election victory. As he addressed Republicans in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire last summer, Pence tried to draw a line on his clash with Trump on January 6, but also to claim a share of credit for his administration\u2019s achievements. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever see eye to eye on that day. But I will always be proud of what we accomplished for the American people for the last four years,\u201d Pence said. It was always a long shot that Pence would be able to pull off such a straddle in a party that is still dominated by the ex-President and his almost mythical hold over the GOP base and congressional Republicans. That task would be even more unlikely if he cooperated with the January 6 select committee. And the next few days, as they refocus public attention on the chaos and violence of a year ago, are going to be deeply uncomfortable for Pence as it is. Hannity also finds himself in an awkward position after the committee asked him for voluntary cooperation. The request centers partly on what the panel says are text messages from Hannity pushing back on the plan drawn up by Trump\u2019s legal team to challenge the certification of Biden\u2019s election victory on January 6. The texts appear to show Hannity casting doubt on the plan and urging Trump to prepare for a departure from office. The committee said it appeared that Hannity has \u201cdetailed knowledge regarding President Trump\u2019s state of mind,\u201d and engaged with the then-President numerous times. The messages are apparently among those sent to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, which he turned over to the committee when he was cooperating with the investigation. Meadows has since declined to testify, citing executive privilege \u2013 a move that earned him a contempt of Congress citation by the Democratic-led House. The disclosures are embarrassing for both men. Meadows now appears to have offered the committee a chance to burrow deep into Trump\u2019s inner circle. While Hannity\u2019s doubts about Trump\u2019s strategy show that at least one of the President\u2019s supporters was dwelling in reality, they could also undercut his own strategy of acting as Trump\u2019s cheerleader-in-chief and potentially damage him in the eyes of the former President\u2019s supporters. The texts that show Hannity strategizing Trump\u2019s exit also yet again expose the extraordinarily close relationship between Fox and the ex-President\u2019s White House that clearly infringes journalistic ethics but has been mutually beneficially. Hannity\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, told CNN that the Fox star\u2019s camp was \u201creviewing the committee\u2019s letter and will respond as appropriate.\u201d Ryan Nobles, Annie Grayer, Paula Reid, Angelica Grimaldi, Alex Rogers, Gloria Borger, Katelyn Polantz and Ted Barrett contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee probing the January 6 insurrection is signaling that it has penetrated Donald Trump\u2019s wall of obstruction about what was going on inside the White House and his own family while he refused to stop the mob attack on the US Capitol a year ago this week. Revelations delivered on Sunday by the top two lawmakers on the committee offer the clearest sign yet that it can get to the truth about the violence Trump incited to further his coup attempt, which turned into the worst assault on American democracy in modern times. And a person familiar with the inquiry told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel that one of the key witnesses who has given testimony is Keith Kellogg, former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s national security adviser, who was with Trump in the White House as the riot raged. Committee chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the panel has \u201csignificant testimony\u201d that shows the White House was told to \u201cdo something\u201d as the crowd of Trump supporters fired up by his election fantasies smashed their way into the Capitol. Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, told ABC News of \u201cfirsthand testimony\u201d that Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, then a West Wing adviser, twice asked him to intervene in a melee in which police officers were beaten by his crowd. The source also told CNN\u2019s Gangel that the committee has texts and other documents that show what the President was doing and not doing at the time, including some from former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The new details about there being first-hand information from inside the West Wing serve as a warning to Trump that his relentless efforts to hide the truth about a day that will live in infamy may not work. And it may deter other witnesses from holding out against the committee. Thursday\u2019s anniversary will revisit the horrors of the attack, before which Trump had told his supporters to \u201cfight like hell\u201d in support of his conspiracy to steal power from Joe Biden in violation of the will of the people expressed in a democratic election. The January 6 committee formed 6 months ago. Here's what it's uncovered. And now the comments from committee leadership shed fresh light on the motivation behind the ex-President\u2019s quest to keep secret documentary evidence of his role on January 6, which has reached all the way to the US Supreme Court. They also explain the refusal of several of Trump\u2019s closest aides and acolytes to talk to the committee about what exactly he was doing in the Oval Office. It is increasingly clear that those appearances might force them to choose between telling the truth under oath and crossing their old boss, who still dominates the GOP. Two such Trump allies \u2013 Meadows and his former political guru Steve Bannon \u2013 have already received criminal contempt referrals to the Justice Department from the committee and the full House. Bannon faces trial in July. Meadows has provided documentary evidence to the committee but has halted cooperation. But this week\u2019s events will also underscore that a year on, Trump\u2019s enormous power over the GOP and the complicity of many of its top leaders in his voting fraud lies means that US democracy is in deeper trouble and under broader assault than ever. Thompson\u2019s and Cheney\u2019s comments will also fuel a growing impression that the committee, which has conducted several hundred interviews, has built a detailed behind-the-scenes picture of what went on inside Trump\u2019s West Wing on an infamous day in US history. Some of that evidence has already emerged in journalistic accounts of what went on during the insurrection. But the committee\u2019s eventual final report would have the capacity to create a definitive record for history \u2013 and for future voters \u2013 on the truth about the attack. There were additional signs on Sunday that the committee is making inroads into tracing the funding of the rally at the Ellipse in Washington, DC, that Trump addressed with his inflammatory lies about election fraud on January 6. Thompson raised concerns on \u201cState of the Union\u201d about the possibility of financial fraud in relation to the event. Why the new legal attack from Trump allies against the House January 6 committee is a long shot \u201cWe have not made those concerns public at this point. But we do think it\u2019s highly concerning on our part that people raised monies for one activity, and we can\u2019t find the money being spent for that particular activity,\u201d he said. The chairman also notably refused to rule out the notion that the committee could take the extraordinary step of making a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department. While it is not clear if the full committee would be on board for such a move, it would raise the prospect of the attorney general of one administration considering an indictment of the President from the previous White House, a conundrum that could pour more fuel on a raging political inferno in a midterm election year. \u201cWe don\u2019t know \u2026 If there\u2019s anything we come upon as a committee that we think would warrant a referral to the Department of Justice, we\u2019ll do that,\u201d Thompson told Dana Bash. Cheney added on CBS that Trump was guilty of a \u201csupreme dereliction of duty\u201d and that the committee was looking at whether there was a need for \u201cenhanced penalties\u201d for such behavior, though she appeared to be referring to legislation that would not likely be retrospective in relation to Trump\u2019s conduct. Cheney did, however, warn that Trump\u2019s conduct was so egregious that he should not be allowed anywhere near power again, as the former President considers a potential new tilt at the White House in 2024. \u201cThis is a man who has demonstrated that he\u2019s at war with the rule of law. He\u2019s demonstrated that he\u2019s willing to blow through every guardrail of democracy,\u201d Cheney said on CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \u201cAnd he can never be anywhere near the Oval Office again.\u201d On the face of it, a refusal by the commander in chief to intervene to stop an assault on the citadel of American democracy during the process of certifying Biden\u2019s election is a clear infringement of his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. But even a deeply damning report by the committee would seem unlikely to break the dynamic of denial in the GOP over Trump\u2019s transgressions. In the year since the US Capitol attack, judges remind us what it means to be American A new poll, for example, from the Washington Post and the University of Maryland shows that only 27% of Republicans believe that the former President deserves \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cgood amount\u201d of blame for the attack on the Capitol on January 6. Such data, which reflects a year of lies by Trump and conservative media, helps explain why the House GOP especially has anchored its hopes of capturing a majority in the midterm elections on fealty to the insurrectionist ex-President. Apart from Cheney and the other Republican on the select committee, Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, much of the Republican conference is participating in or abetting the whitewashing of history. Trump has already announced he will give fresh impetus to a process that has convinced millions of grassroots supporters of the lie that he was cheated out of power and should still be president, with a press conference at his luxury Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Thursday. The ex-President plans to argue that the real insurrection took place during the November 2020 election \u2013 which Biden won in a free and fair vote \u2014 not on January 6, even though the attack on the Capitol took place in front of the eyes of the world and there\u2019s no evidence of election fraud in 2020. The committee is bearing down on what it says are the crucial 187 minutes between the start of the Capitol insurrection and Trump issuing a message to supporters to go home. Thompson hinted there are signs that the ex-President tried to tape several previous messages but his words did not apparently sufficiently meet the moment and were not released by the White House. That is one reason why the committee wants the Supreme Court to allow it to examine documents, texts, emails and memos over which Biden has declined to assert executive privilege but which Trump does not want to be handed over. After several previous reversals in court, the ex-President in the days before Christmas appealed to the conservative majority on the Supreme Court that he helped build. 'It's not a silver bullet': Democrats weigh how to talk about January 6 on the 2022 campaign trail \u201cWe have significant testimony that leads us to believe that the White House had been told to do something,\u201d Thompson told Bash Sunday. \u201cWe want to verify all of it, so that, when we produce our report and when we have the hearings, the public will have an opportunity to see for themselves.\u201d The chairman added: \u201cThe only thing I can say, it\u2019s highly unusual for anyone in charge of anything to watch what\u2019s going on and do nothing.\u201d Cheney also weighed in on those crucial moments, fleshing out reporting contained in the books \u201cI Alone Can Fix It\u201d by Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker and \u201cPeril\u201d by Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. \u201cWe know his daughter \u2013 we have firsthand testimony that his daughter Ivanka went in at least twice to ask him to \u2018please stop this violence,\u2019\u201d Cheney told ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week.\u201d Cheney\u2019s willingness to pursue the truth of January 6, which sets her apart from many of her fellow House Republicans, has seen her ostracized by her party. She lost a leadership post in the House Republican conference and is being challenged by a Trump-backed primary challenger. But she still expressed hope on CBS on Sunday that a committee trashed by Trump\u2019s allies on Capitol Hill could produce evidence with the power to change the minds of skeptics. She also had a challenge for her party, much of which long ago chose to shield Trump and disregard the truth for political gain. \u201cOur party has to choose. We can either be loyal to Donald Trump or we can be loyal to the Constitution, but we cannot be both,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.

E. Danya Perry, a founding partner of Perry Guha LLP, formerly served as a federal prosecutor and chief of investigations for New York State\u2019s Moreland Commission on Public Corruption. Dennis Aftergut, a former federal prosecutor, is currently of counsel to Lawyers Defending American Democracy. The views in this commentary belong to the authors. View more opinion at CNN. The search warrant executed on former President Donald Trump\u2019s premises at Mar-a-Lago represents a seismic shift in the overall landscape of the investigations against him. We have long forecast his deepening legal peril, but this puts an exclamation point on his exposure. As a nation, we are now rapidly headed into barely charted waters. While the facts are just beginning to emerge, we know that on Monday morning a group of FBI agents executed a search warrant and conducted an exacting examination of the property, including accessing a safe, according to Trump, and leaving with a quantity of documents, according to a CNN source. Trump reacted with predictable outrage, claiming that his home was \u201cunder siege, raided, and occupied\u201d and that \u201cNothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before.\u201d He\u2019s correct on that last point. But we have never seen evidence of this kind of behavior by a president before either. CNN is reporting that the focus of the search warrant is on documents that Trump removed from the White House, including some 15 boxes of materials that have now been recovered. These materials reportedly included classified documents. There are serious penalties, including criminal ones, for removing, damaging or destroying any official government document. The law treats a mishandling of classified documents even more severely. But even in the case of nonclassified documents, the penalties for mishandling can include disqualification from holding future federal office (although that would be a protracted process and Trump might challenge it on multiple grounds, including arguing that it impermissibly varies the constitutional qualifications for the presidency). As former prosecutors and defense attorneys, we know that, to conduct this court-ordered search, the government would have had to go through a demanding process of establishing probable cause that an offense had occurred. The search warrant materials would have had to be approved at multiple senior levels of the FBI and DOJ. Given the profile of the target, we have little doubt that Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco and likely Attorney General Merrick Garland would have been briefed. But that is not the end of the process. A district court judge or federal magistrate had to independently review the supporting affidavit and make a finding of probable cause to believe that evidence, fruits or instrumentalities of a crime would be found on Trump\u2019s premises. While the reported basis of the search warrant related to the removal or mishandling of official documents, that does not mean that those potential offenses are the only ones that prosecutors are looking at. Nor does it mean that investigators must ignore any other evidence they might happen across that would bear upon other crimes. If they follow the terms of the search warrant and lawfully discover evidence, fruits or instrumentalities of other crimes on the premises, they may also seize and use those materials in prosecutions. Why Trump didn't want to lift a finger on January 6 Members of the House Select Committee investigating the January 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection have said they believe that the evidence they have accumulated could be grounds for criminal investigation of Trump. Committee vice-chair Liz Cheney said in a recent interview with CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt that if the Justice Department does not prosecute Trump for the part he played in the insurrection and \u201cthe facts and the evidence are there,\u201d the decision could call into question our ability to \u201ccall ourselves a nation of laws.\u201d The committee has made much of that evidence public in its eight hearings. In March, even before the mountain of new evidence disclosed by those hearings, a federal judge said it was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that Trump attempted to obstruct the certification by Congress of Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 presidential election, also suggesting that the former president had committed the offense of conspiring to defraud the United States by seeking to block the electors of the lawfully chosen president and substitute his own fraudulent ones. In fact, even before Monday\u2019s seizure of the documents, Trump\u2019s lawyers were in communication with DOJ officials, according to CNN sources, to discuss assertions of executive privilege. That seems unlikely to relate only (if at all) to Trump\u2019s mishandling or removal of official documents. Instead, it signals a sharp interest in issues like the false electoral slates that give rise to the likely crimes of conspiracy to defraud and obstruction of congress. The January 6 committee is methodically building the case for a criminal conspiracy Garland has come in for criticism by some who compared his pace unfavorably to that of other investigators. The select committee has sped ahead with its presentation of possible crimes and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has marched forward briskly as well, convening a grand jury and issuing at least 16 target letters to false electors. With the events at Mar-a-Lago, the AG is now clearly moving aggressively. He is doing so at full speed and with the powerful, nationwide investigative tools of the DOJ, that neither a congressional committee nor a local district attorney have at their ready disposal. As Garland recently said, federal prosecutors are now engaged in the \u201cmost wide-ranging investigation and the most important investigation that the Justice Department has ever entered into\u2026We have to get this right.\u201d  He clearly means it. If some thought he was moving slower than they would have liked, he\u2019s now clearly moving faster than we all expected. If you believe that no one is above the law, and that the powerful and the powerless should be treated the same in the face of probable cause of crime, the new pace of Garland\u2019s investigation is profoundly reassuring.",

He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Dennis Aftergut is a former federal prosecutor and is currently of counsel to Lawyers Defending American Democracy. The views in this commentary belong to the authors. View more opinion at CNN. The conviction of former Trump adviser Steve Bannon for contempt of Congress marks an important moment \u2013 not only in holding him individually accountable, but also in bringing to justice those who plotted to undermine the results of the 2020 presidential election. This is the first trial involving a member of former President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle at the time of the former president\u2019s assault on the 2020 election results. And, on Friday, our legal system called Bannon\u2019s bluff after he defied a subpoena to appear before the January 6 House select committee. Even though Bannon\u2019s conviction is for contempt, rather than for an underlying crime, the principle remains the same. For more than two centuries, America has been a society bound by the rule of law, not the rule of men \u2013 and we need to keep it that way. Bannon\u2019s case was weak from the start. Opening his criminal trial, prosecutor Amanda Vaughn told the jury, \u201cThis case is about the defendant thumbing his nose at the orderly process of our government.\u201d Referring to Bannon\u2019s failure to appear before the January 6 committee, she explained: \u201cThe defendant didn\u2019t get the date wrong. He didn\u2019t get confused on where to go. He didn\u2019t get stuck on a broken down metro car. He just refused to follow the rules.\u201d The select committee\u2019s chief counsel, Kristin Amerling, then testified to the \u201curgency\u201d of getting to the truth before the current Congress\u2019 term expires in January 2023. She explained that the committee wanted to hear from Bannon, among other things, about \u201cdiscussions leading up to the Jan. 6 attack with private parties who had gathered in the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, reportedly to discuss strategies in efforts to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power or overturn the election results.\u201d Her lengthy testimony made clear Bannon had a duty to comply, that his testimony was pertinent and that he violated the subpoena deliberately. That was enough for a conviction. Opinion: Steve Bannon's new ploy The defense raised two issues at the beginning of the trial to try to justify Bannon\u2019s lack of compliance. First, they claimed that Bannon was still negotiating with the committee after his failure to produce subpoenaed documents and to appear, and before Congress held him in contempt. But the evidence showed that he never asked the committee to move the deadline for his appearance. And the day after his subpoena deadline passed, his verified Gettr account posted: \u201cSteve Bannon tells the Jan 6 select committee that he will NOT comply with their subpoena.\u201d Second, the defense has referred to Bannon\u2019s July 9 letter indicating, eight months after he failed to appear and just days before his trial, his willingness to cooperate. The law is settled  that tardy compliance with a subpoena cannot block a prosecution once it has commenced. After all, the primary aim of a criminal contempt action is to punish someone who disobeyed a subpoena regardless of whether he tries later to comply. Despite the defense\u2019s opening statements, Bannon\u2019s legal team did not present an actual defense when the prosecutor finished presenting. Bannon\u2019s eye was evidently not on a jury acquittal but on an appeal, after conviction, of federal district court Judge Carl Nichols\u2019 pre-trial rulings. Good luck with that appeal. Steve Bannon rails against January 6 committee chairman Nichols, a Trump appointee, was on solid ground in rejecting Bannon\u2019s claim of executive privilege. Bannon had long since left the White House when the post-2020 election events occurred and should not have been protected by such privilege. Nichols also rightly rejected his non-viable defense that his lawyer advised him he could defy the committee, as well as his claims that the committee\u2019s subpoena was invalid and that internal Justice Department policies protected him. All of this led Bannon\u2019s lawyer to ask the court, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of going to trial if there are no defenses?\u201d To which Nichols pithily replied, \u201cAgreed.\u201d When a defendant goes to trial despite the overwhelming proof of his guilt, prosecutors say the trial is little more than \u201ca long guilty plea.\u201d Take note, Peter Navarro, former Trump ally and White House trade adviser who was also indicted for the same defiance. On July 15, he rejected a generous Justice Department plea deal. Also take note, Trump, to whom both the committee and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis may issue a subpoena. Willis\u2019 grand jury is investigating Trump and his allies\u2019 alleged attempt to interfere in Georgia\u2019s 2020 election. There is a simple reason why neither a legitimate congressional investigative committee nor a grand jury can tolerate this kind of defiance. If they did, subpoenaed witnesses with something to hide would never cooperate, and no investigation would ever uncover the truth.  Here\u2019s an even more fundamental point. Subpoena defiance and the insurrection are birds of a feather. The American system of government requires that there be both a peaceful transition of power and a successful investigation of those who seek to interfere with it. Deterrence by punishment for such interference is the only way to stabilize American democracy. Bannon has used his defiance as an opportunity to bolster his MAGA brand \u2013 with more of his usual bravado. That, however, will not shield him from the consequences in a federal court where the judge has seen through his ploys. Bannon now faces a minimum of 30 days and up to one year in jail on each of the two counts. In November, after being arraigned, Bannon said this trial would be \u201cthe misdemeanor from hell\u201d for the Biden administration. Nichols and the jury made sure that did not happen \u2013 except perhaps to Bannon himself. In a society governed by the rule of law, there is a piper to be paid.",

Fred Wertheimer is president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan, non-profit organization that works to strengthen US democracy. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. Read more opinion articles on CNN. The resignation of two Manhattan prosecutors for their boss\u2019s failure to charge former President Donald Trump over potential financial crimes last month has reignited debate over whether he will ever be held accountable for his alleged misdeeds. That matters not only looking back but also going forward because perhaps his most notorious outrage \u2013 the big lie that he won the 2020 presidential election \u2013 has not halted. It continues to drive hundreds of voter suppression and election sabotage bills and anti-democratic candidates across the country. And it has captured and corrupted a significant faction of the Republican Party. Thankfully, Judge David Carter\u2019s decision on Monday, finding Trump \u201cmore likely than not\u201d committed crimes, sets out a road map for finally imposing consequences for the big lie. It does so by tackling the thorniest legal issues regarding Trump, his enablers and the events in and around January 6, 2021 \u2013 and showing how they can be addressed by prosecutors. Perhaps the most daunting of these is the question of Trump\u2019s criminal intent. How can a prosecutor prove what Trump was thinking when he publicly claims good faith but refuses to testify, when those closest to him also resist or are hostile witnesses and when he does not use the prosecutor\u2019s best friend, email? Intent is where the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s financial case seemed to come a cropper. Whatever you think of the DA\u2019s failure to prosecute financial crime, and we strongly disagreed, Carter offered a powerful array of evidence about democracy crimes. Carter applies precedent to show that \u201ca person does not need to know their actions are wrong to break the law.\u201d Trump exceeded this threshold because he likely knew that right-wing lawyer John Eastman\u2019s plan to throw out electoral votes was illegal. Carter cites the January 6 House select committee\u2019s carefully compiled evidence that Trump was advised publicly and privately numerous times that there was absolutely no evidence of significant electoral fraud. As the opinion notes, Trump\u2019s calls to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which he famously asked the secretary to \u201cgive (him) a break\u201d and \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d (one vote more than Biden\u2019s margin of victory in that state) reveal the former President\u2019s goal: not to undertake any legitimate investigation, but simply to overturn the election. This is strong evidence of a \u201ccorrupt mindset,\u201d and it leads Carter to an eminently simple conclusion: \u201c(t)he illegality of the plan was obvious.\u201d Why it's so hard to prosecute Donald Trump By marshaling both private conversations and public writings about the plan to overturn the election\u2019s lack of evidentiary basis, Carter shows that prosecutors have at their disposal a wide array of forms of evidence probative of the former President\u2019s intent. Perhaps no one on earth has developed a lengthier evidentiary record than Trump \u2013 and prosecutors can unlock that record to hold him accountable. This effectively contradicts those who say intent will be hard to prove and is a useful signpost for the upcoming January 6 committee hearings and report \u2013 and for when the Justice Department receives the committee\u2019s full evidence and any criminal referrals. The judge\u2019s analysis does not stop only at tackling the knotty issue of intent. He goes on to tackle the charge of obstruction of an official proceeding in Congress. This can be hard to prove (having worked on this issue during Trump\u2019s first impeachment, one of us knows this particularly well). But the judge\u2019s opinion shows the way. Carter joins other federal judges in ruling that the congressional electoral count is an \u201cofficial proceeding,\u201d and he rules that Trump likely attempted to obstruct or impede that official proceeding under Title 18 Section 1512 of the US Code. By synthesizing evidence from Twitter, the President\u2019s private schedule, remarks at the Ellipse rally and other sources, Carter traces Eastman and Trump\u2019s activity in the days leading up to January 6 and finds that these actions \u201cmore likely than not\u201d constitute obstruction. The judge also mapped another important possible crime: conspiracy to defraud the US under Title 18 Section 371. He did so as to Eastman and Trump, but in terms that by implication could apply broadly to many others in their circle. Here, the opinion notes that \u201c(l)eading small meetings in the heart of the White House implies an agreement between the President and Dr. Eastman and a shared goal of advancing the electoral count plan.\u201d 'Scary': John King reacts to memo from Trump lawyer (2021) The possible implications for the rest of Trump\u2019s enablers are obvious. Eastman is certainly not the only person alleged to have participated in calls or meetings relating to overturning the election. Tremors must have gone down the spines of former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and many more who were allegedly part of such conversations. It is also worth noting that the judge ultimately ordered disclosure of only one document based on the \u201ccrime-fraud\u201d exception to attorney-client privilege. That one document, however, is significant. It is an email chain that forwarded to Eastman a draft memo written for Giuliani. Carter notes that \u201cthis may have been the first time members of President Trump\u2019s team transformed a legal interpretation \u2026 into a day-by-day plan of action.\u201d By recognizing that Eastman\u2019s theories weren\u2019t just legal musings but the action plan for \u201ca coup in search of a legal theory,\u201d Carter knocks down one of the key phony arguments on which Eastman and Trump have relied. This is obviously helpful to the committee in framing their hearings around this illicit conduct and in including strong criminal referrals to the Justice Department in its report. Because there is likely more evidence than what has already been disclosed, the committee should build on the judge\u2019s opinion, and then it is for the Justice Department to evaluate and determine whether the cases can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, neither we nor the committee should neglect the importance of all this to state prosecutors like Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis in Georgia, who is investigating Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to overturn the election in that state. She must grapple with these issues of proving criminal intent, conspiracy and the like under Georgia law. And Willis has added a Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) expert to her team to advise in her investigation. The judge has made all that easier for her, and the committee should also keep her investigation in mind as they build on his work in their hearings and in their report. (They are reportedly already talking to her office, which is a promising sign.)  Of course, some caveats do apply. The California federal case was a civil proceeding, and so involved a lower standard of proof than the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard that will apply in a federal or state criminal case. Moreover, Eastman will undoubtedly appeal, which might delay matters. But his efforts are unlikely to be successful owing to the judge\u2019s very searching review of the record. Indeed, there is only one part of his opinion to which we take exception. At the close, Carter writes that \u201c(m)ore than a year after the attack on our Capitol, the public is still searching for accountability. This case cannot provide it.\u201d That is false modesty. He might have said, \u201ccannot directly provide it.\u201d Carter knows the limited implications of his decision. But he has expertly tackled the key legal issues that the public needs to understand, and that will need to be addressed by the January 6 committee in making any criminal referrals and ultimately by federal and state prosecutors in their own efforts to hold Trump accountable. Hopefully, all will use the road map the judge has provided and do something about the underlying offenses. That matters for the sake of holding Trump and his enablers accountable, for stopping the ongoing big lie crime spree of the MAGA faction of the GOP and for protecting our democracy itself.",

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. \u201cAttorney General Garland, do your job \u2013 so that we can do ours,\u201d declared an exasperated Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia on Monday night as part of her work as a member of the January 6 House select committee. Luria and others on the committee expressed frustration with Merrick Garland and the Department of Justice still not acting on the December 14, 2021, vote by the House recommending criminal charges against former Donald Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows for defying a congressional subpoena. But the frustration many have with Garland goes far beyond simply the over three-month silence on Meadows. As I hear frequently from listeners to my SiriusXM show, the fact that we don\u2019t hear a peep about Garland investigating Trump for his attempted coup to overturn the 2020 election and potential crimes in connection with the January 6 attack on the Capitol is beyond frustrating. And those voices demanding Garland to act will be growing louder given a federal court decision Monday where the judge wrote that it was \u201cmore likely than not that\u201d Trump committed crimes given his efforts to prevent the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s victory. While the focus of this case was a request by Trump\u2019s former lawyer John Eastman to withhold certain documents requested by the January 6 committee based on claims they are protected by attorney-client privilege, US District Court Judge David Carter laid out a damning case against Trump for his conduct surrounding January 6 \u2013 including potential crime. As the judge wrote, Trump and his lawyer had \u201claunched a campaign to overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history,\u201d adding, \u201cit was a coup in search of a legal theory.\u201d And in a bone-chilling passage, the judge explained that if Trump and Eastman\u2019s \u201cplan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution.\u201d Judge Carter reminded us that Trump had been informed by people in his inner circle, including his then-Attorney General William Barr, that there was no evidence of election fraud. Yet, Trump continued his unjustified efforts to overturn the election results by pressuring Vice President Mike Pence to not allow Congress to certify the election results on January 6. The court then, while addressing what is known as the \u201ccrime-fraud exception\u201d to attorney-client privilege, analyzed two federal crimes that the January 6 committee alleges Trump may have committed: \u201cObstruction of an official proceeding\u201d and \u201cConspiracy to defraud the United States.\u201d After a detailed recitation of Trump and Eastman\u2019s conduct as applied to these federal crimes, the judge bluntly concluded: \u201cThe illegality of the plan was obvious.\u201d Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich responded to the judge\u2019s ruling stating \u201cThis absurd and baseless ruling by a Clinton-appointed Judge in California is just another example of how the left is weaponizing every branch of government against President Trump.\u201d Eastman\u2019s lawyer stated his client \u201crespectfully disagrees with the judge\u2019s findings\u201d but will comply with the order. What the January 6 report means for the future of democracy Yes, it\u2019s obvious to all of us that what Trump did was wrong \u2013 and potentially illegal \u2013 which begs the question: Where is Garland\u2019s DOJ investigation into Trump? Could there be a super secret investigation of Trump? Sure, but common sense says we would have heard something, the same way we hear about the testimony of witnesses after they appear before the House select committee on January 6. Lawyers talk, court clerks see witnesses showing up for a grand jury, etc. All you need is one person to talk to break a story. Add to that, history tells us that the longer a DOJ investigation continues, the more likely there will be leaks to the media. On Wednesday, CNN reported that the Justice Department investigation into the business activities of the President\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, \u201chas gained steam in recent months, with a flurry of witnesses providing testimony to federal investigators and more expected to provide interviews in the coming weeks, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\u201d Investigators are looking into the younger Biden\u2019s business dealings internationally during Biden\u2019s term as vice president. Hunter Biden has denied wrongdoing and his father is not being investigated as part of this probe, CNN reported, citing sources. The DOJ\u2019s investigation, which began in 2018, became known in December 2020 when Hunter Biden revealed it. And, of course, when the DOJ investigated Hillary Clinton in connection with her emails, the nation first learned about it in August 2015, based on information from two unnamed government officials. While the DOJ refused to comment on the investigation, the media were filled with stories of developments in the investigation \u2013 via leaks \u2013 such as in March 2016 when the DOJ granted immunity to a former Clinton staffer. Clinton eventually was cleared in the investigation. When it comes to Trump, however, we hear nothing. Garland recently said that he was intent on ensuring the DOJ\u2019s decisions about prosecutions \u201care made on the merits \u2026 the facts and the law,\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re not based on any kind of partisan considerations.\u201d I couldn\u2019t agree more. If there\u2019s credible evidence that Hunter Biden \u2013 or anyone for that matter, Democrat or Republican \u2013 may have committed a federal crime, there should be a DOJ investigation. Yet the sense many have is that this DOJ has no problem investigating people named Biden and Clinton but we have seen no signs of investigating Trump despite Garland\u2019s promise in January that \u201cThe Justice Department remains committed to holding all January 6th perpetrators, at any level, accountable under law.\u201d And the longer that apparent double standard continues, the more Americans will question if in fact \u201cpartisan considerations\u201d are driving the DOJ\u2019s decisions when it comes to Trump.  Judge Carter concluded his opinion with a sentiment I\u2019m sure many agree with, \u201cMore than a year after the attack on our Capitol, the public is still searching for accountability.\u201d He then added ominously, \u201cIf the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.\u201d You don\u2019t need a law degree to understand that if Trump is not held accountable for both his attempted coup and the January 6 attack, why would Trump \u2013 or any future president for that matter \u2013 think that they can\u2019t do the same? The stakes are too high for timidity given our democratic Republic hangs in the balance. The demand must be made by all who seek to preserve it is this: \u201cAttorney General Garland, do your job.\u201d",

View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta\u201d on weekends. The House select committee on January 6 has, thus far, done a remarkable job exposing the truth behind the Capitol insurrection. Through its dogged investigative work, the committee has uncovered damning testimony and documents proving that the effort to steal the 2020 election was premeditated and deliberate, and that former President Donald Trump stood at the epicenter of it all. But the committee also has plenty of unfinished business. Time and again, it has made splashy announcements about its subpoenas or requests for testimony aimed at well-placed, high-profile subjects. With the exception of Steve Bannon, who was held in contempt and indicted, many of those people have casually brushed off the committee, which has, thus far, done nothing publicly in response. Over the next few weeks, we\u2019ll see whether the committee intends to pursue these powerful individuals for their testimony, or whether they will quietly slink away and hope nobody notices. The committee has issued subpoenas to Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, Trump\u2019s former attorneys who spewed lies about election fraud and devised plans to interfere with the proper counting of electoral votes by Congress on January 6. These members of the self-titled legal \u201cElite Strike Force,\u201d who also routinely got thrashed in the courts, have responded to the committee\u2019s subpoenas with a combination of silence and defiance. (A lawyer for Giuliani called the subpoena \u201cpolitical theater\u201d and said Giuliani would be covered by executive privilege; beyond a joking tweet, it seems Ellis hasn\u2019t publicly responded. Powell\u2019s attorney, meanwhile, said that she would appear before the House Select Committee.) While the committee has held other witnesses who refused to testify in contempt \u2013 Bannon now faces criminal prosecution for contempt of Congress, for which he\u2019s pleaded not guilty, and the DOJ continues to consider whether to charge former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 it has made no countermove yet toward Giuliani or the other lawyers. Biden's promise to appoint a Black woman as Supreme Court justice updates an old tradition Ivanka Trump received an official request from the committee to testify as well. In a non-responsive statement, her spokesperson shrugged that the committee already knows she did not speak at the January 6 rally and implied she had nothing much to offer beyond her public statement that day anyway. The former President whined that the committee will \u201cgo after children;\u201d Ivanka Trump is 40 years old and served as senior adviser to the President. The committee has done nothing in response to compel her testimony. It hasn\u2019t even upped the ante to a formal subpoena. And then there\u2019s the matter of the committee members\u2019 own colleagues in Congress. The committee believes Reps. Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan and Scott Perry all have vital information about the January 6 attack. All three were involved in spreading the big lie of the election fraud before January 6 and McCarthy and Jordan were in direct contact with Trump on that fateful day. Yet all three congressmen have angrily denied the committee information. McCarthy called the committee\u2019s investigation \u201cillegitimate;\u201d Jordan said he has \u201cno relevant information;\u201d and Perry declined the committee\u2019s request. The committee has remained silent about what, if anything, it will do next.  Whatever happened to Jeffrey Clark, the former DOJ official who tried to push Trump\u2019s election fraud lie from inside the Justice Department? The committee moved to hold him in contempt last year after he appeared for an interview but refused to answer certain questions or hand over documents. (Clark\u2019s attorney provided the panel with a 12-page letter refusing nearly every question on the grounds that Trump was entitled to confidential legal advice.)  But the committee decided to give him a second chance to appear for an interview before sending the contempt matter to the full House for a vote. Clark\u2019s second interview was then postponed because of medical issues and now nearly two months later: nothing. In all of these instances, the committee faces a stark choice: Play hardball or give up. If it\u2019s truly committed to learning the full truth, it will subpoena each target, hold those who continue to stonewall in contempt and send them to the Justice Department for potential prosecution. Time is a key factor here. Committee members have said they intend to hold public hearings in early 2022 and issue at least a draft report by around midyear. And if Republicans take control of the House after the upcoming midterms, the committee\u2019s work likely will come to an end. It would take some time for the committee to pursue these recalcitrant subjects in Congress and potentially in the courts \u2013 and the clock is ticking.  But the committee has done no such thing yet, for the vast majority of the people discussed above.  Perhaps it has calculated that (despite its own fiery rhetoric when it initially sought testimony from these key players) it\u2019s simply not worth costly legal and political battles to compel their testimony or to impose punishment. But if the committee fails to follow up its words with meaningful action, then it will show that, at least when it comes pursuing truth from powerful, well-connected people, it\u2019s more bark than bite.",

He is a CNN political commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. To watch a local Philadelphia evening news broadcast a few days before Christmas was a thoroughly depressing experience \u2014 there was the carjacking of a US congresswoman at gunpoint in south Philadelphia, a dangerous high-speed chase through narrow city streets and a police officer who was shot twice in the shoulder while responding to a robbery. With two 20-something children and a niece living in Philadelphia, I closely monitor the latest developments. The fear is palpable, and many residents are much more alert to the lurking dangers throughout the city. During the last six weeks of 2021, my son, who is a student at Temple University, was shaken down for money by three robbers at a north Philly gas station. My daughter, a fourth-year medical student at Thomas Jefferson University who spends a significant amount of time working at medical clinics serving indigent residents, was assaulted by a deranged woman within the shadow of City Hall. My niece, a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, lives in a West Philly neighborhood where there have been numerous carjackings. And that\u2019s just my family. Thankfully, all three are fine and going about their studies. The same cannot be said of the 559 murder victims in Philadelphia last year. That\u2019s the most recorded murders in the city since it started keeping records in the 1960s. One such murder was of my son\u2019s fellow Temple classmate, Samuel Sean Collington, who was shot during an attempted carjacking after the Thanksgiving break. The suspect is a 17-year-old who was arrested and charged in August in connection with violent crime including armed robbery. He was released when the victim failed to appear for a pretrial hearing. Philadelphia had more murders in 2021 than New York City \u2013 a city over five times larger than the City of Brotherly Love. One would think such a sobering, horrifying reality would cause local elected officials to respond forcefully to a carnage of this magnitude. Instead, liberal Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner responded in December, saying while gun violence had risen, other violent crime had not \u2013 or to quote him directly: \u201cWe don\u2019t have a crisis of lawlessness. We don\u2019t have a crisis of crime. We don\u2019t have a crisis of violence.\u201d America's crime wave tests both parties And though Krasner later said that \u201cmessage conveyed through media sound bites is not at all what I meant\u201d and that he did not mean to diminish the pain of the families who had been victims of gun violence, it was too late. He had offended virtually everyone who possesses functional eyes and ears. One such person so appalled by this monumentally tone-deaf statement was former Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter, an effective Democratic leader with a strong record on public safety who presided over the city during a period of relative prosperity. In a scathing op-ed, Nutter excoriated Krasner with lines like these: \u201caudacity of ignorance and white privilege\u2026I have to wonder what kind of messed up world of White wokeness Krasner is living in to have so little regard for human lives lost, many of them Black and brown, while he advances his own national profile as a progressive district attorney.\u201d  Nutter added, \u201che [Krasner] has ignored the pain of the living and insulted the memory of the dead.\u201d The Nutter-Krasner battle reflects a growing rift within the Democratic Party over public safety.  A vocal element within the Democratic Party that advocated for defunding the police in 2020 has run into resistance from sensible Democrats who reject Krasner and other DAs of his ilk around the country. It\u2019s about time. With Democrats in a defensive position for the upcoming congressional 2022 midterm election, crime and urban lawlessness will be used as a wedge issue by the GOP against them, just as they did with success in 2020. 19-year-old charged in armed carjacking incident involving Democratic lawmaker To be fair, homicide rates have surged nationally, including in areas where Republicans have governing responsibilities. Further, the January 6 insurrection \u2013 and the Republicans who have attempted to whitewash what happened on that terrible day \u2013 has tarnished the GOP\u2019s image as the tough on crime party of law enforcement. Nevertheless, Democrats will remain more vulnerable on the issue given their overwhelming control of big cities throughout the country where liberal district attorneys and social justice Democrats have an outsized voice and influence. The bottom line is that elected officials in major urban centers must address the homicide wave occurring on their watch. Indulging those extreme voices who argue for defunding the police and making law enforcement out as villains must end. It\u2019s time to get serious about what is happening on the streets. Democratic mayors, councilmen and district attorneys have the power to course correct if they have the courage and political will to do so. If they don\u2019t, Democrats will pay a price at the polls across the country as voters, who too often see horrifying local news segments full of upsetting criminal activity, will reject the party they believe bears responsibility for the decline in public safety. 2021 was a deadly year for police officers in the US Politicians who can speak effectively to the menacing crime problem will do so by advancing public safety measures to refund the police, end no cash bail, raise penalties for smash and grab robberies, deploy more police in high crime areas, reinstate community policing, expand crime victim services and enforce quality of life crimes. Above all, the mission of law enforcement and the men and women who serve must be supported by local elected officials. In too many communities across America, police officers don\u2019t believe they have, or can count on, support from their elected leaders, which is damaging morale and depleting police forces. And this is only compounded by police forces facing backlogs, as they struggle to solve the number of open cases they currently have on their dockets. The political costs of a rise in violent crime, like homicide, will be born most heavily by House Democrats in competitive districts. Rep. Abigail Spanberger told her House Democratic colleagues shortly after the 2020 midterm election in which she narrowly won re-election that \u201cdefund the police\u201d rhetoric nearly cost her the Virginia seat she holds.  What\u2019s worse than the political costs are the impacts on the lives of our fellow citizens who fear for their safety in their homes and neighborhoods. Crime drives residents who can afford to leave their homes, leaving behind more vulnerable people with more limited incomes. Poverty becomes more pervasive as disinvestment saps the strength of those left behind. To get a real feel for the plight of people impacted by violent crime, attend a neighborhood crime watch or civic association meeting where elderly homeowners will provide an unvarnished assessment of conditions on the street. Trust me, they won\u2019t hold back. It\u2019s long past time to hear these good people out, address their concerns and help them reclaim their neighborhoods. They deserve to live free from fear and rightfully expect their government to help.",

While there has been progress toward accountability \u2013 among other things, we at the States United Democracy Center recently filed a lawsuit on behalf of the District of Columbia against the Proud Boys and other conspirators who invaded the Capitol \u2013 overall our democracy may be even more vulnerable than last year. Watergate journalist: January 6th commission is at a great disadvantage That\u2019s why the January 6 House Select Committee is right to plan bipartisan hearings and an interim report release by this summer. The sooner that happens, the better \u2013 and the less bogged down it will be in midterm politics. That\u2019s not to say the pace of the investigation has been lacking. Those who have been critical of Congress on that front neglect the reality of good investigations \u2013 that they are shaped like a pyramid. At the bottom, investigators gather vast amounts of information through tactics ranging from informal interviews to on-the-record depositions to document subpoenas. Next, all that information is narrowed and focused through hearings, where key facts are winnowed down, and hypotheses are tested. Finally, the investigators issue a report or reports, laying out a clear fact-based narrative and presenting conclusions and proposals for fixes. We are now substantially through the first phase of the committee\u2019s thorough investigation. The committee has received thousands of documents and interviewed more than 300 witnesses. We know more about the terrible events leading up to January 6, including the January 5 \u201cwar room\u201d at the Willard Hotel, where Trump loyalists like Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani planned to overturn the legitimate election outcome. We know more about the Trump campaign\u2019s extensive outreach to state representatives asking them to appoint phony slates of \u201calternate\u201d electors. We know that, on January 6, the defeated president and his team watched the violence and chaos at the Capitol for more than three hours, fielding desperate requests for help, without former President Donald Trump speaking out. The question the GOP must answer about January 6 When witnesses have refused to cooperate in that first fact-gathering phase, Congress has pushed back hard, referring Bannon and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows to the Department of Justice for their flagrantly contemptuous refusal to cooperate. After surrendering on contempt charges, Bannon likened the charges to a witch hunt; Meadows, on the other hand, has claimed that executive privilege shields him from testifying.  And when Trump interposed a meritless executive privilege argument in an attempt to hide his administration\u2019s records, the committee litigated fiercely and quickly \u2013 winning at the district court and appellate levels in just three months, and now asking for an expedited decision at the Supreme Court. As the committee\u2019s investigation moves into its next major chapter, those Trump administration documents will be needed for hearings, which we can logically expect to begin as soon as the first quarter of this year if a report is to be issued by summer. The hearings will be critically important for sharpening the committee\u2019s own investigation, and for focusing the country\u2019s attention on the truth. We\u2019ve seen that many times before \u2013 from Watergate hearings, to Iran-Contra, to the first Trump impeachment. Then will come the third phase: the reports. The interim report is planned to follow early this summer, with a final one to follow later. The committee\u2019s timing reflects the reality that the closer we get to the November midterms, the more politicized will be the perception of their every act. The bipartisanship of the committee\u2019s operations is critical for the legitimacy of their work, and they likely recognize that issuing a report before the kickoff of the fall campaign season will continue that record. Above all, we need to know more about why Trump failed to quell the insurrection for so long after the Capitol was breached. The report\u2019s fact-finding on that and many other issues will be critical to helping the American people understand the truth about January 6 and to help leaders at all levels of government take action to prevent another insurrection. While just over a majority of Republicans in a recent CBS poll said that the criminal invasion of the Capitol was appropriately characterized as \u201cdefending freedom,\u201d there is an opening for the truth: According to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, 62% of Americans, and even 29% of Republicans, believe the investigation is appropriate. Bipartisan leaders in Congress, and the state and local officials who oversee our elections, have been fighting the \u201cBig Lie\u201d for more than a year. They are demanding action from all levels of government, and timely interim truth-telling can help. But the committee must not stop there. Once it finds the facts, it should consider their significance in light of the law. Part of that is looking forward and recommending new legislation to prevent anything like January 6 from ever occurring again. And the other equally important part is looking back and making criminal referrals to federal and state prosecutors if the evidence supports it. There\u2019s a long and bipartisan history of such referrals. The committee\u2019s interim report should detail all potential violations and ask prosecutors to investigate. After all, the potential for prosecution is also an important part of accountability. We disagree with people who \u2013 in the name of the appearance of nonpartisanship \u2013 urge Congress to stay away from criminal referrals. Congress was one of the victims of the January 6 attack, and like any victim it has the prerogative \u2013 and, here, the responsibility \u2013 to tell law enforcement what happened. January 6 was a test the US keeps failing There\u2019s plenty of reason to believe that plotters against our democracy may have violated federal law. Among other applicable provisions, Committee Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, has pointed to 18 USC 1512, which prohibits conspiracies to \u201ccorruptly\u2026 obstruct\u201d official proceedings. And a (Trump-appointed) federal judge has already held that Congress\u2019 January 6 electoral votes count was indeed an official proceeding under the statute. Local and state prosecutors also may be looking to the January 6 report for insight into the plotters\u2019 various efforts to disrupt and steal elections. Fani Willis, the district attorney in Georgia\u2019s Fulton County, has announced an investigation into Trump\u2019s alleged attempt to interfere with the election in Georgia \u2013 including his call asking Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to just \u201cfind 11,780 votes\u201d that did not exist to swing the state. The committee\u2019s investigation may well provide Willis with more information on Trump and his associates \u2013 and, in fact, we know that Fulton prosecutors are already communicating with committee staff. Trump denies all wrongdoing. Nor is Georgia necessarily the only state where Trump and his allies sought to improperly influence election officials and obstruct vote-counting. For instance: In November of 2020, Trump summoned Michigan legislators to the White House in an attempt to convince them to override Biden\u2019s approximately 154,000 vote win in the state. The committee may have evidence about that remarkably brazen overreach \u2013 or evidence of soliciting election fraud in other states. Once the interim report is out, any referrals will be in the hands of federal, state and local prosecutors. A referral isn\u2019t a command, of course \u2013 prosecutors must still conduct independent investigations and make their own determinations about whether to prosecute. For careful prosecutors, like US Attorney General Merrick Garland, that independent investigation takes time, which is why referrals should be made sooner rather than later.  We understand the impatience with Garland in some quarters, but his deliberate approach makes sense. He has lowered the political temperature at the Justice Department and restored order. He is investigating hot-button issues with care \u2013 letting the committee do its work, and then picking up the threads and following where they lead. We are confident that he will take any referrals seriously, and we think his handling of the Bannon case proves it. Bannon was indicted for contempt of Congress in November. One year out from January 6, we are finally approaching clarity about what Trump and his allies were willing to do to steal an election. But we need more information and more accountability. The interim report can\u2019t come soon enough.",

            "article_content": "Americans are used to voters being angry at Congress and the president, but there\u2019s a new vein of anger directed at local officials and a nationwide coordination in campaigns to recall or intimidate county supervisors and school board members. With the unapologetic use of threats of violence to influence local officials, it signals a more confrontational local politics, and it may be driving local officials \u2013 the people who make cities, towns and counties run \u2013 from the profession of civil service. CNN\u2019s Kyung Lah, a national reporter based in Los Angeles, has encountered the anger in her reporting from around the country. She has put together a new documentary, \u201cPerilous Politics: America\u2019s Dangerous Divide,\u201d that looks at how anger and confrontation are infiltrating main street America. I talked to Lah about what she and her documentary producers found. Our conversation is below. WOLF: What\u2019s behind this documentary? What led you to start reporting this out, and what did you find? LAH: As a field reporter, I was seeing the type of rage at the local level that has usually been aimed at the federal level, the national level \u2013 anger over how Congress is working, or that the federal government is coming to take your guns. Now what we\u2019re seeing is the wheels of democracy that are most intimately aligned with your average person \u2013 your school, your city and your local election \u2013 all of that becoming the focus of extremism and extreme anger. The hostility that you would see normally reserved for somebody up on high is now in your backyard. That\u2019s really what was the driving force behind it. WOLF: You go from Shasta County, California, to Loudoun County, Virginia, to an election office in Colorado. Is there something that ties these very different places together? LAH: The people we meet are the invisible workers of democracy. The small wheels of democracy that make America function are the people you get your permit from to host an event, to open your business in your community, to vote in your city council election. And they\u2019re also faceless. These are not people who got into government because they want to be in a commercial that\u2019s played nationally or seeking the Oval Office. They got into government because they want to make their community function. And what we\u2019re seeing is with the same rage \u2013 that ugliness in the national level against those spokes of democracy \u2013 jamming in the small spokes of democracy. It is having a significant impact on how our communities function. WOLF: A lot of these threats that you document were inspired by Covid-19 \u2013 either business restrictions or school restrictions. Have they dissipated with the end of the pandemic? LAH: No, they\u2019ve changed. For example, in Loudoun County, first it was masks, and then it became CRT, this large bucket item of CRT fueled by conservative media. (CRT is the acronym for critical race theory, which many on the right fear is infiltrating schools.) And then it became transgender rights. I\u2019m talking about Loudoun, but this is happening nationwide. We stop in these communities in Shasta, in Nevada County, in Madison, in Detroit. It\u2019s happening everywhere. I hope our viewers walk away with this understanding that while we\u2019ve stopped in these communities, it is a problem that is ubiquitous in American society right now. WOLF: One of the things I found most interesting is that you talk to people who were unapologetic about threatening violence. Do they see this as a legitimate form of political pressure? LAH: They do. How was it that Carlos put it to me \u2013 that righteous anger has a place in civil society. (Carlos Zapata is featured in Lah\u2019s documentary. He led an effort to recall Board of Supervisors members in Shasta County, California, and is the founder of Red, White & Blueprint, which encourages confrontational politics elsewhere in the country.) LAH: I think it\u2019s far too simplistic to say that the coarseness we see on social media is now spilling out in other ways. But I think that is a large part of it. We\u2019ve become so hostile to one another and that seems to move the needle on social media, that seems to move the needle on mass media. They think that\u2019s going to change things at the local level. WOLF: A lot of this seems to be about intimidation. If you can\u2019t beat someone at the ballot box or in an election, make them afraid, make them uninterested in running for office. How are the targeted office holders dealing with this kind of rhetoric? LAH: They\u2019re leaving. I think that that is very clear. Just take a look at how many people have retired from election work. How are we going to conduct the business of American democracy \u2013 the unglamorous side of American democracy \u2013 if you don\u2019t have people to do it? (Related report: \u201c1 out of 5 local election officials say they could quit before 2024 presidential election, new report finds.\u201d) LAH: How are you going to get your small business to open its doors if you don\u2019t have enough people willing to take the beating at the city council meeting? It\u2019s not sexy. It\u2019s not super glamorous, this work, but it is absolutely critical. And people don\u2019t want to do it anymore. We talked to people in our documentary who don\u2019t want to do it anymore because it\u2019s not worth it. The money is not there for them, clearly. And then to not feel that you are safe to go to the grocery store, or to have to be verbally abused in a public meeting. Why does anybody want to do that? WOLF: Since reporting the documentary, I\u2019ve seen you on the 2022 campaign trail. Are you seeing all of this play out on the campaign trail as well? LAH: I think they are in lockstep. They feed off one another. I\u2019m covering national politics right now \u2013 the races that will determine the levers of power in Congress. But the same hostility that we see out here on the campaign trail is the same hostility you\u2019re seeing at school board meetings. And that\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s not about trying to compromise or to win over people to your viewpoint, or to win an argument. It\u2019s about shaming, scaring, terrifying, and most importantly, winning. It\u2019s not compromise. WOLF: It\u2019s my impression that this is still a very small minority of Americans who are using these kinds of tactics or who even feel this way. Do you share that feeling? Or do you think this is a growing movement? LAH: I think it\u2019s a growing movement. Because it\u2019s working. Do I think that this is the fabric of America? I do not. But I think we have got to address this because it\u2019s getting really bad in places that we shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. Teachers shouldn\u2019t have to feel this way. School board members should not have to feel this way. And we\u2019re raising kids in an environment where they think this stuff works. WOLF: What else should we know? LAH: There\u2019s one other thing. These are ordinary people who we talked to. There\u2019s no one famous, and my fear about this is that we\u2019re so drawn to celebrity and the sparkle. I just hope people pay attention to their neighbors and to the unglamorous parts of our society, because they\u2019re the ones who deserve to have a voice. And so that\u2019s why we did it. WOLF: I can tell you care about this. That shines through. LAH: I don\u2019t know why you got into journalism, but I got into journalism because I wanted to give voice to people like my parents, who were immigrants who didn\u2019t speak any English, who didn\u2019t have any power in society. That\u2019s the power of the media, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. And so I feel very passionately about this documentary, and I do hope people watch.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Gov. Tony Evers of Wisconsin and his Republican challenger, Tim Michels, clashed in a debate Friday night over the swing state\u2019s election administration, as Michels vowed to sign into law a series of restrictive voting measures that the incumbent has vetoed. The stylistic differences between the two nominees were on display in Madison in their first and only debate. Evers demonstrated his technocratic approach, diving into detailed proposals to issue child care tax credits, share state government revenue with local governments, eliminate the \u201cminimum markup\u201d law that requires gas stations to charge at least 9% more than what they pay for gas, and reduce state income taxes for middle-class earners by 10%. Four takeaways from Wisconsin's Senate debate Michels was much shorter on specifics, promising \u201cmassive tax reform\u201d without offering details. Instead, he sought to portray Evers as a weak leader. \u201cI\u2019m a businessman. I understand macroeconomics. I understand how to read a balance sheet,\u201d Michels said. The outcome of Wisconsin\u2019s race for governor could have significant implications for the 2024 presidential election \u2013 a contest in which Wisconsin could reprise its role as a marquee swing state. Here are six takeaways from Friday\u2019s gubernatorial debate in the Badger State: Evers defended the integrity of Wisconsin\u2019s elections, saying Republicans were claiming massive fraud in the 2020 presidential election \u201cwithout having any idea or any specifics.\u201d \u201cIt was safe, fair and we can have confidence in our election,\u201d Evers said. The Democratic governor this year vetoed a series of bills approved by the GOP-led legislature that would have imposed new requirements on mail-in voting and new citizenship verification; required the state to deactivate more voter registrations; banned the use of private election grants; and shifted election oversight to the legislature. The focus on 2020 could cost Republicans in this battleground state Michels mentioned \u201cZucker bucks,\u201d a reference to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, donating $350 million to the Center for Tech and Civic Life to help election officials and voters safely navigate the coronavirus pandemic. He also said he would outlaw \u201cballot harvesting,\u201d the practice of allowing another person to hand in a voter\u2019s absentee ballot. And he highlighted a judge\u2019s ruling this fall that led the Wisconsin Elections Commission to withdraw its guidance to clerks to fill in missing information on absentee ballot witness certificates. \u201cI will make sure that once I\u2019m governor, we never have these questions again about election integrity. I will work with the legislature. We will get these bills right \u2013 the bills that Gov. Evers vetoed,\u201d Michels said. Evers and Michels both said they would certify the next election in Wisconsin that takes place while they are governor. Evers said he would certify the outcome of the gubernatorial election \u201cno matter who wins.\u201d \u201cOf course, I will certify the next election,\u201d Michels said. But Michels said the state also needs to address concerns about election security. The Republican has previously embraced former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of fraud in the 2020 presidential election. While he did not promote those claims Friday, he also did not acknowledge that election security concerns exist as a result of Trump\u2019s lies. \u201cI want to make sure, after I\u2019m governor, that we\u2019re not having these conversations two years from now, four years from now, and beyond,\u201d Michels said. Michels said Friday he is \u201cpro-life\u201d but would sign legislation that allows for exceptions for rape and incest to the state\u2019s 1849 abortion ban, which was allowed to take effect after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade this summer. Wisconsin\u2019s GOP-led legislature has not yet advanced a measure to allow such exceptions. Wisconsin Democrats attempt to elevate abortion rights issue in competitive Senate and governor's races The Republican also said he is \u201cnot against contraception\u201d and downplayed the possibility of enforcing criminal penalties against those who seek abortions in other states. \u201cI\u2019m a commonsense guy, and I\u2019ve listened to the people, and I\u2019ll always listen to the people,\u201d Michels said. Evers has pushed state GOP lawmakers to support changing state law to allow for a statewide referendum on the 1849 ban. He recently called lawmakers into a special session urging them to allow citizens to put forth such a referendum, but the GOP-led Assembly and Senate both adjourned in less than 30 seconds without taking action. Evers on Friday described Michels as \u201cradical\u201d on the issue and said Wisconsin should return to the abortion rights protections that existed before Dobbs ruling. \u201cThe bottom line here is this: Women should have the ability and the right to make decisions about their health care, including reproductive health care, and that includes abortion,\u201d Evers said. Evers and Michels also clashed over gun restrictions, with the governor saying he supports universal background checks and \u201cred flag\u201d laws and Michels responding that such laws were unconstitutional. Asked about violent crime in Milwaukee, Michels touted the time he has spent in the city and said many homicides there were a result of knife violence, rather than guns. He said he sees red flag laws as a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d \u201cWith the millions of guns in Wisconsin, we need to make sure that the responsible gun owners are not going to be subject to having their guns taken away without due process,\u201d he said. Evers said his plan to combat gun violence includes sharing state revenue with local governments. He also advocated red flag laws and universal background checks, two gun restrictions that currently have no path forward in the GOP-dominated legislature. \u201cResponsible gun owners don\u2019t have to worry about red flag laws, because it will never be an issue for them,\u201d Evers said. Michels hammered Evers over the Wisconsin parole commission\u2019s decisions to grant hundreds of discretionary paroles not required by law. Those paroles have been routine in the past, but Republicans in Wisconsin have blamed Democrats for increases in violent crime. The state saw a 70% increase in homicides from 2019 to 2021 \u2013 a trend that occurred across the nation and that experts say was driven by the coronavirus pandemic and economic factors. In Wisconsin, Republicans attack Mandela Barnes on crime, offering glimpse at shifting midterm message The paroles, Michels said, showed Evers following through on his 2018 campaign pledge to cut the state\u2019s prison population in half. \u201cThey released over 1,000 convicted felons. They have about 10,000 more to go if you do the simple math,\u201d Michels said. \u201cI will pick a chief parole commissioner who is going to make sure that we have rule of law in Wisconsin.\u201d Evers, meanwhile, pointed out that the parole commission is not controlled by the governor, though the governor does appoint its chair. Commission chair John Tate resigned under criticism in June, which Evers noted was at his urging. \u201cThis is about shared revenue. We can talk about parole, but we also have all sorts of issues in the criminal justice system,\u201d Evers said. Michels shot back: \u201cYou heard, more money, more resources, more resources, and it doesn\u2019t matter about leadership. \u2026 I am going to be tough, and I am going to talk tough.\u201d Evers and Michels also sparred over education, an issue on which Michels supports allowing public dollars to follow students to private schools while Evers wants more funding for public schools. \u201cYou would think that education will be going well under his leadership, but it\u2019s not. Something has to change,\u201d Michels said of Evers, who was the former chief education official in the state before he was governor. He added: \u201cIt can\u2019t get any worst. It will get better because we\u2019re going to empower parents, those tuition dollars are going to go with the parents of the sons and daughters. \u2026 And we\u2019re going to stop the CRT and get back to the ABCs,\u201d Michels said, referring to critical race theory, a concept that has become politicized in recent years. Evers countered: \u201cCRTs are not taught in our schools. And the ABCs are.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lawyers for Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio revealed in court Friday that they plan to argue during their December seditious conspiracy trial that the far-right extremist group was in touch with law enforcement about their plans to rally in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021. Tarrio spoke with Metropolitan Police Lt. Shane Lamond several times about the group\u2019s plans to attend rallies in the district around the time of the 2020 election, according to Nayib Hassan, an attorney for Tarrio. Hassan said he wants to call Lamond as a defense witness. \u201cHow can there be sedition if they\u2019re informing law enforcement\u201d of their plans? Hassan asked District Judge Timothy Kelly during a pretrial conference Friday. Hassan said the officer had been threatened by the Justice Department with obstruction charges if he decides to testify to communications he had with Tarrio because his testimony \u201cwould completely and totally destroy [the DOJ\u2019s] case.\u201d Prosecutor Erik Kenerson categorically denied the allegation, telling Kelly the idea that \u201cthe government has somehow threatened witnesses \u2026 all of that is just categorically false.\u201d Kenerson said witnesses \u201cdon\u2019t belong\u201d to defense attorneys or prosecutors and that defense counsel has known about the government\u2019s contacts with Lamond for months. Tarrio and four other members of the Proud Boys are set to go on trial on December 19 for charges relating to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, including seditious conspiracy. All five have pleaded not guilty. According to sources familiar with the matter, DC Police placed Lamond on administrative leave in February 2022. DC Police told CNN on Friday that Lamond is still on administrative leave but would not comment on the reasons why. \u201cLt. Lamond has dedicated his life to fighting the illegal conduct that occurred on January 6th and is adamantly opposed to those who stoke fear and hatred and denounces the violent conduct of all those who supported the insurrection and attacked our city and our nation on January 6th,\u201d Lamond\u2019s attorney, Mark Schamel, said in a statement. \u201cLt. Lamond\u2019s decorated career has been to protect this city and this nation and he has never done anything to assist the criminals who attacked our democracy on January 6th,\u201d Schamel added. Tarrio told CNN at the time Lamond was placed on leave that he viewed Lamond as his DC Police \u201cliaison\u201d and was in touch with Lamond \u201canytime [Proud Boys] went to rally in DC.\u201d \u201cIt is ridiculous to say that he was doing something improper. He literally was keeping two groups from clashing with one another by letting me know where Antifa or BLM protesters were so that we could avoid running into them,\u201d Tarrio told CNN in a February interview. \u201cIsn\u2019t having communication to prevent violence what community policing is all about?\u201d CNN\u2019s Whitney Wild and Sara Sidner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As President Joe Biden\u2019s administration prepares to hold its first onshore oil and gas drilling lease sales, environmental groups have filed a new lawsuit to attempt to stop the largest of these sales, in Wyoming. It\u2019s the second lawsuit in a week to challenge the administration on its drilling plans. The suit comes as the Biden administration struggles with the political fallout of high gas prices and political attacks from Republicans and Sen. Joe Manchin, a key Democratic vote on Capitol Hill who has been critical of Biden\u2019s energy and climate agenda. Fossil fuel industry cut jobs in 2021 despite growth in production, Energy Department reports Environmental law group Earthjustice filed the complaint on behalf of the Wilderness Society and Friends of the Earth in DC District Court on Wednesday against Department of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland and the Bureau of Land Management. The complaint was shared first with CNN. The groups argue the federal government, in its decision to put the Wyoming parcels up for bid, failed to address the environmental impacts to groundwater and wildlife \u2013 including the threatened sage-grouse, pronghorn and mule deer \u2013 as well as the climate impacts of pumping more planet-warming gas into the air. The groups are targeting the Wyoming sale because of its size; of the 130,000 acres of federal land being offered to oil and gas companies, around 120,000 acres are in Wyoming. \u201cThe Wyoming [sale] is by far the largest,\u201d said Mike Freeman, senior attorney at Earthjustice and the lead attorney in the case. \u201cWhat they\u2019ve done in every state but Wyoming is keep the lease sale really small.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s lawsuit is the latest battle for a group of environmental attorneys that were successful in persuading the DC District Court to invalidate a massive lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico. That case, which was filed last year and decided this past January, effectively halted offshore leasing during the Biden administration\u2019s tenure so far. The legal fight has now moved to dry land. Federal watchdog found oil and gas company likely defrauded government amid agency missteps When the Biden administration announced it would restart onshore oil and gas leasing in April, it was intentional about shrinking the size of the acreage being offered. Interior said at the time it would offer the fossil fuel industry 80% less acreage than what was originally being considered, after a \u201crobust environmental review\u201d and engagement with Native tribes and local communities. A spokesperson for the Department of Interior declined to comment on the lawsuit. Even with the reduction in size, Freeman said Earthjustice is suing because the government failed to adequately consider the environmental cost of the sales. \u201cThe agency acknowledged that production and combustion of oil and gas developed on the leases could generate huge volumes of greenhouse gases and could result in billions of dollars in social and environmental costs,\u201d the complaint states, adding that BLM could have offered less land in Wyoming as it did in other states. \u201cWhat this sale will do is lock in about 188 square miles of public lands for oil and gas for the long-term,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental disconnect with what they\u2019re doing with their lease sale and what they\u2019ve committed on climate.\u201d Interior\u2019s longstanding oil and gas leasing program has been a political hot spot for the administration since Biden took office and vowed to end new drilling leases. Biden\u2019s temporary pause on new leases was challenged by Republicans in court, which prompted the massive Gulf of Mexico lease sale. Then, that sale was stopped and invalidated after Earthjustice and other environmental groups sued. But as gas prices climbed in late 2021 and after Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine, Biden has come under intense political pressure to encourage domestic production of oil and gas, despite his climate promises and goals. Pain at the pump is not what Democrats want heading into a midterm election when they\u2019re widely expected to lose the US House. And the pressure has been intense on Capitol Hill; Republicans and Manchin have criticized Haaland over what they\u2019ve characterized as Interior actively undermining domestic energy production. But Freeman noted that these lease sales could take up to a decade to develop, before they can actively start pumping fossil fuel, or even come close to solving the gas price problem. \u201cThe key point here is that selling these leases will do nothing to help with gas prices,\u201d Freeman said. The onshore lease sales are the only ones the Biden administration has moved on so far. The Department of Interior is soon expected to release its proposed plan for the next five years of offshore oil and gas leasing. If this latest lawsuit is any indication, more court challenges will be coming for the federal government\u2019s planned oil and gas development.",

            "article_content": "CNN has obtained 2,319 text messages that former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows handed over to the January 6 committee that were sent and received between Election Day 2020 and President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, including more than 150 on January 6. Meadows\u2019 texts, which he selectively provided to the panel, show that even those closest to former President Donald Trump believed he had the power to stop the violence in real time. Here\u2019s a minute-by-minute timeline of the notable text messages that Meadows sent and received on January 5 and January 6, which have been verified by CNN. The texts include messages from former White House officials, Meadows associates and Republican members of Congress, as well as Trump\u2019s oldest son. There are also numerous texts from reporters at news organizations such as The New York Times, Politico, Bloomberg, CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News and CNN. Note: CNN has removed personal information from the texts. Errors in spelling and grammar reflect the messages as they were sent, which in some cases include profanity. 2:30 p.m.: Rep.

Jim Jordan to Mark Meadows On January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all \u2013 in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence. \u2018No legislative act,\u2019 wrote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78, \u2018contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.\u2019 \u2018The court in Hubbard v. Lowe reinforced this truth: \u201dThat an unconstitutional statute is not a law at all is a proposition no longer open to discussion.\u2019 \u2019226 F. 135, 137 (SDNY 1915), appeal dismissed, 242 U.S. 654 (1916). \u2019 Following this rationale, an unconstitutionally appointed elector, like an unconstitutionally enacted statute, is no elector at all. 6:42 a.m.: Katrina Pierson to Mark Meadows Good morning.

Violence is never acceptable! MAGA supporters embrace our police and the rule of law and should leave the Capitol now! 2) The fake news media who encouraged this summer\u2019s violent and radical riots are now trying to blame peaceful and innocent MAGA supporters for violent actions.

Somebody needs to come out and calm this down. I believed in Trump and I would probably object to the certification today. You guys need to get Trump to say something to calm down the people, a tweet is not enough. This is crazy. I pray that people of goodwill can act to bring the tensions down. Praying for you and our nation. 3:57 p.m.: Rep. Louie Gohmert to Mark Meadows Cap Police told me last night they\u2019d been warned that today there\u2019d be a lot of Antifa dressed in red Trump shirts & hats & would likely get violent. Good that Trump denounces violence but could add & well demand justice for those who became violent & well get to the bottom of what group they\u2019re with. 3:58 p.m.: Benjamin Tracy to Mark Meadows Is POTUS going to address nation on camera at all? 3:58 p.m.: Brian Kilmeade to Mark Meadows Please get him on tv.

Hasn\u2019t this all gone too far? 4:15 p.m.: Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler to Mark Meadows We need to hear from the president. On TV. I hate that Biden jumped him on it 4:20 p.m.: Reince Priebus to Mark Meadows Good that you made that video 4:21 p.m.: Tom Cors to Mark Meadows thank you 4:51 p.m.: Joel Burgess to Mark Meadows Mark - Joel Burgess from the Asheville Citizen Times here.

He introduces himself w/a suggestion he\u2019s acting on behalf of the president, saying he\u2019s the president\u2019s lawyer. Did Pres Trump ask him to call? Did he know about this effort? I\u2019m filing something shortly. Thanks. Steve 9:16 p.m.: Jennifer Jacobs to Mark Meadows https://twitter.com/jenniferjjacobs/status/1347002690262478848?s=21 9:27 p.m.: Jennifer Jacobs to Mark Meadows nbc says elaine chao considering resigning 9:49 p.m.: Al Weaver to Mark Meadows Are you resigning 9:51 p.m.: Charles Herbster to Mark Meadows From Charles W Herbster: I know all Hell is breaking loose so I want to ENCOURAGE YOU TO HANG IN THERE STAY STRONG and STEADFAST if I can help in anywhere please call or Text 9:56 p.m.: Mark Meadows to Charles Herbster Thanks my friend. Really appreciate the note. I look forward to working with you in the future for our country\u2019s benefit 10:01 p.m.: Jason Miller to Mark Meadows, Dan Scavino and Jared Kushner Chief, Jared, Dan - below please find an approved statement from the President to go out right as they\u2019re finalizing the votes, which we\u2019re expecting to be 3am, though with some Members caving it could happen earlier. Mrs. Trump has also signed off. Nobody but the four of us have heard this statement. Regarding logistics, this likely should come from the WH, but it has to be ready to go out as they\u2019re starting the final vote, and I\u2019ll background that a statement will be coming at the time of the vote. Even though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. Nevertheless, there will be an orderly transition on January 20th. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it\u2019s only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again. 10:02 p.m.: Charles Herbster to Mark Meadows YOU ARE THE BEST THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO FOR ALL OF US!!!!!! 10:10 p.m.: Jared Kushner to Mark Meadows, Jason Miller and Dan Scavino Why don\u2019t we post on his Facebook page since he isn\u2019t locked out there\u2026 10:13 p.m.: Dan Scavino to Mark Meadows, Jason Miller and Jared Kushner I\u2019ll be up, let me know when ok to drop, and it\u2019s official\u2026just got off w/them. 10:21 p.m.: Mark Meadows to Al Weaver Off the record. No 10:30 p.m.: Kristen Welker to Mark Meadows I\u2019m hearing he\u2019s going to concede - true? 10:47 p.m.: Kayla Tausche to Mark Meadows Hi Congressman. Kayla from CNBC here. Are you planning to stay in the administration until 1/20? Do you have any reaction to reports that Cabinet secretaries are considering invoking the 25th amendment?",

            "article_content": "Celebrity TV host Mehmet Oz arrived at a fire station in a small town outside Philadelphia on Saturday, seeking to convince the roughly 25 people gathered that he was a real part of the MAGA movement created by the man who backed him, former President Donald Trump. The challenges have stacked up against Oz in the crucial Pennsylvania Senate Republican primary, from one opponent\u2019s relentless attacks portraying him as a \u201cHollywood liberal\u201d to a late surge by another candidate embraced by the grassroots. But here in Secane, Oz portrayed himself as the kind of conservative who would \u201cnever let you down,\u201d proudly noting Trump said he is the most electable GOP candidate in the race that could determine the future party control of the Senate. \u201cOne of the reasons that President Trump endorsed me,\u201d the heart surgeon told the potential voters gathered here, \u201cwas because after doing all the work of calculating who\u2019s most likely to win in November he decided I was the person.\u201d 'Nervous about Oz's prospects': Trump and his allies worry about a Barnette victory in Pennsylvania Afterward, Oz appeared to win over at least one undecided voter, who had seen the attacks critiquing Oz\u2019s past, more moderate views on abortion and gun control. Jonathan Menta, a 52-year-old corporate audit manager, said he was impressed by Oz\u2019s pitch, especially on increasing natural gas production in the state, and could now see himself supporting him. \u201cI received a lot of literature at my home that say that Dr. Oz is more Republican in Name Only,\u201d Menta said. \u201cIt sounds like today though, if he\u2019s true to his word and what he was speaking about today, that those may be mischaracterizations of his positions.\u201d Richard Koehler didn\u2019t need to be convinced: He was already all in for Oz. \u201cI like his ideas, his questions. He\u2019s a conservative by nature and seems genuine.\u201d The fact that Trump endorsed Oz, \u201cput the icing on the cake.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s primary will not only nominate a GOP candidate in the pivotal Senate race but will also be the latest test of Trump\u2019s sway over the Republican Party. Dozens of Trump supporters at rallies this past week for deep-pocketed candidate David McCormick said that Trump\u2019s endorsement did not factor into their decision, and expressed a distrust and dislike of Oz. Jeff McHugh, 46, described Oz as a RINO \u2013 \u201cRepublican In Name Only\u201d \u2013 and said he thought Oz was only running as a Republican because he had determined he could win the most support among that group of voters. \u201cI\u2019m definitely a pro-Trump guy, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m pro-Oz,\u201d McHugh said. Larry, a 66-year-old retired contractor wearing a MAGA hat, described Oz as \u201cphony\u201d and \u201cfake.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a turncoat. I don\u2019t trust him. He\u2019s got that look about his face. He\u2019s got that smirky smirk that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Larry said. He said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d why Trump endorsed him. Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, whose retirement created the race for the open seat, told CNN \u201cit\u2019s hard to say\u201d how much of a difference Trump\u2019s endorsement of Oz is going to make. \u201cI think it\u2019s quite possible that it won\u2019t be a huge factor,\u201d said Toomey, because Oz is already so well-known after 13 seasons of his daytime TV talk show. Toomey has not endorsed a candidate. Interviews with dozens of Republican voters across the state reveal many are waiting until the last moment to decide which candidate they\u2019ll cast their ballot. Rich Walzak, 64, said he\u2019s still undecided because he\u2019s looking for a candidate who is trustworthy, committed to following through on promises and can beat a Democrat in November. \u201cEverybody has good points, but I\u2019m looking for somebody, whether it\u2019s a man or a woman \u2013 just keep your word. Be true to yourself,\u201d Walzak said. \u201cBut you have to be realistic. It\u2019s not so much who you like, it\u2019s who can carry the bag.\u201d The latest Fox News public poll shows Oz is statistically tied with hedge fund McCormick and political commentator Kathy Barnette. Barnette, a Black woman, has surged at the last minute, even though her campaign is spending just $63,000 on air in the final week of the race. Barnette slams GOP rivals at closed event as spotlight on late-surging Pennsylvania Senate hopeful intensifies She grew her support from within the MAGA movement, after refusing to concede her 19-point loss for a US House seat in 2020, organizing buses to attend Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6, 2021, and searching for fraudulent votes. She campaigned with Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, the presumed frontrunner who has pushed the lie that Trump won the 2020 election. And she emphasized her anti-abortion position in describing her personal story as the daughter of a girl who had been raped. This week, Barnette reiterated her opposition to Mitch McConnell as Senate Republican leader, while he was visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky with a GOP US Senate delegation in Kyiv Saturday, and criticized Oz for not explicitly objecting to a $40 billion bill in aid for Ukraine. \u201cAmerica First,\u201d she tweeted. She won endorsements from socially conservative groups like Susan B. Anthony List and CatholicVote, and the anti-tax organization Club for Growth, which is spending nearly $2 million on her behalf. Janet Shearer, 76, said she\u2019s 75% sure she\u2019s going to vote for Barnette in the primary. \u201cShe tells it like it is and she\u2019s a fighter and she loves Trump \u2013 and I love Trump,\u201d Shearer said. But sitting one table over, Bill McCoach, 66, said he thinks Barnette\u2019s whole candidacy is a \u201cscam.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s part of the left. She\u2019s lying,\u201d McCoach said. Several other Republicans echoed McCoach\u2019s skepticism, saying they don\u2019t know much about Barnette but have started hearing negative things about her in the past week. Earl Olinger, 68, said he initially liked Barnette, but changed his mind when he saw a TV ad this week that accused her of being \u201cagainst Trump.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a big Trump guy. So yeah, if you\u2019re against Trump I have a little problem with that because everything he did was good by my standards,\u201d Olinger said. Barnette\u2019s advance has worried Oz, McCormick and also Trump, who said in a recent statement that she would not be able to win the general election. This week, a super PAC supporting Oz released an attack ad misleading viewers about her views on Black Lives Matter and systemic racism among police officers. Bob Gillies, Barnette\u2019s campaign manager, told CNN that her words were taken completely out of context to make it appear she supported BLM even though she had been on record opposing it. \u201cYou need to play the whole video,\u201d he said. Allies and advisors for McCormick, who went to West Point and earned a Bronze Star while serving in the first Gulf War, have raised questions about Barnette\u2019s military service, including how she was discharged from the Army. Barnette also has a history of anti-Muslim and anti-gay statements; Oz has called some of her past tweets \u201cclearly homophobic\u201d or \u201cIslamophobic.\u201d McCormick told CNN that he \u201cdidn\u2019t anticipate anything quite like\u201d Barnette\u2019s unexpected ascent, in part because he has never run for office before. He also told the MAGA base in a podcast with former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon that he has \u201cno allegiance\u201d to McConnell and would oppose the Ukraine bill. Asked about Barnette, Oz replied, \u201cThe real question for a lot of voters is should they roll the dice?\u201d He then accused the Club for Growth of \u201cturning Kathy into a pawn in a fight with President Trump.\u201d \u201cFunny things happen in multi-candidate races,\u201d Toomey told CNN when asked about her polling surge, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot \u2026 the voters don\u2019t know about her.\u201d Barnette\u2019s rise in the polls has disrupted a primary race that has been dominated for months by a bitter fight between Oz and McCormick. Honor Pennsylvania, a super PAC backing McCormick, spent $17 million on ads almost exclusively attacking Oz before targeting Barnette this week. In the ugly Senate primary, McCormick has accused Oz of being a \u201cHollywood liberal\u201d who had \u201cdual loyalties\u201d because he was a dual US-Turkey citizen. Oz, meanwhile, has accused McCormick of being beholden to China, airing an ad warning voters about McCormick\u2019s financial investments in the country to the sound of a banging gong. Oz on Saturday dismissed attacks on his ties to Turkey, including from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who held a press conference with McCormick\u2019s campaign last week raising questions about Oz\u2019s \u201cconnection to the Turkish government.\u201d Oz was born in the US, and has said he still has dual citizenship to help take care of his mom, who has Alzheimer\u2019s, in Turkey, but would renounce his Turkish citizenship if elected. \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction, purely partisan,\u201d Oz said in response to a question from CNN. McCormick is still defending himself from attacks that he is too cozy with China. He spoke favorably of China as a top Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration and was CEO of the massive hedge fund Bridgewater when the company raised $1.3 billion for a new private fund in China. At a recent campaign event in Lititz, Pennsylvania, McCormick compared himself to Trump and said that a small portion of his global business was in China. \u201cBy the way, that\u2019s a lot like President Trump, who did business in Russia and China and other countries before he came in office,\u201d McCormick said at a campaign event on Friday. \u201cNo one has the credentials and the toughness to go toe to toe with China like I do.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "A deputy attorney general in Virginia resigned Thursday after Facebook posts resurfaced in which she called rioters who had stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, \u201cpatriots\u201d and made reference to the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Monique Miles, a now-former deputy for Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, is the latest public official to face public backlash for comments made about the insurrection at the Capitol. \u201cNews Flash: Patriots have stormed the Capitol. No surprise. The deep state has awoken the sleeping giant,\u201d Miles wrote on the day of the riot, according to The Washington Post, which first reported her posts. \u201cPatriots are not taking this lying down. We are awake, ready and will fight for our rights by any means necessary.\u201d Miles later edited her Facebook post, claiming that the mob was \u201cantifa dressed as Patriots\u201d and \u201cPatriots are peace loving, Antifa and BLM are not,\u201d according to the newspaper. Iraq War vet who punched police officers is 100th US Capitol rioter to be sentenced In comments on her post, Miles allegedly referred to the riot as a \u201cpeaceful protest\u201d and said people shouldn\u2019t believe the mainstream media. The Virginia Attorney General\u2019s Office said it had not seen Miles\u2019 comments before they had been reported by the Post, and denounced both what she said on Facebook and the Capitol riot itself. \u201cThis information was unknown to the Office of the Attorney General prior to this morning,\u201d said Victoria LaCivita, a spokesperson for Miyares. \u201cMs. Miles has resigned from her position at the Office of the Attorney General.\u201d \u201cThe attorney general has been very clear: Joe Biden won the election and he has condemned the January 6 attack,\u201d LaCivita added, addressing comments by Miles endorsing the lie that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election. CNN has attempted to reach Miles. Miles told the Post that her Facebook posts \u201chave been taken out of context.\u201d \u201cThe posts were made at a time when the news was still developing re: the facts around the election, the court cases, the Rally on the Ellipse and what happened at the capitol,\u201d she wrote in an email to the newspaper. \u201cThat was before all the audits occurred.\u201d \u201cWhat we know now about the election today is very different from what we knew on Election Day 2020 or even what we knew on the day that President Biden was inaugurated in January 2021. I believe he is our president as he was certified as such,\u201d she added, according to the Post. On Thursday, a disabled Iraq War veteran who pleaded guilty to punching two police officers in the head during the attack became the 100th member of the mob that stormed the Capitol to be sentenced in federal court,  according to CNN records. The Justice Department shows no signs of slowing down its probe into January 6, charging new defendants and striking new plea deals almost every day. So far this year, the department has arrested more than 25 new defendants, and has suggested there are still hundreds to pursue.",
