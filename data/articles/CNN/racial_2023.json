            "article_content": "I was cradling my newborn son one night in November 2016 when I suddenly began to sob. Something had dawned on me that filled me with fear. I was the mother of a Black son in America. I was born in Kenya and moved to the US after high school to attend college. I have long felt a conflict between my race and my nationality. In some ways, I didn\u2019t know I was Black until I came to the US. That night, as I held my son, Liam, and listened to TV pundits debate what the presidential election results meant for people of color, I felt frightened for his future. I knew that no matter how he chose to define himself as the son of two Kenyan immigrants, he would be seen first and foremost as a Black man. And I was well aware of the prejudices that come with that label. Despite living in the US for years and covering incidents of racism as a journalist, I wasn\u2019t sure I was equipped to help him navigate life in a country where race is such a hot-button issue. With my son\u2019s birth, the dynamic of my life in America had changed. I could no longer observe issues of race as a bystander from another country who wasn\u2019t sure where she fit in the conversation. I was the mother of a Kenyan American son, a Black son. To keep him safe, I knew I had to evolve. Little did I know my son would show me a new perspective on my adopted country. For the first half of my life, I had never worried about my Blackness or looked at my life through the lens of race. In Kenya, where more than 90% of the population is Black, race was never a factor in how we viewed the world. In Kenya, there are tensions around colorism, class and different ethnicities. But except for South Africa, issues around Black and White identity are non-existent in a lot of African countries, said Karsonya Wise Whitehead, associate professor of African and African American Studies at Loyola University. \u201cWhen I was in Kenya, the guy who took my bag (at the airport) was Black. The guy who flew the plane was Black. The president was Black,\u201d said Whitehead, who\u2019s traveled to many African countries. \u201cAs a Black person from an African country, you haven\u2019t seen the long history of oppression, the long history of social injustice that those of us who were born here, who are descendants of enslaved people, have seen.\u201d I came to the US roughly two decades ago to attend Grambling State University, a historically Black school in northern Louisiana. I remained at Grambling for both my undergraduate and graduate studies, which shielded me from racial injustices for the first few years of my American life. But that doesn\u2019t mean there were no racial tensions. One night in February, while we were working on a joint newspaper project with White journalism students from a nearby university, a debate erupted over the need for Black History Month. I watched it silently from the sidelines, not quite sure what to do. In the United States, I\u2019ve experienced more instances of ignorance about Africa than overt racism. People have asked me all sorts of questions: How did I get here when there are no planes in Africa? Did we have wild animals roaming the streets? Do I run marathons like the elite Kenyan runners? Most of the discrimination I faced was not about race, directly, but my status as an immigrant. After I graduated from college with a journalism degree and applied for a copy-editing internship at a newspaper in Oregon, the recruiter called to tell me they\u2019d chosen another candidate. In a moment of candor, he revealed that even though I\u2019d passed an editing test with flying colors, their main concern was that as an immigrant from a country considered non-English speaking, I would struggle in a job where American English takes center stage. My first newsroom job was as a copy editor at a small newspaper in Monroe, Louisiana. I took note of the lack of diversity in that and every other newsroom I walked into. But I was mostly busy trying to prove myself, trying to convince the reporter who looked at me quizzically when I questioned a detail in her story that despite my accent, I was indeed fluent in English, and I could edit as well as my American peers. I was oblivious to racial microaggressions. As an immigrant in a new job, I was too busy fighting to survive. And as a child of two worlds, there was so much to learn, and unlearn. For example, as someone who grew up in a former British colony, I had to work on replacing my Britishisms to survive in a US newsroom. Open the trunk of the car, not the boot. Grab some cookies, not biscuits. Order some French fries, not chips. In Kenya, when I was growing up, looking someone in the eye was viewed as defiance. In the United States, when you don\u2019t look someone in the eye, it\u2019s considered a sign of impoliteness, or deceit. Back in Kenya, challenging the opinion of someone older than you was considered disrespectful, something my husband and I had to unlearn after moving to the US. But our son has never lived in Kenya, so he does not share our cultural baggage and cannot relate to our lives before the US. He looks at people straight in the eye and says no to us when he wants to. It\u2019s a reminder that while our lives were shaped by our backgrounds as immigrants, his will be shaped by his experiences as a Black man in the US. He will face exclusively American problems. To raise a Black son, my husband and I realized we needed to arm ourselves with new knowledge. We needed to worry less about nuances of nationality and culture, and focus more on issues of race. We share these challenges with many other Black immigrants, a growing demographic in the US. More than 4.6 million Black immigrants live in the US, a jump from the roughly 800,000 in 1980, according to a Pew study. This parallels the overall rise in immigration to the US over the past half century. While most Black immigrants come from Caribbean nations like Jamaica and Haiti, Africa has accounted for the fastest growth in the Black immigrant population since 2000, the Pew study found. Many Black immigrants of our era arrived here with little knowledge of African American culture or history. Growing up in Kenya, my dad was a big fan of Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton, and blared country music on his little red cassette tape player on weekends. State-run TV aired Indian movies and Mexican telenovelas. If we wanted to learn about Black culture in America, we had to seek it out by renting VHS tapes of \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\u201d \u201cMartin,\u201d \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d and BET music videos. As a high school student with no money, I gravitated to the free syndicated shows on TV. My siblings and I could perform complicated Bollywood dance moves and recite Mexican soap opera scenes faster than we could explain the Black experience in America. Everything I knew about the US civil rights movement, I learned in college and thereafter. A history class in my freshman year introduced me to the centuries of slavery and inequality in the US. I remember being shocked to hear about this, because in Kenya, we had viewed the US as a model of human rights and democracy. I marveled at the courage of Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman and other Black historical figures. And I was horrified when I discovered the symbolism behind the Confederate flags I saw everywhere while driving around rural Louisiana. But I learned everything with a sense of detachment, because I was too busy trying to build a new life. I spent the years after my 2006 graduation working at newspapers in Louisiana, California and Baltimore before moving to Atlanta. I noted the racial tensions and the lack of diversity in most professional spaces I was in, but as an immigrant, I still looked at it from a bystander\u2019s perspective. Then I had a son, and my thinking shifted. My husband and I soon realized we were raising Liam to understand his Kenyan background but neglecting his Americanness. How would we teach him to appreciate his Kenyan roots but also grasp the complexities around racial issues in this country? My son reminded me of this delicate balance when he overheard my sister and I having \u201cThe Talk\u201d with his older cousin. As Black Americans know too well, The Talk is the advice Black parents give their children about how to behave when encountering police. If police pull you over, put your hands on the steering wheel where an officer can see them. Ask before you move your hands \u2013 even to get a wallet or your driver\u2019s license. Don\u2019t make any sudden moves. If you\u2019re wearing a hoodie, don\u2019t cover your head while walking down the street. Don\u2019t put your hands in your pockets around an officer or in a store. \u201cDo you have to do the same police stuff in Kenya, too?\u201d my son asked. I responded haltingly, thinking about every word. We thought he was still too young for The Talk. \u201cUm, no, in Kenya it\u2019s different. You don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d That was followed by every 6-year-old\u2019s favorite word: Why? Both countries have their own unique histories and differences, I told him, so they have their own ways of doing things. He still looked puzzled. It\u2019s hard to explain this to a 6-year-old without demonizing the police, so we let it go and will revisit the subject when he\u2019s a little older and can find some balance. But we are gradually addressing topics of race with him. We\u2019ve told him that people come in all shades, and they are all beautiful. We\u2019re taking him to African American historical sites, such as Martin Luther King\u2019s boyhood home here in Atlanta. And we read aloud to him from a book he got for his 6th birthday called, \u201cLittle Legends: Exceptional Men in Black History,\u201d which features brief profiles of pioneering American figures such as Frederick Douglass and Thurgood Marshall. Its introduction says, \u201cWhoever you are, there is a story for you in the pages that follow.\u201d In October 2016, when we became parents, the heartbreaking stories of Black men killed by police or racist vigilantes took on a sudden urgency. After the death last month of Irvo Otieno, a Kenyan American who died in police custody in Virginia, my son overheard me talking to Otieno\u2019s mother by phone. As soon as I hung up, Liam asked, \u201cwhy did they kill him? \u201d I didn\u2019t know how to answer that. News headlines are a reminder that young Black men \u2013 even Black children \u2013 face constant threats in this country. Two years before our son was born, 12-year-old Tamir Rice was shot and killed in Ohio by police who found him playing with a toy gun. And two years before that, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by a neighborhood watch captain in Florida. Conversations with fellow mothers from other African countries made me realize I\u2019m not alone in my fears. A lot of them give their sons the talk on how to deal with police encounters. It\u2019s a hard talk, but it\u2019s necessary. Some parents give it again and again to remind their kids that despite their nationalities, they will be seen as Black first. After years of shying away from discussing race issues, I\u2019m having those conversations more openly now with friends of all races, nationalities and backgrounds. I\u2019m educating myself so I can feel empowered to answer my son\u2019s questions. Abdullahi Boru Halakhe, an expert on East and Southern Africa, says it\u2019s not unusual for immigrants from the continent to avoid race issues at first for several reasons. \u201cTheir experiences with racism are limited \u2013 especially on a personal level,\u201d said Halakhe, a senior advocate at Refugees International. \u201cAdditionally, most arrive via school or work. As a result, they put their heads down and focus \u2026 Many are in the rat race to join the job market, or go back to their home countries. There is a gulf in knowledge and understanding, especially the nuances and personal experiences.\u201d But Halakhe believes it\u2019s crucial for African immigrants to be a part of the conversation on race. \u201cWhen you walk on the streets, there\u2019s not distinguishing marker to a racist,\u201d he said.  \u201cAs people from the African continent, when we arrive on these shores, we have a responsibility to learn and engage on racism. The historical depth of linkage between Africa and African Americans is long. African American causes are our causes.\u201d I\u2019ve now spent more of my life in the US than in Kenya. Some days, I feel more American than Kenyan. Other days, I feel like I\u2019m straddling two worlds and will never fully belong to one or the other. But our son is quick to correct us every time my husband or I refer to him as a Kenyan. \u201cKenyan American,\u201d he says. He loves chasing after goats at his grandfather\u2019s farm in Kenya and is a big fan of African soccer stars in the English premier league. But while he\u2019s learned to celebrate both sides of his culture, he identifies with his American life more. He prefers mac and cheese to Kenyan food, loves American sports and fire trucks, and always reminds us to leave a tip in restaurants in Kenya, where tipping is not part of the culture. His clarity on where he belongs has forced me to confront both the good and the bad of living in the US. I\u2019m no longer an immigrant who is unsure whether to join conversations about race. I\u2019m an American, and the proud mother of a Black son.",

The city of Louisville will hold a vigil today to let community members grieve the five people killed this week in a bank shooting. The vigil comes a day after police released dramatic police body camera footage of the shooting at Old National Bank, in which authorities say a 25-year-old employee opened fire on his colleagues and then engaged in a shootout with police before he was shot dead. The shooter\u2019s motive for the rampage remains unclear at this time as authorities continue to comb through evidence. However, officials are expected to release audio today of 911 calls that could reveal more key details, according to Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg. The mayor on Tuesday also pleaded for state and federal assistance in addressing gun violence in Kentucky, which has some of the least restrictive state gun laws in the nation. About 2,000 people in eastern Indiana received evacuation orders Tuesday after a large fire at a recycling plant began emitting toxic smoke. The fire, which created a thick, black plume over industrial buildings and a neighborhood, is expected to burn for days \u2013 and is \u201cdefinitely toxic,\u201d Indiana State Fire Marshal Steve Jones said. \u201cThere is a host of different chemicals that plastics give off when they\u2019re on fire, and it\u2019s concerning and we want to make for sure we give people heads-up on an evacuation,\u201d Jones said. A preliminary investigation determined the fire started in a nearby semi-trailer before spreading to the facility, an official said, adding the exact cause will likely remain unknown until after it has been extinguished. The leaked classified Pentagon documents posted to social media suggest the US is pessimistic that Ukraine can quickly end the war against Russia. The documents highlight specific weaknesses in both Ukraine\u2019s weaponry and Russia\u2019s military offensive, predicting a stalemate for months to come. The documents also indicate some intelligence that defense officials are gathering about China, the country Washington has deemed the \u201cmost serious long-term challenge to the international order.\u201d Officials say the leaking of the documents \u2013 many of which are marked top secret \u2013 represents a major national security breach. The Justice Department has launched a criminal investigation into who may have leaked them while the Pentagon is investigating how the leak impacts US national security. A major cyclone is threatening to hit Western Australia with winds strong enough to lift camper vans and trampolines. Australia\u2019s Bureau of Meteorology said Cyclone Ilsa is expected to make landfall late Thursday or early Friday, somewhere between the towns of Broome and Port Hedland. The storm is expected to generate wind gusts of more than 250 kph (155 mph) by Thursday evening, equivalent to a Category 4 or 5 hurricane in the US. Local authorities warned residents to tie down anything that could become airborne and urged tourists to move from the projected path of the storm. Many people have flocked to supermarkets to stock up on food and other supplies ahead of the dangerous conditions. A rural Texas county that was ordered to return banned books to its public library shelves is now considering shutting down its libraries entirely. A meeting in Llano County today will include a discussion of whether to \u201ccontinue or cease operations\u201d of the library system, which includes three branches. The meeting comes after a federal judge last month ordered the library system to return 12 children\u2019s books to its shelves that had been removed, many because of their LGBTQ and racial content. It also follows several ongoing fights across the country to protect access to books in response to a boom of book bans that has taken shape in the US \u2013 including in K-12 schools, universities and public libraries.

            "article_content": "Four days after being expelled by Tennessee\u2019s Republican-controlled House of Representatives, Democrat Justin Jones marched back to the Capitol on Monday following a unanimous vote by the Nashville Metropolitan Council to reappoint him as an interim representative. His return representing Nashville\u2019s House District 52 put a exclamation point on a remarkable 100-hour stretch in which Jones and another Black Democrat, Justin Pearson, lost their seats in an extraordinary, emotionally charged legislative session, after calling for gun reform during a protest on the chamber floor. A third Democrat who had joined them, Rep. Gloria Johnson, narrowly avoided expulsion during Thursday\u2019s House session. Jones returned to the House floor to cheers. His fellow Democrat, Rep. Antonio Parkinson, introduced him to the session as \u201cour newest member.\u201d After the city council decision late in the afternoon, Jones joined demonstrators in a march to the state Capitol. The crowd gathered at the meeting erupted into cheers after the vote. Those marching with Jones chanted, \u201cWhose house? Our House.\u201d Tennessee House GOP expels 2 Democrats in retaliation over gun control protest, on 'sad day for democracy' Speaking from the steps of the Capitol after walking the four blocks from City Hall, Jones told the crowd: \u201cToday we are sending a resounding message that democracy will not be killed in the comfort of silence. Today we send a clear message to Speaker Cameron Sexton that the people will not allow his crimes against democracy to happen without challenge.\u201d State law allows local legislative bodies to appoint interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held. The 36-0 vote to return Jones to his seat followed a vote to suspend a procedural rule that prevents an individual from being nominated and appointed to the seat in the same meeting. On Thursday, Jones and Pearson were forced out of the legislature in a two-thirds majority vote cast by their Republican colleagues. Johnson, a White woman, survived the vote and held on to her seat. Sexton earlier indicated he would not stand in the way of the appointments if the local governing bodies choose to send Jones and Pearson back to the chamber. \u201cThe two governing bodies will make the decision as to who they want to appoint to these seats,\u201d a spokesperson for the speaker\u2019s office told CNN Monday. \u201cThose two individuals will be seated as representatives as the constitution requires.\u201d Pearson\u2019s vacant District 86 seat will be addressed during a special meeting of the Shelby County Board of Commissioners in Memphis on Wednesday afternoon, Commission Chairman Mickell Lowery said. \u201cI believe the expulsion of State Representative Justin Pearson was conducted in a hasty manner without consideration of other corrective action methods,\u201d Lowery said in a statement. Pearson joined Jones on the steps of the Capitol after the Nashville Metropolitan Council vote. \u201cIt\u2019s never a good idea to give up on the movement led by people that look like this, who are committed to the ideals but not just committed in heart but in body and spirit\u2026 they\u2019ll show up for the movement,\u201d Pearson said. \u201cThe movement lives.\u201d Having a voice and a vision in the state House matters, Pearson told supporters. \u201cYou might try and silence it. You might try and expel it, but the people\u2019s power will not be stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause this is what democracy looks like.\u201d Protesters planned a day of action that included a rally before the Metro Council meeting before the march to the state Capitol. The expulsions and expected protest are part of the long-standing debate over the accessibility of guns in America, with this latest standoff spurred by the mass shooting last month at a Nashville Christian school that left six people dead, including three 9-year-old children. In the wake of that shooting, Jones, Pearson and Johnson took to the state House floor to advocate for gun control, using a bullhorn to address their colleagues and protesters. Republicans accused the trio of \u201cknowingly and intentionally\u201d bringing \u201cdisorder and dishonor to the House of Representatives\u201d without being recognized to speak, CNN affiliate WSMV reported. Republicans then held a party-line vote Thursday to oust Jones and Pearson. The expelled representatives called the expulsions undemocratic and racist. Hear lawmaker's message to the Republicans that voted to expel him from the state house \u201cWhat happened was a travesty of democracy because they expelled the two youngest Black lawmakers, which is no coincidence from the Tennessee Legislature,\u201d Jones said Friday on \u201cCNN This Morning.\u201d \u201cBecause we are outspoken, because we fight for our district.\u201d Pearson, speaking at an Easter Sunday service at The Church of the River in Memphis, thanked the congregation and community for their support. \u201cThe Republican-led supermajority of the Tennessee General Assembly sought to have a political lynching of three of its members because we spoke out of turn against the status quo of the government, after the tragic deaths of six people in the shooting at The Covenant School in Nashville,\u201d he said. Attorneys for the ousted representatives \u2013 among them former US Attorney General Eric Holder \u2013 called their removals \u201cunconstitutional\u201d in a letter Monday to Sexton, saying, \u201cTheir partisan expulsion was extraordinary, illegal and without any historical or legal precedent.\u201d The letter from Holder and attorney Scott J. Crosby \u2013 who are representing Jones and Pearson, respectively \u2013 urged the House to not \u201ccompound its errors by taking any further retributive actions.\u201d \u201cThe world is watching Tennessee,\u201d the letter said. \u201cAny partisan retributive action, such as the discriminatory treatment of elected officials, or threats or actions to withhold funding for government programs, would constitute further unconstitutional action that would require redress.\u201d According to the Tennessee Constitution, since the next general election is more than 12 months away, in November 2024, a special election will be held to fill the seats. Tennessee law allows for the appointment of interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until the special election is held. No date has been set for a special election but state law provides a time frame for when the governor should schedule them. Rep. Justin Pearson:    A \u201cwrit of election\u201d for \u201cprimary elections for nominations by statewide political parties to fill the vacancy\u201d must be scheduled within 55 to 60 days, state code says. And a general election to fill the vacancy must be scheduled within 100 to 107 days. It appears both Jones and Pearson qualify to run for their seats again in the special election. According to Tennessee law, a state representative must be at least 21 years old, a US citizen, a resident of the state for at least three years and a resident of their county for one year preceding the election. They must also be a qualified voter of the district, which requires a resident to be 18 years old and free of certain felony convictions. Both Jones and Pearson meet those qualifications. And while the state Constitution says members can be expelled for disorderly behavior with a two-thirds majority vote, they cannot be expelled \u201ca second time for the same offense.\u201d Expelling lawmakers is quite rare in Tennessee, and last week\u2019s vote from the state\u2019s Republican supermajority has drawn reactions from scores of high profile officials. On Thursday, President Joe Biden called the expulsions \u201cshocking, undemocratic and without precedent\u201d while criticizing Republicans for not taking greater action on gun reform. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Nashville on Friday to advocate for stricter gun control measures and highlight the importance of protecting Americans from gun violence. She also privately met with Jones, Pearson and Johnson. \u201cWe understand when we took an oath to represent the people who elected us that we speak on behalf of them.

The last expulsion in the state House was in 2016, when a representative was expelled over allegations of sexual harassment. In 1980, a representative was expelled after a member was found guilty of accepting a bribe while in office. Standing on the Tennessee House floor for the first time after being reinstated, Jones said, \u201cI want to welcome the people back to the people\u2019s House.\u201d \u201cToday we stand as witness to the resurrection of a movement of a multi-racial democracy, that no unjust decision will stand,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe people of District 52, all 78,000 people, have a voice in this chamber once again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wolfe, Raja Razek, Eric Levenson, Steve Almasy, Raja Razek, Dakin Andone, Andi Babineau, Kelly McCleary, Ryan Young, Michelle Watson, Arlette Saenz, Dianne Gallagher, Tina Burnside and Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Two Democratic members of the Tennessee House of Representatives were expelled while a third member was spared in an ousting by Republican lawmakers that was decried by the trio as oppressive, vindictive and racially motivated. Protesters packed the state Capitol on Thursday to denounce the expulsions of Reps. Justin Jones and Rep. Justin Pearson and to advocate for gun reform measures a little over a week after a mass shooting devastated a Nashville school. Tennessee's Republican-led House expels 2 Democratic lawmakers over gun reform protest, fails in bid to oust a third Speaking to CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on \u201cCNN This Morning,\u201d Jones decried the actions of House Republicans. \u201cWhat happened yesterday was a very sad day for democracy,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThe nation was able to see we don\u2019t have democracy in Tennessee.\u201d Jones confirmed if he is reappointed to the seat by the 40-member Nashville Metro Council, he would serve. \u201cI have no regrets. I will continue to stand up for my constituents.\u201d Nashville City Council Member Russ Bradford told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota he would be voting to send Jones back to the State House. \u201cThat is who the people of House District 52 elected this last November and so it\u2019s very important that, unlike my state legislature, I will listen to the voice of my constituents and I will do what needs to be done to support democracy in this state,\u201d Bradford said. Following their expulsion \u2013 which House Republicans said was in response to the representatives\u2019 leadership of gun control demonstrations on the chamber floor last week \u2013 Jones and Pearson called for protesters to return to the Capitol when the House is back in session on Monday. Rep. Gloria Johnson, who is White and wasn\u2019t ousted, slammed the votes removing Jones and Pearson, who are Black, as racist. Asked by CNN why she believes she wasn\u2019t expelled, Johnson said the reason is \u201cpretty clear.\u201d \u201cI am a 60-year-old White woman, and they are two young Black men,\u201d Johnson said. She added that Pearson and Jones were questioned in a \u201cdemeaning way\u201d by lawmakers before their expulsion. President Joe Biden on Thursday called the expulsions \u201cshocking, undemocratic and without precedent,\u201d and criticized Republicans for not taking greater action on gun reform. Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Nashville Friday to advocate for stricter gun control measures and highlight the importance of protecting Americans from gun violence. She also privately met with Jones, Pearson and Johnson. \u201cWe understand when we took an oath to represent the people who elected us that we speak on behalf of them. It wasn\u2019t about the three of these leaders,\u201d Harris said in remarks after the meeting. \u201cIt was about who they were representing. it\u2019s about whose voices they were channeling. Understand that \u2014 and is that not what a democracy allows?\u201d After a shooter killed three 9-year-old students and three adults at a private Christian elementary school in Nashville last week, Jones, Pearson and Johnson staged a demonstration on the House floor calling for gun reform and leading chants with a bullhorn. Jones said he and the other lawmakers had been blocked from speaking about gun violence on the House floor that week, saying that their microphones were cut off whenever they raised the topic, according to CNN affiliate WSMV. Following the three representatives\u2019 demonstrations last Thursday, Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton called their actions \u201cunacceptable\u201d and argued that they broke \u201cseveral rules of decorum and procedure on the House floor.\u201d On Monday, three resolutions were filed seeking the expulsions of Jones, Pearson and Johnson. The three members had already been removed from their committee assignments following the protest. Young children, a substitute teacher, the head of their school and its custodian. These are the victims of the Nashville school shooting The resolutions, filed by Republican Reps. Bud Hulsey, Gino Bulso and Andrew Farmer, said the lawmakers \u201cdid knowingly and intentionally bring disorder and dishonor\u201d to the House. Tennessee Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison told CNN that the caucus believed the issue did not need to be considered by an ethics committee and accused Jones and Pearson of having a \u201chistory\u201d of disrupting floor proceedings. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible for us to move forward with the way they were behaving in committee and on the House floor,\u201d Faison said. The chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party, Hendrell Remus, called the move a \u201cdirect political attack\u201d on the party. \u201cTheir expulsion sets a dangerous new precedent for political retribution,\u201d a statement from the party said. \u201cThe day that a majority can simply expel a member of the opposing party without legitimate cause threatens the fabric of democracy in our state and creates a reckless roadmap for GOP controlled state legislatures across the nation.\u201d Historically, the Tennessee House had only expelled two other representatives since the Reconstruction, and the move requires a two-thirds majority vote of total members. The expulsions have been criticized by Democratic politicians and civil liberties groups who say voters in Jones\u2019 and Pearson\u2019s districts have been disenfranchised. Others, including Jones, have said the move distracts from the real problem of gun violence. \u201cRather than address the issue of banning assault weapons, my former colleagues \u2013 a Republican supermajority \u2013 are assaulting democracy,\u201d Jones told CNN. \u201cAnd that should scare all of us across the nation.\u201d Rep. Sam McKenzie, chair of the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, said the expulsion of Jones and Pearson overshadowed the issue they were protesting. \u201cThis was not about that kangaroo court that happened yesterday. This was about those three young children and those three guardians, those three adults, whose lives were taken away senselessly,\u201d McKenzie said. \u201cThe world saw what happened yesterday,\u201d McKenzie added, condemning the actions of House GOP leaders. \u201cThey ought to be ashamed of themselves.\u201d The NAACP also condemned the expulsions, calling them \u201chorrific\u201d but \u201cnot surprising.\u201d \u201cIt is inexcusable that, while (Jones and Pearson) upheld their oath to serve Tennesseans who are grieving the loss of last week\u2019s mass murder, their colleagues decided to use racial tropes to divert attention from their failure to protect the people they are supposed to serve,\u201d NAACP President & CEO Derrick Johnson said in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to stand with these champions of democracy, and are prepared to take whatever legal action is necessary to ensure that this heinous attempt to silence the voice of the people is addressed in a court of law,\u201d Johnson added. On \u201cCNN This Morning,\u201d Jones said, \u201cI think what happened was a travesty of democracy because they expelled the two youngest Black lawmakers \u2013 which is no coincidence \u2013 from the Tennessee state legislature because we are outspoken, because we fight for our district.\u201d Jones described the session as a \u201ctoxic, racist work environment,\u201d and said he spoke out because the House speaker ruled him out of order when he brought up the issue of gun violence. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t know this happened to me, I would think that this was 1963 instead of 2023,\u201d he added. Prior to the vote, Pearson publicly shared a letter he sent to House members in which he said he took accountability for \u201cnot following decorum\u201d on the House floor but defended his actions. Following their removal, pictures and profiles of Pearson and Jones have been pulled from the Tennessee General Assembly\u2019s website and their districts have been listed as vacant. Rep. Justin Pearson:    According to the Tennessee Constitution, since there is more than twelve months until the next general election in November 2024, a special election will be held to fill the seats. Tennessee law allows for the appointment of interim House members to fill the seats of expelled lawmakers until an election is held by local legislative bodies. In Jones\u2019 case, the local legislative body is the Metropolitan Council of Davidson County in Nashville. The council has scheduled a special meeting Monday afternoon to address the vacancy of the District 52 seat and possibly vote on an interim successor. For Pearson\u2019s District 86 seat, the local legislative body is the Shelby County Board of Commissioners in Memphis. It is unclear if or when a special meeting might be called there. According to Johnson, Jones and Pearson could be reappointed to their seats. \u201cI think we might have these two young men back very soon,\u201d Johnson said Thursday. \u201cIt is my promise to fight like hell to get both of them back.\u201d Pearson said he hopes to \u201cget reappointed to serve in the state legislature by the Shelby County Commissioners, and a lot of them, I know, are upset about the anti-democratic behavior of this White supremacist-led state legislature.\u201d Speaking to a crowd following their expulsion, Pearson and Jones insisted they would persist in advocating for gun control measures and encouraged protesters to continue showing up to the Capitol. The House has only expelled two state representatives in the last 157 years. The first expulsion, in 1980, was of a representative found guilty of accepting a bribe while in office, and the most recent came in 2016 when another member was expelled over allegations of sexual harassment. Democratic Rep. Joe Towns called the move a \u201cnuclear option.\u201d \u201cYou never use a sledgehammer to kill a gnat,\u201d Towns said. \u201cWe should not go to the extreme of expelling our members for fighting for what many of the citizens want to happen, whether you agree with it or not.\u201d The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee, Kathy Sinback, called the move in a statement a \u201ctargeted expulsion of two Black legislators without due process.\u201d She continued, \u201cIt raises questions about the disparate treatment of Black representatives, while continuing the shameful legacy of disenfranchising and silencing the voices of marginalized communities and the Black lawmakers they elect.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dakin Andone, Ryan Young, Amy Simonson, Arlette Saenz, Dianne Gallagher, Rebekah Riess, Sara Smart, Alta Spells, Jasmine Wright and Steve Almasy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A suburban Alabama community is rallying behind a Black author after the school district rescinded an invitation to have him speak and read his books at local elementary schools during Black History Month. Award-winning children\u2019s book author Derrick Barnes, known for writing stories for and featuring Black children, will no longer be visiting three Hoover City Schools, a school system just south of Birmingham, Alabama area this week. Dee Fowler, the district superintendent, cited contract issues and a parent\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d regarding Barnes\u2019 social media posts, he told CNN. The cancellation incited outrage from frustrated parents, teachers, and Hoover residents, some of whom channeled anger into activism. Hundreds have come together to raise a portion of the $9,900 Barnes would have been paid for the events. Some are also working to stock his books in Free Little Libraries, public bookcases where anyone can take or leave a book, throughout the city. Ashley Dorough, a parent of a 7-year-old student at one of the schools where the event was canceled, launched a fundraiser Wednesday, a week after the announcement. So far, $4,300 has been donated, covering Barnes\u2019 promised payment at one of the schools. The rest of the money will be donated to an organization aimed at stopping the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d by increasing literacy rates in children of color. \u201cWe are a transracial family, so when we found out Derrick Barnes was coming, we immediately cleared our schedule, asked the librarian if family can come, it was a very exciting, well-known event. It\u2019s a rare opportunity for your child to get in a public school, so losing that was disappointing, hurtful, and frustrating,\u201d Dorough, whose son is Black, told CNN. Dorough said she and others decided to take action. \u201cAt the beginning, there was so much anger, and we were all asking, \u2018Why, why, why?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI realized we can no longer be angry or just move on with our lives We had to take that energy and put it into something good.\u201d The district\u2019s move to cancel Barnes\u2019 visits triggered concerns of censorship amid controversial book bans in some parts of the country, specifically targeting titles related to diversity, equity and inclusion. Republican-led states, including Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas, have pushed statewide rules making it easier for critics to remove titles they dislike from school libraries. In Alabama, the state\u2019s board of education adopted a resolution in 2021 titled \u201cDeclaring the Preservation of Intellectual Freedom and Non-Discrimination in Alabama\u2019s Public Schools,\u201d which, according to the Legal Defense Fund, \u201cprevents educators from teaching the full and accurate history of racial discrimination and civil rights in Alabama and the United States.\u201d Florida school district begins 'cataloging' books to comply with DeSantis-backed law However, Fowler, the school district superintendent, told CNN the issue is not about the content of Barnes\u2019 books, which Fowler said are found in libraries and classrooms across the district, but posts he had made on social media. Fowler said the events were canceled after \u201ca parent at one of the elementary schools voiced concern regarding social media posts made by Mr. Barnes.\u201d He did not clarify what the posts included or what made them controversial. \u201cI wasn\u2019t told anything about a parental complaint. My socials are all about my books, events, children, and of course I talk about Black history facts and things happening in the world, but everything is factual,\u201d Barnes said. A CNN review of the author\u2019s social media posts found they predominantly feature photos of his family, writing, and music he enjoys, as well as comments about news events and political issues including police brutality, the January 6 insurrection and the presidential election. \u201cThat concern was relayed to our central office. Central office staff looked for the contract with Mr. Barnes to ascertain the nature and scope of his presentation, only to discover that no contract was on file,\u201d Fowler added. \u201cBecause of the difficulties encountered in attempting to reach a timely contractual arrangement with Mr. Barnes, we felt it appropriate to seek out other African American authors to speak at the schools.\u201d Fowler said the schools asked Barnes\u2019 agent, Patrick Oliver, for a contract three times, something Oliver told CNN was false. \u201cThe contract statement is an excuse the Hoover School District wants to hide behind for their horrible and unpopular decision,\u201d Oliver said, adding he made sure all necessary paperwork were completed. \u201cSeveral emails confirmed Derrick\u2019s appearance. I requested a $500 advance for Derrick\u2019s travel and the check was received within seven days, a sign that an agreement was in place for Derrick\u2019s appearance.\u201d The district informed Barnes\u2019 in an email, which was obtained by CNN, they would no longer host him as a guest author at the three schools due to \u201ca recent change.\u201d Parents were also sent a letter citing contractual issues as the reason for the cancellations and said the district would be paying Barnes a portion of his engagement fee. Barnes also had plans to make an appearance at the city\u2019s public library this week but canceled because of his family\u2019s concerns for his safety. When Barnes was a child, he never saw himself depicted in literature as anything but a stereotype; the runaway slave, the basketball player, the poor child living in the projects. Now a 47-year-old father of four boys, Barnes has dedicated his life to making sure every Black child can pick up a book and finally see their story filling its pages. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Black artist in America, by default you\u2019re an activist. I have an obligation to make sure if they can\u2019t find images that portray them as human beings, I will make sure to do it myself,\u201d Barnes told CNN. \u201cI write my books so when Black children pick them up they don\u2019t want to put it down because they see themselves. It\u2019s a mirror. They see it and think \u2018This is who I am, I\u2019m someone with astronomical goals. I love myself. I love my skin. I love my hair. I love my family. I love my neighborhood.\u2019\u201d Some of Barnes\u2019 most celebrated books, which focus on the beauty and joy of Black childhood, include \u201cCrown: An Ode to the Fresh Cut,\u201d which chronicles the experience of going to the barber, and \u201cI Am Every Good Thing,\u201d which encourages Black children to be proud of everything that makes them who they are. Some of his other books touch on topics like protesting racial injustice, a Black girl\u2019s first day of kindergarten, and a series centered around the 8-year-old \u201cultra-fabulous Ruby Marigold Booker.\u201d Barnes\u2019 felt \u201cdeeply offended and hurt by the cancellations,\u201d but more than anything, he says, he felt sadness for the children who missed out on an experience which could have had an enormous impact on their lives and futures. \u201cYou see in their eyes how much it means to them. When they meet me, a Black man, an author, and see I\u2019m not an entertainer, an athlete, or a rapper. They see what else they can be besides the stereotypes that are starting to seep into their psyche,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes my heart feel good seeing kids excited when I visit them because they know I\u2019m doing this work for them. They may not say it in so many words, but they know when I create books like that, I\u2019m speaking directly to them. I care about them and I want them to be presented in this world as full, thought out human beings.\u201d But his work isn\u2019t only for Black children, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s even more important for White children to see Black, Brown, Asian, Muslim characters. If they don\u2019t see those kids in their immediate environments, these books serve to counter stereotypes they\u2019re taught,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cThey get to learn about different cultures while also seeing the similarities, how we live, how we dream, the things we all fear, the things that bring us joy. But they won\u2019t realize this if they only see themselves.\u201d Prioritizing diversity in literature is a critical step to ensuring a community builds unity, according to Devon Frazier, whose organization I See Me will receive a portion of the money donated. \u201cWe develop ideas about ourselves and the world at an early age through literature. When children are presented with books that provide both \u2018mirrors\u2019 and \u2018windows,\u2019 it allows them to build empathy and have a deeper understanding for one another,\u201d she said. \u201cSubsequently, we can begin to drive out hate and misjudgments, replacing it with love and understanding.\u201d Six miles away from Hoover, Kristen Berthiaume decided she wouldn\u2019t stay silent either. While none of her children attend the schools impacted by the cancellations, Berthiaume launched a \u201cDerrick Barnes Book Drive,\u201d which prompted dozens of people to purchase and donate books written by Barnes, to distribute to as many children in Hoover as possible. So far more than $1,200 was raised to buy Barnes\u2019 books, and many others have mailed his books directly to Berthiaume, so she can fill up 25 public community bookcases, funded by the nonprofit group Little Free Library, around the city with his stories, Berthiaume said. \u201cThe idea was to make sure that kids who missed the opportunity to see his work and hear him speak can have them for free,\u201d said Berthiaume, who runs the \u201cAntiracist Little Library,\u201d a free library with central characters of color. \u201cWe just wanted these books to be made widely accessible since the school system didn\u2019t. I feel most disappointed for kids, especially those who have never met a Black male author before. It\u2019s really a huge loss we\u2019re talking about.\u201d An Alabama family started an antiracist library to promote racial justice and the importance of diversity in reading Teachers within the school district also took a stance, with 140 educators across Hoover elementary and high schools signing a letter to district leaders stating their concern and demanding \u201cforthrightness and transparency\u201d on why the visits were canceled. \u201cIn the absence of a clear and compelling explanation as to why such a decision was made, a reasonable person could infer from the information currently available that the decision was made for reasons other than those in the best interests of our students, possibly even in response to a single parent complaint.\u201d the letter, drafted by 11th grade teacher Reed Lochamy and 7th grade teacher Kent Haines, reads. Barnes says he feels overwhelming gratitude for the community\u2019s response: \u201cI can\u2019t say thank you enough,\u201d he said, adding he hopes the story will inspire people to pay attention to the censorship and banning of books in other states. \u201cAll of us who don\u2019t want this country to go backwards, banning books in a country all about diversity, every parent, celebrity, and person who is an advocate of literacy and truth and real American history needs to speak out so our voices remain louder than the opposition.\u201d Some residents in Hoover agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re not moving on from this, we\u2019ve been let down,\u201d Dorough said. \u201cBut there\u2019s more to the story besides the injustice, and that\u2019s our response. We will help support this author and an organization that wants to get diverse books into libraries that have no diversity, and now that is the point of our story.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This page has been retired and is no longer being updated. Here\u2019s a look at six generations of Americans in the 20th century: the Greatest Generation (or GI Generation), the Silent Generation, baby boomers, Generation X, millennials and Generation Z. In order to examine economic trends and social changes over time, demographers compare groupings of people bracketed by birth year. There are sometimes variations in the birth year that begins or ends a generation, depending on the source. The groupings below are based on studies by the US Census, Pew Research and demographers Neil Howe and William Strauss. Born in 1924 or earlier. Tom Brokaw coined the term the Greatest Generation as a tribute to Americans who lived through the Great Depression and then fought in WWII. His 1998 bestselling book, \u201cThe Greatest Generation,\u201d popularized the term. John F. Kennedy, born in 1917, was the first member of the Greatest Generation to become president. Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Ronald Reagan, Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush were also born between 1901 and 1924. Born 1925-1945 (Sometimes listed as 1925-1942). A 1951 essay in Time magazine dubbed the people in this age group the \u201cSilent Generation\u201d because they were more cautious than their parents. \u201cBy comparison with the \u2018Flaming Youth\u2019 of their fathers & mothers, today\u2019s younger generation is a still, small flame.\u201d The Silent Generation helped shape 20th century pop culture, with pioneering rock musicians, iconic filmmakers, television legends, beat poets, gonzo journalists and groundbreaking political satirists. President Joe Biden is the first member of the silent generation to serve as president. Born 1946-1964 (Sometimes listed as 1943-1964) Baby boomers were named for an uptick in the post-WWII birth rate. At the end of 1946, the first year of the baby boom, there were approximately 2.4 million baby boomers. In 1964, the last year of the baby boom, there were nearly 72.5 million baby boomers. The population peaked in 1999, with 78.8 million baby boomers, including people who immigrated to the United States and were born between 1946 and 1964. Bill Clinton was the first baby boomer to serve as president. George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump are also baby boomers. According to the Census, the baby boom began in 1946 but Howe and Strauss, authors of the groundbreaking 1991 book, \u201cGenerations: The History of America\u2019s Future,\u201d argued that the baby boom began as a social and cultural phenomenon with people who were born in 1943. Born 1965-1980 (Sometimes listed as 1965-1979) \u201cClass X\u201d was the name of a chapter in a 1983 book, \u201cClass: A Guide Through the American Status System,\u201d by historian Paul Fussell. Novelist Douglas Coupland used the term as the title of his first book, \u201cGeneration X: Tales for An Accelerated Culture,\u201d published in 1991. No members of Generation X have served as president. Although about 75% of people in this group earn more than baby boomers did when they were the same age, only 36% have more wealth than their parents, due to debt, according to a 2014 Pew report. In the 2016 presidential election, Generation X-ers and millennials made up more than half of the electorate, according to Pew. For the first time in decades, younger voters outnumbered older voters, albeit by a slight margin. Millennials and Generation-X-ers (age 18-51), cast 69.6 million votes, compared with 67.9 million votes cast by Baby Boomers and older voters (age 52 and up). Pew Research projects that in 2028, Generation X-ers will outnumber baby boomers. Born 1981-1996 (Sometimes listed as 1980-2000) Howe and Strauss introduced the term millennials in 1991, the year their book, \u201cGenerations,\u201d was published. In 2014, the number of millennials in the United States eclipsed the number of baby boomers, according to the Census Bureau. The Census counted approximately 83.1 million millennials, compared with 75.4 million baby boomers. Millennials represented one quarter of the nation\u2019s population. The Census also reported that millennials are more diverse than previous generations, as 44.2% are part of a minority race or ethnic group. About 39% of millennials ages 25-37 have a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, a larger percentage than previous generations, according to Pew. Millennials with a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher had median annual earnings valued at $56,000 in 2018, about the same earnings as Generation X workers in 2001. Millennials without a college education had lower earnings that prior generations. About 46% of millennials ages 25-37 were married in 2018, a lower percentage than Generation X (57%), baby boomers (67%) and the Silent Generation (83%). About 15% of millennials age 25-37 lived at home with their parents as of 2018, according to Pew. Fewer members of older generations lived at home with their parents between the ages of 25-37. The rate for Generation-X was 9%. The rate for Baby Boomers and the Silent Generation was 8%. Education factors into the percentage of millennials living at home. Among millennials without college degrees, 20% lived at home with their parents. 2016 was the first year any millennial was eligible to run for president (the minimum age is 35). Born 1997- no endpoint has been set In January 2019, Pew announced that the post-millennial cohort will be called Generation Z. According to Pew, Gen Z is the most racially and ethnically diverse cohort. One in four members of Gen Z are Hispanic while 52% are non-Hispanic white and 14% are black. A total of 6% are Asian and the remaining 4% are of another racial identity, primarily two or more races. The majority of individuals in Gen Z live in metropolitan areas and western states, with just 13% residing in rural areas. High school completion and college enrollment rates for Gen Z are up, with significant increases for young adults who are Hispanic or African-American, according to Pew. In 2017, 64% of Gen Z women aged 18-20 were enrolled in college, an increase over millennials (57%) and Generation X (43%).",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Sloppy presidents saving things for posterity. A secretary of state getting government data forwarded to her private email server. Ideologically motivated leakers Edward Snowden, Chelsea Manning and Reality Winner. Now, maybe a 21-year-old airman in the Massachusetts Air National Guard, a cyber transport systems specialist, apparently showing off to his teenage gaming buddies online. If the many earlier and ongoing scandals regarding classified information aren\u2019t a wakeup call that the US government has a problem, maybe the arrest of Jack Teixeira will do the trick. Wearing a t-shirt, athletic shorts, dark socks and boots, Teixeira surrendered to a heavily armed FBI SWAT team outside his mother\u2019s home on Thursday, as news helicopters hovered overhead. Stunning leak arrest spotlights major ongoing US intelligence vulnerabilities He\u2019s suspected of leaking classified data that has sent the US intelligence community scrambling, strained relations with foreign governments and jeopardized the valuable line of information that has given Americans insight into Russia\u2019s moves in Ukraine. But the profile of the suspected leaker that is emerging, and which undoubtedly could change quite a bit as we learn more, is not of a foreign spy or an ideologically motivated whistleblower \u2013 but rather, the ringleader of a gaming chatgroup who wanted to impress the teenagers he\u2019d met online during the pandemic. Those details are from an incredible report in The Washington Post, which published an anonymous interview with a member of the closed group of about two dozen people on the platform Discord, where images of the classified material first appeared. \u25ba Why did Teixeira have access to some of the country\u2019s most sensitive secrets that were apparently prepared for the Defense Department\u2019s most senior uniformed leadership? \u25ba How were photographs of classified data able to be posted to a chatgroup frequented by teenage gamers? \u25ba What justified high level security clearance for a young airman who, according to the young member the Post spoke with, griped about \u201cgovernment overreach\u201d and appeared in videos using racial epithets before firing a large weapon? \u25ba What motivated him? First, what did Teixeira do as a cyber transport systems specialist? That title \u201cis the Air Force recruiter\u2019s way of describing an IT specialist role,\u201d said Christopher Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, during an appearance Thursday on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead\u201d with Jake Tapper. \u201cSo, these are the folks that design, that deploy the computer systems networks and then maintain them.\u201d That can include IT systems in both the unclassified and classified space, Krebs said, noting that classified material is usually viewed in an area known as a \u201cSensitive compartmented information facility,\u201d or SCIF, on a military installation. How might Teixeira have gotten images of these classified materials? Guessing, Krebs said it is possible Teixeira could have come across some of the classified material that had been discarded, potentially in a burn bag, from a previous briefing. Those details will have to be learned. One thing that should be abundantly clear from the string of leaks and improperly handled pieces of classified information beyond this story is that the system has problems. There are special counsels actively investigating both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump for potentially mishandling classified materials found at their homes. In Biden\u2019s case, those documents were from his time as vice president, while the documents at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort were found after he left the White House. The New York Times reported Wednesday that witnesses questioned as part of the Trump investigation have been asked if he was showing off a map with sensitive intelligence information. Those investigations follow the email server that dogged former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016 and the leaks by former National Security Agency subcontrator turned Russian Edward Snowden, who leaked documents about a massive US government surveillance program; the former US Army soldier now known as Chelsea Manning, who leaked information about US military conduct in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the former NSA translator Reality Winner, who leaked a report about Russian election meddling in the US. \u201cThey continue to lock down the systems over time after they learn from each new vulnerability,\u201d CNN correspondent Josh Campbell, who covers national security and law enforcement, said on Thursday. Campbell, a former FBI supervisory special agent, also noted the military has come under some scrutiny because, while it employs the largest number of people with security clearances, it does not subject them to the same rigorous reauthorization as other agencies, which routinely require people to go \u201con the box,\u201d Campbell said, and pass a polygraph. The Pentagon documents leaks should not cause alarm, President Joe Biden said during an appearance in Ireland Thursday. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the leak,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI\u2019m concerned that it happened, but there\u2019s nothing contemporaneous that I\u2019m aware of that is of any consequence.\u201d Already, after these most recent leaks, there have been changes at the Pentagon. CNN reported Thursday that some US officials who used to receive the briefing materials daily have stopped receiving them in recent days. Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut said these repeated problems will have an affect on US allies. \u201cI would forgive the South Koreans or the Israelis or the French or whoever from saying we may not be able to share our most sensitive information with the Americans because they can\u2019t seem to keep it out of 21-year-olds\u2019 hands or ex-presidents\u2019 garages or people named Reality Winner or whatever,\u201d he told Tapper. As What Matters first reported last August, when classified documents were found by the FBI at Mar-a-Lago, it\u2019s actually a very large universe of people with access to Top Secret data. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence publishes what is described as an annual report, \u201cSecurity Clearance Determinations,\u201d although the most recent one I could find was from fiscal year 2017. In it, more than 2.8 million people are described as having security clearance as of October 2017 \u2013 more than 1.6 million with access to either Confidential or Secret information and nearly 1.2 million with access to Top Secret information. There are additional people who have security clearance but don\u2019t currently have access to information. This includes civilian employees, contractors and members of the military. The Pentagon spokesman, Air Force Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder, compared the method by which classified information is stored to a locked house where people with clearance can get a key. Abusing that clearance, Ryder said, is a \u201ca deliberate criminal act.\u201d David Priess, the former CIA intelligence briefer, carried on the keys analogy as he tried to explain the need for accountability here. \u201cThe idea is, you give people the keys to the rooms in the house where they need to access that information,\u201d Priess said on CNN Thursday. \u201cThere are going to be legitimate questions about how many keys did this individual have? How many rooms was he allowed to go into to take things out of as part of his job? And did he really need that as part of his job?\u201d Campbell said it\u2019s important not to assume Teixeira\u2019s young age should be a factor. \u201cI can tell you firsthand that there are young people in the military that do incredible work in the intelligence field around the world,\u201d Campbell said. But at the top levels of government there is already acknowledgment that the system needs to change. The Biden administration has considered updating regulations to cut down on how much information is classified. CIA Director Bill Burns said Tuesday, while speaking at an event at Rice University in Texas, that he believes there is a \u201cserious problem of over-classification\u201d in the US government and that lessons also need to be learned from this latest leak. \u201cAre there things we need to do better? Of course,\u201d Burns said. \u201cI think there is a serious problem of over classification sometimes in the US government .. which I think needs to be taken on.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Yet another mass shooting and a new blow to nationwide abortion rights left Republicans facing pointed questions on two of the most emotive issues dominating American politics. But the GOP had almost nothing to say, reflecting the way that it is locked into positions that animate its most fervent grassroots voters but risk alienating it from much of the public. A controversial ruling from a conservative judge in Texas that could halt the use of a popular abortion drug nationwide, and another shooting spree \u2013 this time in Kentucky \u2013 sparked outrage among Democrats and calls for strengthening gun safety measures and protecting abortion rights. Most Republicans stayed silent on the two issues on which they have achieved their political and policy goals but that are threatening the party\u2019s long-term viability. After the shooting in downtown Louisville on Monday, Kentucky\u2019s Republican senators issued condolences but offered no solutions about how the tragedy, which killed five people and injured eight others, might have been avoided. The gunman used a rifle in the attack after being notified of his impending dismissal from a job at a bank, a law enforcement official said. \u201cWe send our prayers to the victims, their families, and the city of Louisville as we await more information,\u201d Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell wrote in a tweet that also praised first responders. And Sen. Rand Paul tweeted that he and his wife were \u201cpraying for everyone involved in the deadly shooting,\u201d adding that \u201cour hearts break for the families of those lost.\u201d Democrats offered condolences too, but also had a more practical response. President Joe Biden called for the kind of gun safety reform that is impossible with Republicans in control of the House of Representatives and without Democrats holding more seats in the Senate. \u201cToo many Americans are paying for the price of inaction with their lives. When will Republicans in Congress act to protect our communities?\u201d Biden asked in a tweet. Democratic Rep. Morgan McGarvey, who represents Louisville in Congress, called for action to tackle gun violence. \u201cThoughts and prayers for those we lost, those who are injured and their loved ones and families are appreciated, but today serves as a stark reminder that we need to address gun violence at the national level,\u201d the freshman congressman said. Over the last few decades, Republicans have expertly used gun rights and a push to overturn a constitutional right to end a pregnancy to energize their most loyal voters. And on each issue, in a purely political sense, it\u2019s hard to argue that they have not racked up considerable wins. There are more guns than ever in the US. Republicans around the country are leading efforts to slash firearms regulation and broaden citizens\u2019 capacity to carry guns. Despite a murderous run of massacres in schools, nightclubs, places of worship and, on Monday, in a bank, the party has effectively closed down all significant attempts in Congress to make it harder to buy weapons \u2013 including the assault-style rifles used in recent shootings. A bipartisan effort to persuade states to embrace red flag laws, which could help authorities confiscate weapons from people thought to pose a risk, did pass Congress last year. But its success was all the more notable because of the paucity of other federal legislation in previous decades. On abortion, meanwhile, the 50-year conservative campaign to overturn Roe v. Wade ranks as one of the most stunning victories for a long-term political movement in history. It reached its apex with the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade last year. Yet it\u2019s possible that these famous wins could carry a significant risk for the party. South Carolina Republican Rep. Nancy Mace calls herself \u201cpro-life,\u201d but also warns that GOP-backed state laws that don\u2019t provide exceptions for rape, incest or the health of the mother alienate large and vital sections of the US electorate. Mace was a rare Republican to publicly respond to Texas Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk\u2019s abortion drug ruling last week, which Democratic groups have seized on to renew claims Republicans want a national ban on abortion. \u201cWe are getting it wrong on this issue,\u201d Mace said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to show compassion to women, especially to women who\u2019ve been raped. We\u2019ve got to show compassion on the abortion issue, because by and large, most of Americans aren\u2019t with us on this issue.\u201d She called for the US Food and Drug Administration to ignore the judge\u2019s ruling, aligning her with progressive Democrats like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. One reason Republicans have been successful in tightening abortion restrictions and loosening those on guns has been that their voters have embraced these two issues. They are make-or-break for many activists, and candidates have shaped their platforms as a result. Democrats, however, have traditionally been less successful in energizing their core supporters on both. The disparate intensity level among the parties was one factor in the sequence of events that led to a new conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned Roe. For years, Democrats trod carefully around the guns issue, wary of alienating more moderate or soft conservative voters. But there are signs this could be changing. Abortion was a huge motivator for Democratic voters in last year\u2019s midterms and the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling clearly hamstrung Republican candidates in several key swing races. In Wisconsin, which reverted to a pre-Civil War law banning almost all abortions once Roe was overturned, the issue was critical to the victory of a liberal candidate in last week\u2019s state Supreme Court race, which flipped the conservative majority. Liberal fury over the failure to enact new gun laws stoked a political storm in Tennessee last week. Republicans expelled two Black Democratic lawmakers from the state\u2019s House of Representatives for leading a gun reform protest inside the chamber after a mass shooting at a Nashville school the week before that killed six people, including three nine-year-olds. This highlighted a growing frustration among Democrats at their impotence in the face of endless mass shootings. (One of the lawmakers, Justin Jones, was sworn back into the chamber on Monday on an interim basis after the Nashville Metropolitan Council voted to appoint him.) Democrats push abortion rights to the ballot in 2024, using an old GOP playbook Despite this shifting political terrain, there are few signs that top Republican leaders are willing to change the party\u2019s tack on guns or abortion. Or that they have the political room to do so. Even though it makes sense for Republicans to appeal to a more general audience to avoid alienating crucial suburban, moderate and female voters, the vehemence of their core supporters makes this an impossible straddle. It\u2019s a similar dynamic to the one many GOP power brokers have long faced with Donald Trump. The former president remains so popular with base voters that his GOP critics risk their careers by publicly opposing him. And yet, he has long been a liability among general election voters \u2013 as proved by the GOP\u2019s performance in 2020 and 2022. The party\u2019s failure to align with most Americans on abortion and on some aspects of gun safety may not be sustainable. Polls show that many voters, including younger Americans, are being driven away from the party because of its positions. In a Harvard Youth Poll released last week, which was completed before the shooting in Nashville, 63% of 18-to-29-year-olds said that gun laws should be made more strict, with 22% saying they should be kept as they are, and 13% that they should be made less strict. Young Americans are generally on the same page as the public as a whole. In October 2022, 57% of all Americans said that laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict, with 32% saying laws should be kept as they were and 10% that laws should be made less strict, according to a Gallup survey from October 2022. On abortion, only 26% of Americans favor laws making it illegal to use or receive through the mail FDA-approved drugs for a medical abortion, while 72% oppose such laws, according to a PRRI report that analyzed polling on the issue over the last year. While 50% of White evangelical Protestants favor making it illegal to use or receive those drugs, less than half of any other racial, gender, educational or age group agree. In a Gallup poll in January, 46% of Americans said they were dissatisfied with US abortion policies and would prefer to see less strict abortion laws. That\u2019s a record high in the firm\u2019s 23-year trend, up from 30% in January 2022 and just 17% in 2021. Given these numbers, and recent election results, it\u2019s not surprising that some Republicans not actively courting the base may choose not to speak at length on guns and abortion. And such data may also help to explain the GOP\u2019s increasingly anti-democratic turn as it seeks to cling onto power \u2013 whether in efforts to expel Tennessee lawmakers for disturbing decorum with their anti-gun protests or through Trump\u2019s insistence he won an election he actually lost.",

            "article_content": "Even amid all his legal challenges, Donald Trump has a secret weapon in his drive to win the Republican presidential nomination next year: polling strongly suggests he has transformed the GOP primary electorate in a way that will make him harder to beat. Since Trump\u2019s emergence as the GOP\u2019s dominant figure in 2016, the college-educated voters generally most skeptical of him have declined as a share of all GOP primary voters, while the voters without a college degree generally most sympathetic to him have increased, an array of public and private polls indicate. Those changes suggest Trump has set in motion what could prove a self-fulfilling prophecy: compared to when he first captured the nomination in 2016, he\u2019s encouraged more participation in the Republican primaries by the blue-collar voters most inclined to support him and less by the white-collar voters likely to become the centerpiece of any coalition against him. \u201cThere\u2019s no question about it,\u201d says long-time GOP pollster Whit Ayres. \u201cHe has drawn people into the Republican Party who are more likely to support him and people like him and he has driven out of the Republican Party people who were more likely to support candidates George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney.\u201d This transformation of the Republican electorate is critical because attitudes in the GOP about Trump vary enormously along educational lines \u2013 what political analysts have often termed the divide between well-educated \u201cwine track\u201d and non-college educated \u201cbeer track\u201d voters. In the latest CNN national poll conducted by SRSS, for instance, almost three-fifths of Republicans without a four-year college degree said nominating Trump again would give the party its best chance of winning in 2024; in stark contrast, two-thirds of Republicans with a college degree said the party would have a better chance if it chose someone else. The conundrum for Republicans is that while the influence of college-educated adults is diminishing inside the GOP primary, those voters have become a growing obstacle for the party in general elections. The rejection of Trump, and Trump-style candidates, in well-educated suburbs across the country has been a central factor in the mostly disappointing election results for the GOP in 2018, 2020 and 2022. The Democratic landslide in last week\u2019s state Supreme Court election in Wisconsin, a state the GOP likely must win back to recapture the White House next year, underlined the party\u2019s continuing erosion in such places, especially amid the sharpening debate over abortion rights. The changing nature of the GOP coalition compounds the party\u2019s problems of winning back those suburban voters. The shift toward a more blue-collar primary electorate advantages the candidates like Trump emphasizing precisely the slashing culture war messages that are alienating those general election voters. Probably the best long-term data set capturing the shifting dimensions of the Republican electoral coalition is polling by the GOP firm Public Opinion Strategies. Each year, it cumulates the results of all the polls it conducts for media clients including the Wall Street Journal, NBC and CNBC to produce a large-sample picture of the two parties\u2019 supporters. This annual merged data shows some significant changes over the past decade among the voters who identify with the GOP, according to a detailed breakdown the firm provided to me. In the POS data, the party is getting somewhat grayer: in 2012 it found that 43% of all Republicans were aged 55 or older. That figure rose to 50% in 2022, the latest annual compilation. Over that same period, the party moved modestly to the right, with the share of GOP voters who identify as very conservative edging up from 34% in 2012 to 38% in 2022. On other key dimensions, the party didn\u2019t change much: in 2022, as in 2012, men constituted a slight majority of all GOP partisans (a stark contrast from the electorate overall, where women are the majority), and voters of color represented about one-in-eight party members, virtually unchanged from 10 years ago. But one change in the GOP electorate was more dramatic than any other, says GOP pollster Bill McInturff, one of the firm\u2019s partners: \u201cthe growth of non-college Whites as a percentage of self-identified Republicans.\u201d In 2012, the firm found, those Whites without a college degree constituted 48% of all Republicans, only slightly more than Whites with a college degree, who represented 40%. By 2016, when Trump was first nominated, the gap between the two groups had widened, with the non-college Whites rising to 56% of all Republicans, and the college-educated Whites falling to 33%. In the 2022 results, the Whites without a college degree soared to 62% of all GOP partisans, while the college-educated Whites sagged to 25%. (Looking at all GOP supporters, including the relatively small number who are racial minorities, the group without a college degree rose from 56% in 2012 to 70% in 2022, POS found.) What makes this shift even more striking is that over that same period, Whites without a college degree have generally declined as a share of the total electorate by about two percentage points every four years, according to figures from the Census Bureau and other data sources such as the projections by the Democratic targeting firm Catalist. That means the non-college Whites have been increasing their presence inside the GOP while they were shrinking overall, as American society grows both more racially diverse and better educated. Not every data source shows as dramatic a change as POS. Large-sample polls provided to CNN by the Public Religion Research Institute found virtually no change in the educational composition of GOP partisans from 2016 to 2022. Similarly, long-time GOP pollster Chris Wilson said in an email that while he believes the GOP electorate has tilted more toward voters without a college degree over the past decade, most of that change occurred by 2016, with little additional movement since. \u201cOne way to look at the data overall is that the effect Trump had in the primary was already baked into 2016,\u201d he said. But other sources point toward continuing change. In addition to the Public Opinion Strategies data, the Pew Research Institute also found that over the decade of the 2010s, college-educated Whites shrank as a share of GOP voters, widening the gap with Whites who lack a degree (who remained constant at just under three-fifths of the party). Using a new polling methodology for its latest figures, Pew found that voters of all races without a college degree now comprise fully 68% of Republicans, almost exactly the same result as POS. Whatever their exact share in the total pool of GOP supporters, college-educated voters will likely represent a somewhat larger portion of actual voters in next year\u2019s primaries. That\u2019s because eligible voters with a college degree consistently turn out at higher rates than those without one. Cumulative analyses by Gary Langer of ABC of all the exit polls conducted in the Republican presidential primaries of 2008, 2012 and 2016 found that each time the total GOP primary electorate split almost exactly in half between voters with and without a college degree. But subsequent changes in the methodology of the exit polls suggest those numbers likely somewhat inflated the share of college-educated GOP voters. Many recent media and GOP polls have found that Republicans without a degree now comprise a clear majority of Republicans likely to vote in next year\u2019s primary. The latest CNN polls, for instance, project that voters with a college degree will comprise about one-third of the likely 2024 GOP voters, while those without a degree will constitute two-thirds. The most recent Monmouth University poll found an even greater imbalance, projecting that fully 72% of GOP primary voters next year will lack a college degree. Three Republican pollsters I spoke with \u2013 Ayres, McInturff and CNN contributor Kristen Soltis Anderson \u2013 all said that their analysis projects college-educated voters will represent about 40% of the GOP electorate next year. That leaves the non-college voters who provide the bedrock of Trump\u2019s support as the clear majority at around 60%. State-level polls also document how the GOP electorate has shifted toward those without degrees. In New Hampshire, for instance, adults with a four-year college or graduate degree constituted a 54% majority of likely voters in a January 2016 poll just before the primary there by the University of New Hampshire, according to results provided to CNN. In a January 2023 UNH poll, college-educated voters had fallen in half, to just 27% of likely GOP primary voters, while those without degrees had soared to 73%. Likewise, in New York, Siena College polling has found that the share of likely GOP primary voters with a college degree in that state has fallen in half, from around 50% in 2016 to just 25% now. Polling over the same period by the Public Policy Institute of California shows a more modest shift in the same direction there. These shifts enormously complicate the task of assembling a coalition that can beat the former president in the primaries. Trump has gained ground in recent weeks among college- and non-college voters alike, particularly as the party has rallied around him in the face of his indictment by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. But there\u2019s no question that college-educated Republicans are much cooler toward Trump than their counterparts without a degree. In 2016, only about one-third of college-educated Republicans supported Trump in the primaries, according to Langer\u2019s cumulative analysis of the exit polls. And while 63% of non-college Republicans said in the latest CNN poll that the party should nominate Trump in 2024, only 33% of those with degrees agreed (suggesting his underlying support among them has not increased from its meager level in 2016). Anderson says that in polling over the past few months by her firm Echelon Insights, nearly half of all Republicans who express unfavorable views about Trump hold a college degree. That\u2019s true, she says, both for Republicans who identify as conservatives and those who do not. \u201cThe portions of the right that are not very favorable to Donald Trump are the most highly educated,\u201d she says. After eight years of Trump\u2019s seismic impact on the party, though, those highly educated Republicans have less leverage over the nomination process than they did in 2016. With the non-college Republicans now a growing majority of the primary electorate, it\u2019s unlikely that anybody can overtake Trump without significantly cutting into his lead among those blue-collar voters who gave him nearly half their total votes in 2016 and again are supporting him at least at that level in most 2024 polls. Long-time GOP consultant David Kochel is one of many party strategists who believes that \u201cIf you are going to have an anti-Trump coalition in the primary,\u201d college-educated Republicans are \u201cwhere it has to start.\u201d But since those voters likely won\u2019t be enough to beat Trump on their own, Trump\u2019s rivals will also need to loosen his hold on non-college Republicans. Yet doing that may require taking hardline positions on cultural issues that makes it more difficult to unite the college Republicans. Those two groups, Kochel says, \u201chave very different values, they see things differently, they live in very different media universes.\u201d Ron DeSantis\u2019 recent polling decline among college-educated Republicans may reflect that challenge. While he often led Trump among them earlier this year, the Florida governor has consistently slipped somewhat as he\u2019s leaned even harder into his culture warrior credentials, signing a bill allowing permit less carry of concealed weapons and backing a six-week abortion ban in Florida. (DeSantis also stumbled on Ukraine by initially echoing, and then somewhat distancing from, Trump\u2019s skepticism of sustained US support.) Wilson says it\u2019s possible college graduates could comprise a somewhat larger share of the GOP electorate in 2024 than 2016 if President Joe Biden does not face a competitive Democratic race and more white-collar independents choose to participate in Republican primaries as a result. But most other Republicans I spoke with believe the other candidates will face the challenge of beating Trump in an electorate tilted even more than in 2016 toward the voters most sympathetic to him. \u201cHe has created favorable conditions for himself,\u201d says Kochel. Kochel doesn\u2019t believe that dynamic guarantees a Trump victory, though. While Republicans of all camps, he says, mostly rally around Trump when he\u2019s criticized by Democrats or the news media, the former president could be more vulnerable to \u201ca sustained effort to define him negatively from the right\u201d on issues such as his support of steps to lock down the country in the very first days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Taking down Trump with those arguments won\u2019t be easy because the GOP voters theoretically most receptive to that case are largely the same non-college Republicans who display the strongest emotional connection to the former president as a \u201cwarrior\u201d who fights for them. Yet most GOP strategists agree Trump\u2019s 2024 rivals must find some way to reduce his commanding lead with the blue-collar Republicans. \u201cIf he stays that high,\u201d among those non-college primary voters, says Ayres, \u201cit is going to be very difficult to dislodge him.\u201d Unless one of Trump\u2019s opponents can disrupt these dynamics, the former president in 2024 may have even more reason to declare, as he so memorably did in 2016, that \u201cI love the poorly educated.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump may be getting all the headlines, but partisan struggles in state capitals across the country may do far more to change America than the drama surrounding the first ex-president to be charged with a crime. Clashes between Democrats and Republicans over issues like abortion and guns, which could also shape future voting laws and electoral maps, foreshadow the great debates to come in the 2024 presidential campaign. These simmering conflicts also reflect a nation divided over its cultural and political identity and show how sometimes small shifts in the balance of power can have momentous consequences. In Wisconsin \u2013 one of the most competitive swing states in recent presidential elections \u2013 a liberal judge won a race for a state Supreme Court seat Tuesday in a victory that could restore abortion rights in the state and lead to the redrawing of maps that the GOP had shaped to their advantage. The magnitude of her victory \u2013 by around 200,000 votes \u2013 will ring alarm bells for the GOP. In North Carolina, Republicans were celebrating after a Democratic state representative, who was elected by a nearly 20-point margin a few months ago, flipped to the GOP this week, giving the party veto-proof majorities in both state legislative chambers as they seek new curbs on abortion and more restrictive election laws. America\u2019s tortured divide on firearms is driving an extraordinary showdown in Tennessee. Instead of working to combat mass shootings after last week\u2019s massacre at a Nashville school, Republican state legislators want to kick out three Democrats who joined a gun control protest. National Democrats are, meanwhile, looking at Chicago, where Bernie Sanders-backed progressive Brandon Johnson won Tuesday\u2019s mayoral runoff. He beat a moderate with a tough-on-crime message by making a more nuanced pitch than his previous support for calls to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d (Johnson said during the campaign he didn\u2019t want to slash police funding.) And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who says his state is a laboratory for a more conservative America ahead of his possible White House bid, signed a bill into law earlier this week allowing people to carry concealed guns without a permit. The state Senate also passed a highly restrictive 6-week abortion ban Monday. This remarkable series of local battles is not always noticed in Washington, where lawmakers are gearing up for a looming debt ceiling crisis and arguing about aid to Ukraine. But political brushfires that begin in states can later rage at the national level and define future general election clashes. It\u2019s already clear, for example, that gender and transgender issues will be a dominant question in 2024, as Republicans slam Democrats for embracing policies that they describe as \u201cwoke.\u201d The intensity of exchanges on issues like abortion, gender and guns raises another possibility. For all of Trump\u2019s appeal to grassroots Republican voters, he is running a campaign that is almost exclusively rooted in his fury at his worsening legal problems and his claim that he is being politically persecuted to keep him out of the White House. The fights brewing in the states suggest many voters have other things on their minds. Wisconsin has reeled from a conservative revival and a subsequent liberal backlash ever since Republican Scott Walker was first elected governor in 2010. It was critical to the victories of Donald Trump in 2016 and Joe Biden in 2020 and remains on a political knife edge heading into a new presidential election cycle. Record number of anti-LGBTQ bills have been introduced this year In the latest political shift in the state, liberal judge Janet Protasiewicz easily beat conservative Daniel Kelly in a nonpartisan election where the parties nevertheless had clear favorites. The contest attracted significant outside spending, making it the most expensive state judicial race in history, and Protasiewicz\u2019s winning margin was about 10 times the size of Trump and Biden\u2019s respective cushions of around 20,000 votes. All elections are unique, but the Wisconsin judge\u2019s victory underscores the power of abortion as a mobilizing issue and may fuel concerns among GOP strategies that the issue could again hurt their candidates in 2024. The policy effects of abortion\u2019s galvanizing electoral force could be seen in another Midwestern battleground on Wednesday. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed a repeal of the state\u2019s 1931 abortion ban, which was possible because voters last fall handed Democrats control of both legislative chambers. Now with a liberal majority, the Wisconsin Supreme Court is expected to overturn a pre-Civil War law that bans abortion in nearly all circumstances, which came back into force after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Protasiewicz\u2019s win will be a beacon of hope for Democrats who were demoralized by the loss of federal abortion rights last year. Sean Eldridge \u2013 the founder and president of Stand Up America, a progressive advocacy group \u2013 said Protasiewicz would act as a check on \u201cconservative efforts to take away reproductive freedom, disenfranchise voters of color through racial gerrymandering, and overturn election results they don\u2019t like. Her victory helps build a firewall for our democracy and the freedom to vote ahead of 2024.\u201d But the lesson of Wisconsin\u2019s turbulent political decade is that local Republicans, some of whom are in thrall to Trumpism, are likely to fight back hard. Indeed, Tuesday\u2019s election also saw Republicans win an open state Senate seat, giving the GOP a supermajority that could be used to impeach top office holders, theoretically including Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. In an interview with WISN in Wisconsin last month, Dan Knodl \u2013 the Republican who won on Tuesday \u2013 said he would consider a move to impeach Protasiewicz. At the time, she was serving as a Milwaukee circuit court judge. It is not clear if the legislature could remove her from the Supreme Court. In another striking example of gaping political polarization, the GOP-led legislature in Tennessee is seeking the expulsion of three Democratic colleagues who led a rowdy protest on the state House floor after a mass killing of three nine-year-olds and three adults at a Christian school in Nashville. Speaker of the House Cameron Sexton described the protest as an unacceptable breach of decorum and the lawmakers have already been stripped of committee posts. The Republican speaker said the protest was \u201cat least equivalent, maybe worse,\u201d than the mob attack by Trump supporters on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Tennessee House Republicans take steps to remove Democratic lawmakers after they joined gun control protest One of the Democratic lawmakers, state Rep. Justin Pearson, explained on CNN that he supported the protest by gun reform advocates in the public gallery because he believed voices were not being heard as they demanded action on red flag laws and other gun safety measures. Polls show a majority of Americans are in favor of tighter gun restrictions, but support varies depending on the measure in question. Pearson told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that the trio knew they were breaking a House rule on decorum. \u201cBut we did not know and did not think we were doing anything that could get us expelled by exercising our First Amendment rights and encouraging those protesters and children and adults and grieving parents to do the same in the House.\u201d The drama in the state legislature in Nashville was matched by a remarkable twist in North Carolina this week when Democratic state Rep. Tricia Cotham switched to the GOP, saying, \u201cThe modern day Democratic Party has become unrecognizable to me.\u201d Cotham played into the Republican conceit that the rival party has gone so far left on cultural and economic issues that it has abandoned the American mainstream, although the GOP has been on its own march to the extremes. Cotham\u2019s move comes with fraught implications for Democrats because it gives the GOP sufficient votes in each chamber to override vetoes from Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. North Carolina Democrat switches parties giving Republicans veto-proof supermajority in state House Democrats accused Cotham of betraying her voters, and Cooper warned that her actions would have grave consequences. \u201cRep. Cotham\u2019s votes on women\u2019s reproductive freedom, election laws, LGBTQ rights and strong public schools will determine the direction of the state we love,\u201d Cooper told CNN in a statement. The blows, meanwhile, keep coming for Democrats in Florida where a thumping reelection win by DeSantis last November and Republican control of the state legislature add up to total conservative dominance. As he seeks to appeal to Republican grassroots voters ahead of a possible presidential run, DeSantis this week further loosened Florida\u2019s already permissive gun laws. And after he signed into law a 15-week abortion ban last year, the state Senate just passed a bill that would ban most abortions in the state after the gestational age of about six weeks \u2013 or about four weeks of pregnancy. The hardline abortion policy might allow DeSantis to solidify a message that he\u2019d be a more effective conservative leader than Trump. But it\u2019s also the kind of positioning that would offer Democrats an opening should be become the Republican nominee.",

            "article_content": "Alvin Bragg, a former New York state and federal prosecutor, drew national attention when he made history as the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office\u2019s first Black district attorney. Now, he is back in the spotlight after a grand jury voted to indict Donald Trump following a yearslong investigation into the former president\u2019s alleged role in a hush money scheme. The indictment was unsealed Tuesday as Trump was arraigned in a Manhattan criminal court, unveiling the 34 felony criminal charges of falsifying business records made against the former president. In Bragg\u2019s first comments following the arraignment, he called the charges the \u201cbread and butter\u201d of his office\u2019s work. \u201cAt its core, this case today is one with allegations like so many of our white collar cases,\u201d he said. Bragg inherited the probe from his predecessor, Cy Vance, who began the investigation when Trump was still in the White House. Trump, who pleaded not guilty to the charges, cast Bragg\u2019s case as political and called for his resignation in a speech Tuesday evening. \u201cI never thought anything like this could happen in America, never thought it could happen,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe only crime that I have committed is to fearlessly defend our nation from those who seek to destroy it.\u201d Donald Trump indicted by Manhattan grand jury In March, Trump announced on social media, ahead of any details from Bragg\u2019s office, that he anticipated he would be arrested within days in connection with the investigation. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office declined at the time to comment on the former president\u2019s remarks. The high-profile case relates to a $130,000 payment made by Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen to adult film star Stormy Daniels days before the 2016 presidential election in exchange for her silence about an alleged affair with Trump a decade prior. Trump has continuously denied having an affair with Daniels. The indictment is historic, marking the first time a former US president and major presidential candidate has ever been criminally charged. In the lead-up to Bragg\u2019s decision, sources told CNN that city, state and federal law enforcement agencies in New York City had been discussing how to prepare for a possible Trump indictment, with the former president having called on his supporters to protest if he were to be arrested. Discussions between the New York Police Department and the FBI also have focused on the possibility of increased threats against Bragg and his staff from Trump\u2019s supporters in wake of an indictment, sources told CNN. Bragg said in an email to staff earlier in March that his office will \u201cnot tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York.\u201d Bragg has aggressively pursued Trump and other progressive priorities so far in his tenure, including not prosecuting some low-level crimes and finding alternatives to incarceration. Before Bragg\u2019s swearing-in last year, he had already worked on cases related to Trump and other notable names in his role as a New York state chief deputy attorney general. He said he had helped sue the Trump administration more than 100 times, as well as led a team that sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which resulted in the former president paying $2 million to a number of charities and the foundation\u2019s dissolution. Bragg also led the suit against disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein and his company, which alleged a hostile work environment. The Harvard-educated attorney previously served as an assistant US attorney in the Southern District of New York, worked as a civil rights lawyer and as a professor and co-director of the New York Law School Racial Justice Project, where he represented family members of Eric Garner, who died in 2014 after being placed in an unauthorized chokehold by a then-police officer, in a lawsuit against the City of New York seeking information. Bragg emerged the winner in a crowded Democratic primary in the summer of 2021 to lead the coveted Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office, for which Vance had announced earlier that year he would not seek reelection. While campaigning, he often spoke about his experience growing up in Harlem, saying he was once a 15-year-old stopped \u201cnumerous times at gunpoint by police.\u201d \u201cIn addition to being the first Black district attorney, I think I\u2019ll probably be the first district attorney who\u2019s had police point a gun at him,\u201d he said during a victory speech, following his historic election to the office. \u201cI think I\u2019ll be the first district attorney who\u2019s had a homicide victim on his doorstop. I think I\u2019ll be the first district attorney in Manhattan who\u2019s had a semi-automatic weapon pointed at him. I think I\u2019ll be the first district attorney in Manhattan who\u2019s had a loved one reenter from incarceration and stay with him. And I\u2019m going to govern from that perspective.\u201d Bragg ran as a reformer, releasing a memo just days after taking office detailing new charging, bail, plea and sentencing policies \u2013 a plan that drew criticism from police union leaders. He said his office would not prosecute marijuana misdemeanors, fare evading and prostitution, among other crimes. This story has been updated with additional developments.

            "article_content": "Sixty percent of Americans approve of the indictment of former President Donald Trump, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS following the news that a New York grand jury voted to charge him in connection with hush money payments made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. About three-quarters of Americans say politics played at least some role in the decision to indict Trump, including 52% who said it played a major role. Independents largely line up in support of the indictment \u2013 62% approve of it and 38% disapprove. Democrats are near universal in their support for the indictment (94% approve, including 71% who strongly approve of the indictment), with Republicans less unified in opposition (79% disapprove, with 54% strongly disapproving). In between rounds of golf, Trump considers how best to use indictment as 2024 rallying cry While views on the indictment are split along party lines, the poll finds that majorities across major demographic divides all approve of the decision to indict the former president. That includes gender (62% of women, 58% of men), racial and ethnic groups (82% of Black adults, 71% of Hispanic adults, 51% of White adults), generational lines (69% under age 35; 62% age 35-49; 53% age 50-64; 54% 65 or older) and educational levels (68% with college degrees, 56% with some college or less). CNN has reported that the former president faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud, but the indictment remains under seal and the charges were not publicly known at the time of the survey. The investigation relates to a $130,000 payment made by Trump\u2019s then-personal attorney, Michael Cohen, to Daniels in late October 2016, days before the 2016 presidential election, to silence her from going public about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied the affair. At issue in the investigation is the payment made to Daniels and the Trump Organization\u2019s reimbursement to Cohen. A scant 10% overall see Trump as blameless regarding payments made to Daniels, but Americans are divided about whether his actions were illegal or merely unethical. About 4 in 10 say he acted illegally (37%), 33% unethically but not illegally, and another 20% say they aren\u2019t sure. Only 8% of political independents say Trump did nothing wrong, and among the rest, they are mostly on board with the indictment even if they aren\u2019t already convinced Trump did something illegal. Even among those who disapprove of the indictment, the perception that Trump\u2019s actions were questionable is fairly widespread, with about half in that group saying Trump did something wrong regarding payments to Daniels (52%). Far more in that group say he acted unethically rather than illegally, though (49% unethical, 3% illegal), with the remainder split between thinking he did nothing wrong (23%) and not being sure (24%). Among those who approve of the decision to indict Trump, just 1% say his actions were not wrong at all, while 59% call them illegal and 23% unethical. The survey suggests that the indictment has not had a major effect on views of Trump personally. The poll finds his favorability rating at 34% favorable to 58% unfavorable, similar to his standing in a January CNN poll, in which 32% held a favorable view of the former president and 63% an unfavorable one. Among Republicans, 72% hold a favorable view in the new poll, similar to the 68% who felt that way in January. Most Americans (76%) believe politics played at least some role in the decision to indict Trump, who is both a former president and current candidate for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. About half (52%) see it as having played \u201ca major role\u201d in the decision, while around a quarter say it played a minor role and 14% no role at all. Another 10% are unsure if politics was a factor in the grand jury\u2019s vote. Nearly all Republicans, 93%, see the indictment as politically motivated, including 83% who say politics played a major role. Among independents, 52% say politics played a major role; that drops to 25% among Democrats. Americans are split over the effect the indictment may have on democracy. About three in 10 say the decision strengthens US democracy (31%) and an identical share say it weakens democracy (31%). Roughly a quarter say it has no effect on democracy (23%) and 15% are unsure. Republicans broadly see it as weakening democracy (62% say so). Two-thirds of those who disapprove of the indictment say the same (67%) as do 54% of those who believe politics played a major role in the decision to indict. Most Democrats see it as strengthening democracy (55%). Among those who approve of the indictment, 48% say it strengthens democracy and 30% that it has no effect on it. The poll also finds that Americans split over the investigation launched by House Republicans into Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s handling of the Trump case, with 38% saying they disapprove of the GOP\u2019s efforts to investigate him, 35% saying they approve, and a sizable 27% unsure how they feel about the investigation. More than 9 in 10 Americans have heard at least a little about the historic indictment, with 51% saying they\u2019ve heard a lot. Democrats are most apt to be highly tuned in, with 56% saying they\u2019ve heard a lot about the charges, compared with 48% each among independents and Republicans. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS on March 31 and April 1 among a random national sample of 1,048 adults surveyed by text message after being recruited using probability-based methods. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.0 percentage points. It is larger for subgroups. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the correct percentage of independents who approve of the indictment of former President Donald Trump.

            "article_content": "Brandon Johnson sought to echo Martin Luther King Jr. last week at the biggest rally of the Chicago mayor\u2019s race so far, telling a crowd of thousands that the election was an opportunity to \u201ctake the progressive movement around the world.\u201d Johnson, the progressive Cook County commissioner, faces moderate former Chicago public schools chief Paul Vallas in the Second City mayoral runoff on Tuesday \u2013 a day that marks the 55th anniversary of King\u2019s assassination. At the rally Thursday, Johnson invoked King\u2019s remarks during a 17-month campaign that began in 1965 to reverse discriminatory housing practices in Chicago. \u201cIf we can figure it out in Chicago, we can figure it out anywhere in the world,\u201d Johnson said alongside the late civil rights leader\u2019s son Martin Luther King III. Lightfoot's loss makes Chicago the latest major city to face mayoral test over crime His comments offered a window into the racial and ideological divides that could decide the outcome of a contest in which Black and Latino voters who supported other candidates in the February first round are the most important constituency. And the runoff result could hint at the mood of the Democratic electorate as the 2024 presidential election gets underway and shape how the party\u2019s candidates across the political map seek to build coalitions and how they discuss crime and policing. Nine candidates, including incumbent Mayor Lori Lightfoot, competed in the February 28 mayoral election in Chicago, with Vallas and Johnson advancing to the runoff as the top finishers. Vallas\u2019 early message focused almost exclusively on cracking down on crime by adding more police officers, emphasizing community policing and placing law enforcement on public transit. He is backed by the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police and has a base of support that is largely White and more moderate. Johnson, a former teacher and Chicago Teachers Union organizer, is endorsed by the teachers\u2019 union. A relatively unknown figure just months ago, he has since emerged as a progressive star. The two candidates have courted Black pastors and community leaders during the runoff. Johnson, who is Black, is seeking to expand what\u2019s seen as an advantage among Black voters, while Vallas, who is White, looks to broaden his base of support from White ethnic neighborhoods and the largely White northwestern region of the city. Latinos, who make up nearly 30% of Chicago\u2019s population, according to the US Census Bureau, could prove to be a critical swing group in the runoff. Democratic Rep. Jes\u00fas \u201cChuy\u201d Garc\u00eda, who finished fourth in the February election, was the top vote-getter in several heavily Latino wards and has since thrown his support to Johnson. It\u2019s not clear whether a result will be known Tuesday night. Chicago counts mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day, and the number of ballots left to arrive and be counted could be larger than the winning margin on election night, if the race is as close as many strategists and political observers in the city expect. The race has in many ways illustrated the broader divides within the Democratic Party. Progressives, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have championed Johnson. More moderate figures, including Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin and several well-known Chicago politicians, have aligned with Vallas. Chicago mayoral candidates Johnson and Vallas clash over policing in debate At the Thursday night rally for Johnson at an arena at the University of Illinois Chicago, Sanders, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and Martin Luther King III all lit into Vallas. Sanders described the candidate \u2013 who is backed by business figures and some Republicans and performed best in February in the city\u2019s largely White areas \u2013 as aligned with \u201cthe speculators and billionaires.\u201d \u201cAnd I know which side Brandon is on,\u201d Sanders said. Weingarten pointed to support Vallas has received from the Illinois Federation for Children PAC, which has gotten funding from the campaign arm of a conservative group founded by former Trump Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. The PAC spent more than $59,000 on digital ads backing Vallas in March, Illinois campaign finance records show. Vallas has rejected the group\u2019s support. \u201cI don\u2019t care what he says \u2013 for Betsy DeVos and her PAC to come in and support Paul Vallas tells you everything you need to know about him,\u201d Weingarten said. Johnson, meanwhile, has focused in recent weeks on branding Vallas as a Republican in the technically nonpartisan race. The former schools chief in Chicago, Philadelphia and New Orleans says he is a Democrat \u2013 he was the party\u2019s 2014 nominee for Illinois lieutenant governor \u2013 but he has made critical remarks about several top Democrats as recently as 2021. \u201cWhen you take dollars from Trump supporters and try to pass yourself as a part of the progressive movement \u2013 man, sit down,\u201d Johnson said at the Thursday rally. Vallas, who is making his second bid for Chicago mayor, entered the runoff with a commanding advantage, having won 33% of the vote in the February election \u2013 well ahead of Johnson\u2019s second-place finish at 22%. But his base of support, more conservative and more White than other contenders, carried risks. Chicago is a diverse, overwhelmingly blue city, with 83% of its electorate backing the Democratic ticket in the 2020 presidential election. Vallas, on the campaign trail and in television advertisements, has attempted to prove he is an ideological match for the Democratic city. His closing television advertisement begins with a narrator setting the theme: \u201cDemocrats for Democrat Paul Vallas.\u201d The 30-second spot features Durbin, former Rep. Bobby Rush \u2013 the only politician to have defeated former President Barack Obama, in a 2000 House Democratic primary \u2013 and former longtime Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White, as well as some of Vallas\u2019 former rivals in the mayoral election who have since endorsed him. \u201cPaul will invest in the South and West sides,\u201d Rush, who is Black, says in the ad. Those regions are predominantly Black and have seen the highest rates of violent crime. The election is also a test of the organizing might of the police and teachers\u2019 unions. Both have feuded with outgoing Mayor Lightfoot, who missed the runoff after finishing third \u2013 an outcome driven in part by her frayed relationships with those powerful groups. But Vallas, while leaning into his pro-police message, has been careful to keep at bay the Fraternal Order of Police \u2013 which is unpopular in some parts of Chicago, in part due to the incendiary views of its president, John Catanzara, who wrote on his 2021 retirement paperwork: \u201cFinally!!! Let\u2019s go Brandon.\u201d The phrase is used by some conservatives as a coded insult to President Joe Biden. Ja\u2019Mal Green, an activist and unsuccessful mayoral candidate who has since endorsed Vallas, posted a video on Twitter last month in which Vallas said he has turned down Fraternal Order of Police donations and is independent of the group. \u201cI\u2019m not beholden to anybody,\u201d Vallas said in the video. Chicago Police Department lowered its hiring standards amid staffing shortages. That's led to a spike in applicants Vallas has, however, hammered Johnson \u2013 who in the past has supported calls to defund the police but now says that while he supports funding other programs aimed at reducing crime he would not look to slash the police budget \u2013 for a policy proposal to promote hundreds of additional detectives. Vallas argues that Johnson\u2019s plan would leave police vacancies unfilled and would not address crime on public transportation. Vallas has said he would fill police vacancies and attempt to stanch the flow of retirements, which he argues stem from police not feeling supported. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve basically said is let\u2019s fill the vacancies \u2013 and one of the ways you fill the vacancies is you slow the exodus of officers,\u201d Vallas said on \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d last month. \u201cWe\u2019ve been losing 1,000 a year because of poor leadership, terrible strategy and really the mismanagement of personnel. And we can significantly solve that exodus.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the wake of a Manhattan grand jury\u2019s historic decision to indict Donald Trump, the former president and some other prominent Republicans, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have invoked liberal billionaire George Soros in their attacks on Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. Trump claimed in a statement that Bragg was \u201chand-picked and funded by George Soros.\u201d Here are the facts. Soros, a longtime supporter of Democratic campaigns, various liberal causes and prosecutors who favor criminal justice reform, has been a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories painting the Jewish philanthropist as a puppetmaster behind various US and international events. Soros did not make any direct contributions to Bragg\u2019s 2021 election campaign, and a Soros spokesperson, Michael Vachon, told CNN last week that the two men have never once communicated in any way. Rather, Soros\u2019s connection to Bragg is indirect: he has been a major donor to a liberal political action committee that supported Bragg\u2019s candidacy. A spokesperson for the PAC denounced the Soros-related attacks on Bragg in an interview with CNN last week, calling them \u201cantisemitic,\u201d \u201canti-Black\u201d and an overstatement of both Soros\u2019s role in the PAC\u2019s decision-making and the PAC\u2019s role in Bragg\u2019s election victory. Bragg is a graduate of Harvard Law School, a former federal prosecutor and a former chief deputy attorney general for New York state. He won a competitive Democratic primary for Manhattan district attorney in 2021, against an opponent who had millions more to spend, and then trounced a Republican in the general election. Bragg\u2019s successful campaign was supported by the political action committee affiliated with Color of Change, a nonprofit advocacy group \u2013 co-founded in 2005 by Van Jones, who later became a CNN commentator \u2013 that promotes criminal justice reform among other racial justice causes. The Color of Change PAC, which has backed progressive district attorney candidates around the country, spent slightly over $500,000 supporting Bragg, Color of Change president and PAC spokesperson Rashad Robinson told CNN last week. The Color of Change PAC has received significant funding from Soros, who has for years been a vocal advocate of criminal justice reform and of progressive district attorney candidates. Soros was the PAC\u2019s biggest donor in the 2021-2022 period, PolitiFact has reported. Soros spokesperson Vachon told CNN last week: \u201cBetween 2016 and 2022, George Soros personally and Democracy PAC (a PAC to which Mr. Soros has contributed funds) have together contributed roughly $4 million to Color of Change\u2019s PAC, including $1 million in May 2021. None of those funds were earmarked for Alvin Bragg\u2019s campaign. George Soros and Alvin Bragg have never meet in person or spoken by telephone, email, Zoom etc. There has been no contact between the two.\u201d In addition to these donations to the PAC, CNBC reported that another Soros organization, the Open Society Policy Center, gave the main Color of Change nonprofit $7 million in 2021. Open Society spokesperson Thomas Watson told CNN in an email last week that the funding was a five-year grant and part of a publicly announced $220 million investment in racial justice efforts focused on Black-led organizations; Watson said the grant was \u201cin support of (Color of Change\u2019s) social welfare activities, and not earmarked for any specific work. The grant agreement stipulates, among other restrictions, that no OSPC funding can be used for partisan or political activities.\u201d As PolitiFact has noted, Soros\u2019s son, Jonathan Soros, and Jonathan\u2019s wife, Jennifer Allan Soros, each made $10,000 donations to Bragg\u2019s campaign during the Democratic primary in April 2021. They had made smaller donations, totaling $450, earlier in the year. Robinson said that attacks suggesting Bragg is a puppet of Soros, because of George Soros\u2019s donations to the Color of Change PAC, are not only \u201cantisemitic\u201d but also \u201canti-Black.\u201d He said the attack is premised on the idea that \u201cBlack people are so incapable of having their own ideas about how to fight for justice\u201d that the Black-led PAC could not have come up with its own strategies. Robinson scoffed at the notion that the PAC was solely responsible for Bragg\u2019s victory; he said that it was \u201cvery important\u201d but \u201cone of many factors.\u201d \u201cUp until last week we couldn\u2019t get people to write about our PAC\u2026now all of a sudden we singlehandedly elected the Manhattan DA. But when he was elected, I didn\u2019t get that credit,\u201d he said. Robinson also said that, contrary to the notion that Soros funneled money to Color of Change PAC in an attempt to target Trump, Soros has been involved in criminal justice reform efforts for decades, \u201csince before Color of Change existed.\u201d Soros has for years made significant contributions in support of progressive district attorney candidates around the country. Robinson said it \u201cjust feels like such reaching,\u201d at this unprecedented historical moment for a former president, \u201cthat now a Black nonprofit is being made part of the story.\u201d Trump claimed last week that Soros spent more than $1 million on Bragg\u2019s campaign, but that figure is inaccurate. The Color of Change PAC did announce in May 2021, the month that Soros made a $1 million donation to the PAC, that it was planning to spend over $1 million on an independent expenditure campaign in support of Bragg\u2019s candidacy. But the PAC paused the pro-Bragg spending after hearing an uncorroborated allegation against Bragg that it was not able to thoroughly investigate at the time because of legal restrictions on PACs communicating with candidates, Robinson said. It ended up spending about half of what it had planned, Robinson said, and kept the rest of Soros\u2019s donation for other uses. \u201cSoros didn\u2019t give us money to give to Alvin Bragg. Soros made a donation to Color of Change,\u201d Robinson said.",

            "article_content": "Allene Jue used to vote in a simple, rapid manner  \u2013 scan the names on the ballot and pick the Asian sounding names. That was before 2020. \u201cSomething turned on during the pandemic and lit a fire,\u201d said Jue, a Chinese American mother of two girls, ages 3 and 5, living on the west side of San Francisco. Throughout the pandemic, Jue watched as violent hate crimes against Asian Americans brought fear to the community with not enough response from local law enforcement or prosecutors. As the school closures wore on and on in California, Jue saw her local school board discuss progressive policy issues like renaming schools ahead of focusing on simply returning students to the classroom. Jue, who generally considers herself a Democrat, recalled her anger at liberal local politicians. \u201cThey care about policies that don\u2019t really help someone who just lives in the city and just want to be safe, who wants their kids to be educated well,\u201d she said. \u201cThey forgot the core problems for regular people. I wanted to do something to try to change and take that power back. It was fear and frustration, a lot of frustration, that I turned into action.\u201d Her involvement began with stuffing envelopes for recall campaigns against the district attorney and several school board members and then grew \u2013 she even appeared in Chinese language campaign ads for a moderate Democrat running for city supervisor. It was a political awakening replicated to varying degrees by other Asian Americans in San Francisco, resulting in a series of political upheavals in one of the United States\u2019 most progressive cities \u2013 including a moderate White man unseating a progressive Chinese American incumbent for supervisor of the majority-Asian American Sunset District California activists warn that these shifts in the politics of San Francisco \u2013 a place that has long been a beacon for progressives \u2013 are a signal to national Democrats ahead of 2024 that the party needs a course correction with the fastest growing racial group in the US \u2013 Asian Americans. \u201cI see this frustration with the direction of the party,\u201d said Charles Jung, a civil rights attorney and local Bay Area advocate. \u201cAsian Americans feel like Democrats are focused on the wrong things, that they\u2019ve let ideology run amok. If Democrats don\u2019t redouble their efforts to focus on core Democratic issues, they will lose people of color over time.\u201d Supervisor Joel Engardio, a gay married man who by most national standards is a liberal, describes himself as a moderate in San Francisco. And he is quick to criticize the word \u201cprogressive.\u201d \u201cTo me, progressive is forward thinking, moving into the future and building a better city,\u201d said Engardio from his San Francisco City Hall office. \u201cFor too long, we have not followed that definition of progressive. Progressive is a city that works and functions and builds toward the future.\u201d Engardio unseated a Chinese American incumbent last year, becoming the first non-Asian supervisor to represent the majority Asian American district in more than 20 years. He campaigned on removing roadblocks for small businesses, putting more police officers on the streets, and using merit-standards for public schools. He said his supervisor race, while close, sends a broader political message about the limits of liberal ideology. \u201cWe should all pay attention that San Francisco, the most liberal place in America, is saying enough. We want safe streets. We want good schools. That should tell anyone \u2013 pay attention,\u201d said Engardio. CNN national exit polls do show the pendulum shifting among Asian American voters in recent elections. In 2018, during the Donald Trump presidency, Asian Americans overwhelmingly supported Democrats by 77% vs. Republicans at 23%. In 2022, Asian Americans remained supportive of Democrats, but that preference slid 58% vs. Republicans at 40%. That\u2019s a significant shift, warns Jung. \u201cYou saw a substantial double-digit erosion of support from Asian Americans from this midterm election to 2018. And incidentally, it\u2019s not just Asian Americans, you saw the same thing among Hispanic voters,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if Democrats don\u2019t redouble their efforts to focus on core democratic issues, they will lose people of color over time.\u201d While Asian Americans may be thought of as a Democratic constituency, Jung warns recent history shows that wasn\u2019t always the case. CNN\u2019s historical exit polls on congressional vote choice show Asian American voters were closely divided or tilting toward Republicans in the 1990s. But since 1998, they have generally leaned toward the Democratic Party, by varying margins. Erosion among Asian and Latino voters, said Kanishka Cheng of grassroots community building organization Together SF, is explained by Democrats forgetting the core values for immigrant communities. \u201cDemocrats have a really hard time talking about public education and public safety,\u201d said Cheng. \u201cThat\u2019s the common denominator between the Asian and Latino community \u2013 we are immigrant communities. We came to America for stability and opportunity. Public safety and public education are the things that give us stability and opportunity. We need education and we need to feel safe.\u201d Engardio said that message came through loud and clear as he knocked on \u201c14,000 doors, talking to voters. My advice is to talk about what they need, and actually, listen.\u201d Listening to Asian American voters is the work that Forrest Liu continues in the Sunset District as 2024 approaches. A former Bay Area finance worker, Liu left the business world and became an Asian community advocate to fight hate crimes targeting Asians. Liu spends his day conducting field interviews to try to understand the political shift that took place among San Francisco\u2019s Asian voters, because Liu believes it\u2019s predictive of what will happen in the upcoming national elections. \u201cI want to understand why they made the decisions they made last year and what they want moving forward. And what we should be advocating for,\u201d said Liu. What he\u2019s learned so far, he said, is the community is far savvier than politicians may think. \u201cThere are some politicians out there who are like, \u2018Let me get in a photo with some Asian people. Let me walk through Chinatown, shake hands with a few Asian community leaders and that\u2019s it. I got the Asian vote,\u2019\u201d said Liu. \u201cNo. You actually need to be in tune with what this demographic needs.\u201d Liu said the political discontent that led to Engardio\u2019s victory remains, even as publicity around \u201cStop Asian Hate\u201d may have faded. \u201c\u2018Why should I feel unsafe?\u2019 I would say that\u2019s the summary of the emotion of the people I\u2019m interviewing. They still feel unsafe.\u201d You hear three languages spoken in Jue\u2019s house \u2013 English, Mandarin and Cantonese. Her 5-year-old daughter, Eloise, is in a Cantonese immersion kindergarten, though she also speaks Mandarin. Lucille, 3, speaks Mandarin to her parents. Jue flips from one language to the next, a product of the multilingual public schools in San Francisco. \u201cI\u2019m a public school kid, from kindergarten all the way to college,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a common background from my core group \u2013 children of immigrants who went through public school.\u201d Work hard, strive for educational success, and build a safe community \u2013 that\u2019s what Jue and her generation grew up seeking. The effects of the pandemic began to crack into all those core values. The attacks targeting Asian American \u2013 which spiked 567% from 2019 to 2021 in San Francisco \u2013 worried Jue. \u201cI\u2019m Asian, my family\u2019s Asian. If I have to worry about just stepping out to run an errand, I think that\u2019s a huge problem and I can\u2019t live in a city like that,\u201d she said. Amid those concerns in 2021, Jue noticed the school board vote to rename 44 schools whose names were linked to former presidents like Abraham Lincoln, stating the names were linked to \u201cthe subjugation and enslavement of human beings/ or who oppressed women.\u201d The school district at that time still had shared no public plan for reopening schools. Jue, juggling working at her tech job and raising kids about to enter pre-school, was incensed. Jue was among the Asian Americans in San Francisco who rolled out recall actions first against the school board, recalling three members. Jue then helped the successful effort to recall San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin, which a majority of the west side Asian communities backed. Last November, Jue volunteered for her neighboring district\u2019s supervisor race \u2013 where Engardio successfully challenged the Sunset district\u2019s sitting city supervisor. She was featured in two Mandarin and Cantonese campaign ads. Like many political shifts, Jue said the Sunset District was driven by discontent. And Jue said that discontent, while felt most profoundly in her city, is not limited to San Francisco. The self-described socially liberal-fiscal conservative said while she is a registered Democrat, she struggles with the current state of the party entering 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ve gotten those basics down yet, like crime and education,\u201d said Jue. \u201cI know of folks that have traditionally voted Democrat that are now voting Republican because they do not feel that the Democratic Party is representing them.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Heading into the next presidential election, an analysis of CNN polls shows that Republicans have reverted to the deeply negative national outlook they held prior to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory in 2016. They again are convinced the nation is in decline, and more often defensive against demographic and cultural changes in US society. In a poll conducted late in the summer of 2016, following Trump\u2019s nomination, roughly half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (49%) said America\u2019s best days lay behind us. And while most said they considered the country\u2019s increasing diversity enriching, 37% said they felt the increasing number of people of many different races, ethnic groups and nationalities in the US was, instead, threatening American culture. Three years later, during Trump\u2019s presidency, only 18% of the party said the nation was past its peak days, with a similar 20% viewing diversity as a cultural threat. Since then, the GOP has reversed course, becoming less pluralistic and even more pessimistic. In CNN\u2019s latest polling, released this week, the share of Republican-aligned adults who said the country\u2019s best days are over had skyrocketed to 70%, while the percentage saying that America\u2019s culture was threatened by increasing racial and ethnic diversity rebounded to 38%. In a question not asked in 2019, a broad 78% majority of Republican-aligned Americans also say that society\u2019s values on sexual orientation and gender identity are changing for the worse. The party\u2019s shift in perspective over the past four years took place across demographic lines. Between 2019 and 2023, the belief that the country\u2019s best days are behind it rose by more than 40 percentage points across age, educational and gender lines. Additionally, the share considering diversity a threat rose by double digits in each group. That may suggest that the results sometimes represent not deep-seated beliefs so much as a reaction to the current political environment, including which party holds the presidency. But the survey also finds Republicans and Republican-leaners are far from wholly unified in their views, with a constellation of interrelated political, demographic and socioeconomic factors dividing views. One of the most persistent gaps appears along educational lines, with Republican-aligned college graduates less likely than those without degrees to favor a more active government, say the country\u2019s best days have passed or to consider the country\u2019s increased diversity threatening \u2013 though both groups share similarly negative views about changing values around gender and sexuality. Age also plays a role, as do gender and race: Those younger than 45 are less likely than older adults to call racial diversity a threat or to say values on gender identity and sexual orientation are changing for the worse, with a similar divide between GOP women and men, and between White people and people of color aligned with the party. Differences within the GOP are often magnified when demographics intersect. Roughly half (51%) of Republican-aligned adults ages 45 or older who don\u2019t have a college degree say they consider the country\u2019s increased diversity threatening, an opinion shared by a third or fewer within any other combination of age and education. And, within the GOP, 54% majority of male, White evangelical Christians find such diversity threatening, a view not shared by most of their female counterparts, or by majorities of those of other combinations of racial and religious backgrounds. Republicans\u2019 unease with the way that the US is changing ties into opinions of Trump\u2019s legacy. In the latest poll, a 57% majority of Republican-aligned adults who call racial diversity threatening also say it\u2019s essential that the next GOP nominee would restore the policies of the Trump administration. So do nearly half of those who say values on gender and sexuality are changing for the worse (49%) or who feel the nation\u2019s best days have come and gone (46%) \u2013 in each case, a significantly higher figure than among those who don\u2019t share those views. Belief that Trump has had a good effect on the Republican Party, meanwhile, is 14 percentage points higher among those who say the US has peaked than among those who say its best days lie ahead. What\u2019s less clear is whether those outlooks will drive support for Trump and his campaign, particularly with presumptive rivals like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also building messages around similar themes. At this early stage in the campaign, Republicans and Republican leaning-independents who say the US\u2019s best days have passed are about equally likely to say they\u2019d be enthusiastic about the possibility of a DeSantis nomination as they are to say the same of Trump. Relatively few currently express similar excitement about former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, or former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. It\u2019s also too early to tell what next year\u2019s GOP primary electorate will look like. That\u2019s a key factor, given the likely demographic divides both in whom Republicans support and in how likely they are to vote at all. Older and more highly educated voters are more likely to turn out. Exit polling suggests that in past cycles, older and more highly educated voters tended to turn out disproportionately. This far from the start of voting, it\u2019s hard to tell who\u2019s likely to show up, but both demographics and political preference could play a role in determining initial levels of enthusiasm heading into the election season. In the latest CNN poll, Republicans and Republican-leaners over age 45 who supported Trump were far more likely to report extreme enthusiasm about participating in next year\u2019s primaries than those over 45 with a different candidate preference, or younger Republicans and Republican-leaners regardless of the candidate they back. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS from March 8-12 among a random national sample of 1,045 self-identified Republicans and Republican-leaning independents drawn from a probability-based panel. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results among the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 points, it is larger for subgroups.

            "article_content": "The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was lauded by former clerks and colleagues at a memorial ceremony held at the Supreme Court on Friday \u2013 an institution she\u2019d scarcely recognize if she were still on the bench. During the special session of the court, delayed because of Covid-19, Chief Justice John Roberts pointed to Ginsburg\u2019s dedication to equality and said she \u201cchanged our country profoundly for the better.\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said her opinions were \u201cconcise and elegant.\u201d Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, a former clerk, called the justice\u2019s work the \u201cstuff of legend.\u201d (Prelogar also revealed Ginsburg\u2019s passion for chocolate fondue.) But as the legal luminaries mingled in the Great Hall outside the marble-lined chamber, little was said about how much the court has changed in the 130 weeks since Ginsburg\u2019s passing. Kavanaugh and Alito said judges would be out of the abortion equation. That's not the case Fresh on the minds of many is the unprecedented leak last May of a draft opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, a disclosure the court described as a \u201cgrave assault on the judicial process.\u201d In addition, however, the current conservative majority, including Ginsburg\u2019s replacement, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, is working expeditiously to reverse much of what Ginsburg stood for in areas such as reproductive health, voting rights, affirmative action, administrative law and religious liberty. In the past few months, the court has seen its approval ratings plummet amid claims that it has become irreparably political. Even the relationships between the justices, while cordial, have frayed in public over debates concerning the court\u2019s legitimacy. As conservatives praise the court\u2019s new season, others mourn the dismantling of Ginsburg\u2019s life work. \u201cWe are in the midst of a constitutional revolution, and the praise being lavished on Ruth Bader Ginsburg today, should not cause us to lose sight of that fact,\u201d said Neil S. Siegel, a professor at Duke University and former Ginsburg clerk. Lara Bazelon, a law professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law, put it more forcefully in an interview with CNN: \u201cThe current court is taking a wrecking ball to her legacy to smash it to smithereens.\u201d Ginsburg died at 87 years old on September 18, 2020, having spent some 40 years as a federal judge \u2013 27 on the high court. She worked until the end, even dialing into oral arguments from her hospital bed in Baltimore in May 2020 to chastise a lawyer for the Trump administration. The case at hand concerned a religion-based challenge to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that employer-provided health insurance plans cover birth control as a preventive service. \u201cYou have tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential, that is that women be provided these services with no hassles, no cost to them,\u201d Ginsburg said. After her death \u2013 less than seven weeks before Election Day \u2013 then-President Donald Trump praised her. \u201cShe was an amazing woman whether you agree or not she was an amazing woman who led an amazing life,\u201d he said, while as expected, moving with dispatch to push through the nomination of a candidate believed to be Ginsburg\u2019s ideological opposite in many areas: Justice Amy Coney Barrett . The shift from Ginsburg to Barrett is akin to 1991 when Justice Thurgood Marshall, a legend of the civil rights movement who often cast his votes with the liberals on the bench, was replaced with Justice Clarence Thomas, who has become a hero of the conservative right. Supreme Court embarrassed by the opinion leak is embarrassed again The philosophical differences between the two jurists was almost immediately evident in disputes over the religious liberty implications of state Covid restrictions. When Ginsburg was still alive, the court ruled in favor of the states with Roberts serving as the swing vote. But after Barrett\u2019s confirmation, the houses of worship won. Barrett \u2013 a former clerk to Ginsburg\u2019s friend, the late Justice Antonin Scalia \u2013 has also embraced the constitutional theory of originalism, a judicial philosophy championed by Scalia. Under the doctrine, the Constitution should be interpreted based on its original public reading. Just last term the court divided along familiar ideological lines in several cases and Barrett sided with the majority, cementing the court\u2019s conservative turn. Barrett\u2019s presence also means that Roberts no longer controls the court, as there are five votes to his right on some of the most divisive issues of the day. \u201cHe is no longer empowered to moderate the very conservative direction in which the court\u2019s other conservatives are pushing the institution,\u201d Siegel said. The biggest blow for liberals last term came in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, an opinion penned by Justice Samuel Alito that reversed Roe \u2013 a decision that had been on the books during Ginsburg\u2019s entire tenure. While she enjoyed a cordial relationship for the most part with her colleagues, Siegel and Bazelon said she would have been surprised by specific references Alito made to an article she wrote in 1992 as a lower court judge. On the 3rd page of his opinion Alito argued that when Roe was decided it was such a broad decision that it \u201ceffectively struck down the abortion laws of every single state.\u201d He went on to say that it has \u201cembittered our political culture for a half century.\u201d After that sentiment he cited Ginsburg\u2019s article in a footnote, where she wrote that the sweep of the decision had \u201chalted a political process that was moving in a reform direction and thereby, I believed, prolonged divisiveness and deferred stable settlement of the issue.\u201d Some believe Alito included the quotation to point out that Ginsburg, along with others, felt like the court may have moved too fast too soon in the opinion. But others question his use of the citation, especially because Ginsburg never questioned the result of the decision, only its reasoning in certain sections. Samuel Alito lashes out at liberals in guns case as tensions boil over at SCOTUS \u201cAlito\u2019s citation is both cynical and misleading, implying that Justice Ginsburg disapproved of the Roe holding,\u201d Bazelon said. That couldn\u2019t be \u201cfarther from the truth,\u201d she said, pointing out that Ginsburg\u2019s disagreement was that the reasoning should have \u201choned in more precisely on the women\u2019s equality dimension.\u201d She noted that Ginsburg always agreed with the result of the opinion. In the last years of her life Ginsburg was asked what would happen if the court were to ever overturn Roe and she said that it would have a particularly harsh impact on women who did not have the means to travel across state lines to obtain the procedure. Those words were echoed in the joint dissent last term filed by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan in Dobbs. \u201cAbove all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from today\u2019s decision,\u201d they wrote. On Friday, Breyer, now retired, sat in the front row, next to retired Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kennedy was replaced in 2018 by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who also voted to overturn Roe. During her final term, Ginsburg may have known Roe was in jeopardy. There were, after all, likely five members skeptical of the opinion. But she may have felt that Roberts could be persuaded to stop short of overturning precedent out of respect for the stability of the law. The very fact that she thought Roe could be in danger, was a signal that Ginsburg saw changes afoot before her passing. She often lamented the politicization of the court that she thought could be traced partly to the confirmation process. She noted that in 1993 when she was nominated by President Bill Clinton she was confirmed by a vote of 96-3 even though she had served as a lawyer for the liberal ACLU. In modern day confirmation hearings, that vote would have been much closer. Last term, in a rash of 6-3 decisions the fissures were evident. After dodging Second Amendment cases for years, for example, the court crafted a 6-3 opinion marking the widest expansion of gun rights in a decade. Kagan dissented when a 6-3 court curbed the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to broadly regulate carbon emissions from existing power plants, a writing that seemed to trigger Kagan\u2019s inner Ginsburg. She criticized the court for stripping the EPA of the \u201cpower Congress gave it to respond to \u2018the most pressing environmental challenge of our time.\u201d \u201cThe Court appoints itself \u2013 instead of Congress or the expert agency \u2013 the decision-maker on climate policy,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot think of many things more frightening,\u201d Kagan concluded. The conservative court is not finished. In 2013, Ginsburg wrote a scathing dissent when Roberts penned an opinion gutting a key section of the historic Voting Rights Act. Ginsburg wrote at the time that weakening the law when it \u201chas worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\u201d This term, the court is tackling another section of the same law. And the court is considering whether to bar colleges and universities from taking race into consideration as a factor in admissions plans. In 2002, Ginsburg memorably wrote about why such programs are necessary. \u201cThe stain of generations of racial oppression is still visible in our society, and the determination to hasten its removal remains vital,\u201d she said. On Friday former clerk Amanda L. Tyler spoke lovingly about her late boss who, she said, had been described as a \u201cprophet, an American hero, a rock of righteousness, and a national treasure.\u201d She said Ginsburg had \u201cthe best qualities a judge can have: lawyerly precision, an abiding dedication to procedural integrity, a commitment to opening up access to the justice system to ensure that the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.\u201d The event in the great hushed hall, like many other memorials, served as a reunion of sorts for Ginsburg\u2019s family and her acolytes and a respite from the court\u2019s regular order. On Monday, the justices take the bench again for a new set of cases.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The Make America Great Again movement isn\u2019t so sure that\u2019s possible anymore. That\u2019s according to a new CNN poll of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents conducted by SSRS. While the poll is most focused on the political landscape ahead of the 2024 presidential election, the number that stands out most is the one that suggests a deep pessimism about what\u2019s to come. This is from CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta and Ariel Edwards-Levy: Just 30% of all Republicans and Republican-leaners say the country\u2019s best days are still ahead of it \u2013 a dramatic shift from 2019, when Trump held the White House and 77% were optimistic that the best was ahead, and lower even than the 43% who said the same in the summer of 2016, prior to Trump\u2019s election. It\u2019s natural that Republicans and Republican-leaning independents would have a dimmer view during a Democratic administration, but the decline from the end of the Obama administration is noteworthy. Toward the end of the Trump administration, strong majorities on both sides of the political aisle (67% of those who lean toward Democrats and 77% of those who lean toward Republicans) said the country\u2019s best days were ahead. That less than a third of those who lean toward the GOP say the same thing today suggests a dramatic mood shift. Note: When we refer to poll respondents in this story, we\u2019re referring both to Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. There have been warnings about a general national depression before. Then-President Jimmy Carter addressed the nation in July 1979 \u2013 10 days after scuttling a previously planned speech about the energy crisis and subsequently trying to speak to a cross section of Americans \u2013 and declared a \u201ccrisis of confidence\u201d in the country. \u201cFor the first time in the history of our country, a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years,\u201d Carter said in the remarks, which were mocked by his opponents as his \u201cmalaise\u201d speech, although he did not use the word \u201cmalaise.\u201d The lack of optimism he transmitted to the country has been blamed for contributing to his loss in the presidential election a year later. The opinion columnist David French recently wrote in The New York Times that Carter\u2019s speech sounds almost prophetic when read through the lens of today\u2019s political climate. \u201cIt\u2019s an address better suited to our time than to its own,\u201d according to French. It\u2019s certainly true that some of the themes Carter touched on \u2013 inflation, energy prices, political divisions and an intractable political process \u2013 hit a nerve today. \u201cThe erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America,\u201d Carter said back then. He added: \u201cOur people are losing that faith, not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy.\u201d It\u2019s hard not to read that last line from Carter and consider another detail from the new CNN poll. More than halfway into Joe Biden\u2019s presidency and after all the allegations of 2020 voter fraud have been examined and rejected, a solid majority of Americans who lean toward the GOP \u2013 63% \u2013 still do not believe Biden legitimately won enough votes to win the presidency. Telling hard truths and encouraging a national therapy session turned out not to be winning politics for Carter and may have actually teed up Ronald Reagan to argue that he could chart a new and more optimistic course than Carter. There\u2019s a lot of overlap here. Of the Republicans-leaners who think Biden did not legitimately win, 78% also think the country\u2019s best days are behind us. Among the White Republicans and Republican-leaning independents without a college degree who form Trump\u2019s political base, 75% said the best days are behind us in CNN\u2019s poll. There\u2019s some more optimism among Republican-leaning Americans with a college degree, who were more likely to prefer Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the new poll: 64% said the best days are behind us. Trump, who has officially launched his campaign, has the strongest support among potential GOP primary voters in the CNN poll. DeSantis, who has not formally launched a campaign, is close behind. Neither man has the support of more than 40% of that potential electorate. Both men are pushing the idea to their followers that government has been weaponized against them by a racially and culturally sensitive elite \u2013 which both Trump and DeSantis derisively refer to as \u201cwoke.\u201d There is another shift Agiesta and Edwards-Levy note: Most Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (61%) say that the country\u2019s increasing racial, ethnic and national diversity is enriching American culture, but a sizable and growing share see it as a threat. The 38% who consider those changes a threat now is about twice as high as four years ago, and similar to where the party stood in 2016. Meanwhile, a broad 78% majority of Republican-aligned Americans say that society\u2019s values on sexual orientation and gender identity are changing for the worse. And 79% say the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses, just a touch below the share who felt that way at the height of the Tea Party movement during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. I couldn\u2019t help read that portion of CNN\u2019s poll and think of the new column by CNN\u2019s Ronald Brownstein, about how Republican-controlled state governments are working to seize the powers of local governance from Democratic-run cities and counties. From Brownstein: These range from Georgia legislation that would establish a new statewide commission to discipline or remove local prosecutors, to a Texas bill allowing the state to take control of prosecuting election fraud cases, to moves by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey to dismiss from office elected county prosecutors who are Democrats, and a Mississippi bill that would allow a state takeover of policing in the capital city of Jackson. While the specifics of these efforts vary from minimum wage and family-leave laws to recycling policies, he argues the larger political struggle is over crime and political justice reform. Brownstein notes \u201can unmistakable racial dimension to these confrontations.\u201d He writes, \u201cIn many instances, state-level Republicans elected primarily with the support of White, non-urban voters are looking to seize power from, or remove from office, Black or Hispanic local officials elected by largely non-White urban and suburban voters.\u201d CNN\u2019s John King put an interesting segment on his \u201cInside Politics\u201d show in which he applied those current poll numbers to how the GOP primary actually works. The fact is that many states award all of their delegates to the highest vote-getter in the primary even if that vote-getter does not receive anywhere near a majority of votes. King noted that in 2016, when Trump first secured the GOP nomination, he lost the first contest in Iowa and won in New Hampshire and South Carolina, but with only about a third of the primary vote. He ultimately got about 45% of primary votes compared with the 50% split among his three chief rivals. That means the votes are likely out there to defeat Trump. But for now, it would mean Republicans would likely have to coalesce around a single alternative.",

            "article_content": "Republican-controlled state governments are opening an explosive new front in their decadelong drive to exert more control over the decisions \u2013 and decision makers \u2013 in Democratic-run cities and counties. From Florida and Mississippi to Georgia, Texas and Missouri, an array of red states are taking aggressive new steps to seize authority over local prosecutors, city policing policies, or both. These range from Georgia legislation that would establish a new statewide commission to discipline or remove local prosecutors, to a Texas bill allowing the state to take control of prosecuting election fraud cases, to moves by Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey to dismiss from office elected county prosecutors who are Democrats, and a Mississippi bill that would allow a state takeover of policing in the capital city of Jackson. Repairman recounts fending off armed robbers \u201cIf left unchecked, local jurisdictions in states with conservative legislatures whose political majority does not match their own may find themselves subject to commandeering on an unprecedented scale,\u201d said Janai Nelson, the president and director-counsel of the Legal Defense Fund, a leading civil rights group. The growing efforts by red states to seize authority over law enforcement in blue cities is drawing energy from the convergence of two powerful trends. One is the increased tendency of red states to override the decisions of those blue metros on a wide array of issues \u2013 on everything from minimum wage and family leave laws to environmental regulations, mask requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic, and even recycling policies for plastic bags. The other is the intensifying political struggle over crime that has produced an intense pushback against the demands for criminal justice reform that emerged in the nationwide protests following the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Suspect flips stolen cop car onto tracks as train approaches. See what happened next \u201cA lot of this criminal justice reform preemption is in direct response to the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d said Marissa Roy, legal team lead for Local Solutions Support Center, a group opposing the broad range of state preemption efforts. Many of the red state moves to preempt local district attorneys have targeted the so-called \u201cprogressive prosecutors\u201d elected in many large cities over recent years. But there is also an unmistakable racial dimension to these confrontations: In many instances, state-level Republicans elected primarily with the support of White, non-urban voters are looking to seize power from, or remove from office, Black or Hispanic local officials elected by largely non-White urban and suburban voters. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong hint of discrimination because most of the prosecutors they are coming after are black women, or [other] people of color who don\u2019t line up with a hard-core lock \u2018em up philosophy,\u201d said Gerald Griggs, a criminal defense attorney and president of the NAACP in Georgia. Video shows corrections officers beating Black man in custody With so many forces converging, all signs suggest the conservative drive to constrain liberal local prosecutors and assert more control over policing in heavily Democratic big cities has not nearly peaked. Indeed, former President Donald Trump has already pledged that if returned to the White House he will push a suite of aggressive federal policies to counter what he has called \u201cradical left\u201d and even \u201cMarxist\u201d prosecutors. In his dark, rambling speech earlier this month at CPAC, Trump declared that if reelected he would direct the Justice Department to launch civil rights investigations against the progressive prosecutors \u201cto make them pay for their illegal race-based enforcement of the law.\u201d The Republican governors and state legislators pushing these preemption proposals mostly argue that they are necessary to combat high crime rates in municipalities under Democratic control. \u201cAction must be taken to ensure that district attorneys are held accountable for their actions and carry out their duties by enforcing the laws we have on our books,\u201d Texas GOP state Sen. Tan Parker said when introducing a bill earlier this year that would allow the state\u2019s attorney general to remove local prosecutors. 'Extensive bleeding caused by a severe beating': Tyre Nichols preliminary autopsy results But the push is also being fueled by the resistance from some prosecutors in the blue counties of red states to enforce the wave of new socially conservative bills that have burned through those states since 2020, including bans on abortion and gender affirming surgery for minors. Andrew Warren, the elected Democratic state attorney in Hillsborough County, Florida, who DeSantis removed from office last year, for instance, had indicated he would not enforce the 15 week abortion ban the governor has signed into law. \u201cFor progressive prosecutors this is a politically self-inflicted wound,\u201d said Thomas Hogan, a former federal prosecutor and elected Republican district attorney in Chester County outside Philadelphia, who has emerged as a leading critic of the liberal district attorneys. \u201cWhen you \u2026 stand up on the tallest building in your jurisdiction and holler at the legislature that you are not going to follow their law, somebody is going to pay attention,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you do something like that you are basically waving a red cape in front of a bull.\u201d In the states, these battles have unfolded almost entirely along party lines, with Republicans pushing these initiatives and Democrats resisting them. Yet national Democrats may have muddled their message against the preemption of local criminal justice authority when so many of them in Congress, as well as President Joe Biden, joined the recent Republican-led congressional effort to overturn a sweeping criminal justice reform approved by the Washington, DC, city council. Though the congressional vote raised somewhat different issues than the state fights, the decision by so many Democrats to endorse the override effort underscores how much momentum elevated public concern about safety and disorder is generating for tough-on-crime policies. That message has been reinforced by the defeat of Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago\u2019s recent mayoral primary, last year\u2019s recall of San Francisco\u2019s reform-oriented district attorney Chesa Boudin, and the election of Eric Adams behind a crackdown platform in New York City. The state moves to preempt local prosecutorial authority has directly followed the increased electoral success of so called \u201cprogressive prosecutors\u201d committed to reducing incarceration rates, confronting racial inequities in the criminal justice system and more aggressively prosecuting police misconduct. The first of the \u201cprogressive prosecutors\u201d were elected in the mid-2010s, after the racial justice protests flowing out of Ferguson, Missouri, but the movement really accelerated after the nationwide uprising over the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Today, there are between 50-60 prosecutors considered part of the movement \u2013 including in major jurisdictions such as Manhattan, Brooklyn, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia \u2013 with jurisdiction over populations equaling about one-fifth of the US total, said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice, a group that supports criminal justice reform. And while San Francisco last year recalled Boudin, Turner pointed out that virtually all the progressive district attorneys who sought reelection have won it. The push by Republican-controlled legislators to preempt more local authority over criminal justice enforcement began soon after these prosecutors took office. In 2019, the GOP-controlled legislature in Pennsylvania passed a bill to shift authority over prosecuting some gun possession offenses from Philadelphia\u2019s liberal DA Larry Krasner to the state. In the 2021-2022 legislative session, Iowa, Tennessee and Utah also passed bills to constrain local prosecutors or to make it easier to force their removal, according to a recent compilation by the Local Solutions Support Center. Over those same two years, as cities faced growing demands from activists to shift funding from law enforcement to social services, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Missouri passed laws preventing local jurisdictions from reducing their police budgets. As the LSSC argued in its recent survey of preemption, \u201cAfter going unchallenged for centuries, prosecutorial discretion has come under fire only after local prosecutors have begun to use it to combat \u2013 rather than entrench \u2013 systemic racism.\u201d Efforts to supersede local control of law enforcement decisions in Democratic-leaning cities and counties are proliferating in red states again this year. In Georgia, the Republican-controlled state House and Senate have each passed legislation that would establish a new statewide commission to investigate, discipline and remove local district attorneys. The bill, which has the strong support of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, has raised eyebrows especially because it is advancing as the elected Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis is investigating the attempts by Trump, as well as Georgia GOP officials, to overturn the result of the 2020 election there. The Republican-controlled Texas legislature is considering seven different proposals to override or ease the removal of local prosecutors. Last week, the state\u2019s powerful and deeply conservative Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick identified as one of his priority bills for the current legislative session a measure that would allow the state to remove any local prosecutor who \u201cprohibits or materially limits the enforcement of any criminal offense.\u201d Another bill would allow the state attorney general to appoint district attorneys from neighboring counties to prosecute cases of alleged election fraud if the local DA will not. In Missouri, the state House of Representatives has approved legislation that would shift authority for prosecuting violent crimes from elected local prosecutors to a special prosecutor appointed by the governor once a county\u2019s crime rate crosses a certain level. The House has also passed legislation that would shift operational control over the police department in St. Louis to the state. And last month, Bailey, the state\u2019s Republican attorney general, began a legal process to force from office Kimberly Gardner, the St. Louis circuit attorney. In Mississippi, the Republican-controlled state legislature is advancing legislation to expand state control over policing and the courts, and largely displace local authority, in Jackson, the predominantly Black capital city. In Florida, beyond removing Warren, DeSantis\u2019 office has also begun an investigation that may culminate in the removal of Monique Worrell, the elected Democratic state\u2019s attorney in Orange County, centered on Orlando. DeSantis argues she mishandled the case of a 19-year-old man recently arrested for shooting three people in the city. Taken together, these initiatives constitute an unprecedented challenge to the independence of local prosecutors, said Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor who studies state preemption of local decisions. \u201cThis is a straightforward attack on a system we\u2019ve had in place for hundreds of years: local elections of local prosecutors,\u201d he said. Some of those targeted by these efforts, such as Krasner and Warren, are White. But in most cases, these efforts target Black local officials in heavily minority jurisdictions, including the mayors of St. Louis and Jackson; the county attorneys in the counties centered on Atlanta, Orlando, and St. Louis are all Black women. In testimony before a state legislative committee considering the Georgia bill, Willis noted the proposal has emerged only after the number of county prosecutors who are racial minorities has recently nearly tripled in Georgia, to the point where they now oversee a majority of the state\u2019s population. \u201cI\u2019m tired and I\u2019m just going to call it how I see it,\u201d Willis told another group of legislators \u201cI, quite frankly, think the legislation is racist. I don\u2019t know what other thing to call it.\u201d The Black mayors of St. Louis and Jackson Mississippi have made similar charges. Hogan agreed the racial dimension of the conflict complicates the politics of the state efforts. But he believes those pushing preemption can rebut the charges of racism by pointing out that \u201cthe citizens of those cities and right now the folks who are suffering the most in the violence of those cities are the poor, minority citizens.\u201d Hogan likened the state efforts to preempt prosecutors to the movement for mandatory minimum sentences and federal sentencing guidelines that emerged after the 1960s to constrain sentencing decisions by judges that critics considered too lenient. Yet on balance, Hogan said he believes the red states are mistaken to seize control from local prosecutors and law enforcement as they are doing. Hogan argues that as in San Francisco\u2019s recall of Boudin, voters fed up with crime and urban disorder will eventually reject the progressive prosecutor movement. That would provide a more lasting shift, he maintainrf, because state \u201cattempts to jump in and cut off the democratic process\u201d will leave open the question of whether the progressive policies would have succeeded if left in place. \u201cPeople would be better off letting voters and reality make a correction here in the long run,\u201d Hogan said. Turner of the Vera institute, noting how many of the progressive prosecutors have won reelection, disputes the idea that their voters will reject the movement. But he also views the drive for more state control as \u201cprofoundly anti-democratic\u201d since it involves state legislatures overriding the choices of local voters to set criminal justice priorities for their communities. Roy likewise pointed out that the progressive prosecutors did not engage in a \u201cbait and switch\u201d but rather were elected after explicitly promising the shifts in direction that they are executing. In that way, she said, the red state legislatures, \u201care directly subverting what local communities are asking for.\u201d Exacerbating this conflict is the fact that in many red states GOP control of legislatures and governorships is rooted in their dominance of exurban, small town and rural areas far from the urban centers that are the targets of these preemption efforts. Severe gerrymanders that dilute urban influence compounds the challenge for the population centers in many of the states pushing preemption agendas. Trump has pledged to extend this preemption agenda to the national level. Beyond his call for Justice Department investigations of local prosecutors, Trump has said he will push legislation to authorize federal lawsuits against local district attorneys by anyone who claims they were harmed by their refusal to prosecute certain crimes. Perhaps most dramatically, Trump has repeatedly declared that in cities \u201cwhere there has been a complete breakdown of public safety, I will send in federal assets including the national guard until law and order is restored,\u201d as he put it in his recent speech to the CPAC convention. The push to seize more authority over criminal justice comes after a decade in which red states have dramatically expanded their efforts to tighten their control over blue cities on almost every front. Few areas of governmental authority now appear beyond the reach of preemption demands. \u201cIf you go back into the mid 2010s, a lot of the preemption was driven by business-it had to do with workplace equity, living wage, family leave, medical leave, and maybe some pollution-oriented regulations,\u201d said Briffault. \u201cThis stuff is all ideological now: crime, elections, schools.\u201d As the federal battle over the Washington, DC, criminal code reform showed, Republicans clearly feel they have the initiative in debates over crime, and Democrats are divided and ambivalent about how to respond. Against that backdrop, the safest prediction is that more Republican-controlled states will push to remove more authority over law enforcement and criminal justice decisions from big blue jurisdictions, most of them with large non-White populations. \u201cWe are in Georgia, we are in the South,\u201d said Griggs, the Georgia NAACP president. \u201cWe saw what they did in the \u201960s, in the \u201840s and \u201850s. So, there is no boundary.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump will travel to Iowa on Monday for the first time since announcing his third White House bid as Manhattan prosecutors near a decision on whether to charge him over his alleged role in a hush money scheme and cover-up. His visit to the crucial state \u2013 which hosts the first GOP contest of the 2024 nominating calendar \u2013 comes on the heels of trips by potential and announced primary challengers, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who made his Iowa debut on Friday, and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley, a declared candidate who also campaigned in the state last week. DeSantis, who is seen as Trump\u2019s chief potential rival for the Republican nod at this early stage of the campaign, doesn\u2019t plan to make a formal announcement on his political future until May or June. But his Iowa visit, which was followed by a stop Saturday in early-voting Nevada, sent a clear signal about his intentions. DeSantis moves his presidential ambitions into the open with Iowa visit In Davenport, Iowa, to promote his new book, DeSantis didn\u2019t mention Trump by name, but he contrasted his administration in Florida with the chaos and leaks that at times engulfed the Trump White House. \u201cThere\u2019s no drama in our administration,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cThere\u2019s no palace intrigue. (My staffers) basically just sit back and say, \u2018OK, what\u2019s the governor going to do next?\u2019 And we roll out and we execute.\u201d Trump is slated to deliver remarks Monday in Davenport focused on his 2024 education platform as well as trade, energy and agriculture, according to a person familiar with the speech. Education has become a political flashpoint and is expected to take center stage in next year\u2019s presidential election. Trump has called for cutting federal funding for schools that include \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content onto our children.\u201d He has suggested that parents select school principals through a \u201cdirect election\u201d process and has threatened to end federal funding for schools that teach \u201ca child that they could be trapped in the wrong body\u201d if he were to win another term. In Davenport, Trump is also expected to tout the $28 billion in federal aid his administration paid out to farmers who were hurt by his trade war with China as he tries to appeal to the key Iowa agricultural industry, the person familiar with the speech said. Ahead of his speech, Trump lashed out at DeSantis on his Truth Social platform over DeSantis\u2019 support as a congressman of a 2017 bill that would have ended a federal program that requires transportation fuel to contain a certain percentage of renewable fuels, including ethanol, a major industry in Iowa. But Trump\u2019s own record on ethanol is mixed. He received backlash from farmers when he was president after he granted waivers to small refineries temporarily exempting them from laws that require them to blend biofuels like ethanol into their gasoline. Leaders of corn grower organizations sent Trump a letter in response, saying the waivers had reduced demand for their crops. Trump\u2019s Iowa campaign stop follows an invitation by Manhattan prosecutors for him to appear before a grand jury, offering the clearest indication yet that a decision on charging him could come soon. The investigation relates to a $130,000 payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels in late October 2016, days before that year\u2019s presidential election, to stop her from going public about an alleged affair with Trump a decade earlier. Trump has denied having an affair with Daniels. Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s onetime personal attorney, met with members of the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office on Friday. Manhattan DA says 'focus is on the evidence and the law' in probe of Trump hush money scheme Trump would be the first former president ever indicted and the first major presidential candidate under indictment if charged. He remains defiant in the face of the Manhattan investigation and several other federal and state probes and has said he \u201cwouldn\u2019t even think about leaving\u201d the 2024 race were he indicted. At the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this month, Trump pledged to his supporters: \u201cI am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed: I am your retribution.\u201d As Trump\u2019s campaign operation and strategy begin to take shape, he announced his first team hires last month for the Iowa caucuses, who included Eric Branstad, son of former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and state Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, the son of Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann. Trump campaign officials know they have their work cut out for them in a state where a win or a loss could set the tone for the entire primary season. But Trump\u2019s team believes they will have an advantage over other 2024 hopefuls because of the data they\u2019ve collected on Iowans \u2013 both rallygoers and donors \u2013 during the dozens of times Trump has visited the state since the launch of his first presidential campaign in 2015. \u201cCaucuses are won by organization on a precinct level \u2013 it\u2019s identifying the people and then turning them out \u2013 and that\u2019s what we plan to do,\u201d one Trump adviser told CNN, adding that the team would be poring over that data in the coming months to identify potential Trump voters and their precincts and make sure their voter registrations are up to date. Trump criticizes evangelical leaders for not backing his 2024 presidential bid Trump will likely need to ramp up his outreach to evangelical Christian voters \u2013 who helped deliver the state for him in the 2016 and 2020 general elections \u2013 after lashing out earlier this year at religious conservatives who have declined to endorse his third presidential campaign \u201cNobody has ever done more for Right to Life than Donald Trump. I put three Supreme Court justices, who all voted, and they got something that they\u2019ve been fighting for 64 years, for many, many years,\u2019\u201d Trump told conservative journalist David Brody in a January podcast interview, referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of federal abortion rights in its Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization decision last summer. \u201cThere\u2019s great disloyalty in the world of politics, and that\u2019s a sign of disloyalty.\u201d Bob Vander Plaats, the president of the influential Christian group The Family Leader, told CNN that the 2024 political environment was different from that of 2016 and \u201cpeople are more interested in a vision for the future than a complaint about the past.\u201d \u201cThe people in the faith community are very grateful for Trump and his presidency but their loyalty is to one, and that\u2019s not Trump, it\u2019s to God,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just people of faith \u2013 Americans are looking to turn the page. There\u2019s a point where people are just exhausted with former President Trump.\u201d CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno and Kit Maher contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In a Republican Party now dominated by political pugilists, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin wants to the play the role of peacemaker. That, at least, was his message to voters Thursday night in a CNN town hall focused on public education. But Youngkin, whose 2021 victory in the commonwealth made him a national GOP star, was less inclined to discuss his other ambitions. He shrugged off a question about a potential 2024 presidential run and repeatedly turned down opportunities to pointedly distinguish himself from would-be rivals. The question now for GOP voters is whether they will continue to see Youngkin as a rising star or, given the early flow of the 2024 primary season, as an afterthought in a contest that has so far been dominated by former President Donald Trump, a declared candidate, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is likely on his way to entering the race. Still, there is no denying Youngkin\u2019s influence on GOP politics. His focus on education and \u201cparents\u2019 rights\u201d during his 2021 campaign has been copied by Republicans around the country, many seeking to parlay anger over Covid-19 shutdowns into a broader backlash against public educators and administrators. Like Youngkin, they have also attempted to package cultural clashes over race and gender identity as fights over the freedom of parents in educating their children. Here are some takeaways from Youngkin\u2019s town hall on Thursday: Youngkin may be treading the same political terrain as Trump and DeSantis, but during the town hall, like on the campaign trail in 2021, he packaged the message in less combative terms \u2013 a trait that could appeal to conservatives concerned that the current front-runners could be too divisive in a general election. Whether faced with tough questions on the handling of race in education or the treatment of transgender students, Youngkin was all smiles, all the time. He consistently attempted to defuse potentially tense exchanges with kind words and an insistence that the controversy at hand was not, in fact, all that controversial \u2013 a stance many Democrats and Republicans would likely reject. Youngkin also passed up the chance to use the national stage to aim any harsh criticism at President Joe Biden, who has been a staunch opponent of the policies championed by the governor and similarly disposed Republicans. But that decision \u2013 to sit back where his contemporaries lunge forward \u2013 was instructive. If Youngkin does enter the 2024 GOP primary, he may do so as the feel-good alternative to heavy hitters like Trump and DeSantis. Youngkin defended the executive order he signed last year banning \u201ccritical race theory\u201d from being part of public school curriculum, arguing that children should not be taught that \u201cthey are inherently biased.\u201d Critical race theory is based on the premise that racism is systemic in American society and is not the simple result of individual prejudice. According to CRT, racism is baked into institutions, laws, and policies that create and maintains racial inequities. The theory was not a part of Virginia\u2019s standard of learning but has become a frequent target for Republican leaders seeking conservative grassroots support. Youngkin said Thursday that his \u201ccritical race theory\u201d executive order was less important than other directives, including one that states that slavery was the cause of the Civil War. (This had long been a point of debate among historians and political leaders but is considered by many to be a settled point.) The executive order stated that \u201cinherently divisive concepts, including critical race theory\u201d should have no place in school curriculum. Youngkin\u2019s administration later created a tipline for parents to report on teachers who allegedly disobeyed it. (The system has since been shut down.) Schools, Youngkin said Thursday, should not \u201cteach that a child is guilty for sins of the past because of their race or religion or their sex\u201d or \u201cthat a child is a victim because of their race or religion or their sex.\u201d CRT, he argues, suggests just that. \u201cCRT isn\u2019t a class that\u2019s taught,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s a philosophy that\u2019s incorporated in the curriculum.\u201d Pressed by Tapper on how, under these constraints, teachers can explain that the present is a product of the past, Youngkin demurred. \u201cWe must teach all that,\u201d the governor said, before pivoting to a criticism of \u201ctoday\u2019s world of equal outcomes for all students at any cost.\u201d Youngkin has pushed a raft of new policies focused on transgender students. His administration\u2019s guidelines include a ban on trans students using bathrooms or competing on sports teams that do not match their sex assigned at birth. He has also required that parents sign off on the use of a gender pronoun different from what appears in a student\u2019s school record, among other similar steps. But in his CNN town hall appearance, Youngkin tried to minimize the new rules, which have been met with a backlash from transgender and equal rights advocates, arguing that his only goal is to \u201caccommodate\u201d as many students as possible and to guarantee parents\u2019 involvement in these \u201cdifficult decisions.\u201d \u201cSports are very clear. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s controversial. I don\u2019t think that biological boys should be playing sports with biological girls,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cThere\u2019s been decades of efforts in order to gain opportunities for women in sports, and it\u2019s just not fair.\u201d On the issue of restrooms, Youngkin again parried and pointed to past statements in which he suggested that \u201cwe just need extra (gender neutral) bathrooms in schools.\u201d And pressed by Tapper about what do in instances in which parents are not supportive of their trans children, Youngkin instead pointed to parents who he said have been locked out of their children\u2019s lives. \u201cChildren belong to parents,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cNot to the state, not to schools, not to bureaucrats, but to parents.\u201d Youngkin was questioned about what concrete measures Virginia is taking to protect students and staff following an incident earlier this year in Newport News, in which a 6-year-old boy allegedly shot his elementary school teacher. The governor argued that Virginia needs to focus on improving mental health resources rather than strengthening gun laws \u2013 saying that the commonwealth already has some of the \u201ctoughest gun laws in the country.\u201d \u201cWhat we continue to find is that those gun laws don\u2019t keep us safe. Because it\u2019s not laws that keep us safe. It\u2019s the behavior of people that we need to make sure that we\u2019re paying attention to. Parents have a responsibility to keep guns out of their young children\u2019s hands, and they need to be held accountable for that,\u201d Youngkin said. He then pointed to the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s toll on children\u2019s mental health and said it was important that Virginia move forward with an \u201caggressive transformation\u201d of its behavioral health system. Asked if he would strengthen the state\u2019s red flag law or require a safe storage measure, Youngkin said that Virginia already has such a measure in place and that requirements exist for parents to restrict access to firearms for children. \u201cThe reality is, if people don\u2019t follow the law, then the laws aren\u2019t as powerful as they otherwise could be,\u201d he argued. Youngkin said more Virginia schools should ban students and teachers from using ChatGPT, an AI-powered chatbot tool that could make it easier for students to cheat. \u201cI do think it\u2019s something to be very careful of, and I think more school districts should ban it,\u201d he told Tapper. Earlier this year, Fairfax County public schools in northern Virginia blocked ChatGPT from county-issued devices, according to WTOP News. School districts in New York City, Seattle and Los Angeles have also banned students and teachers from using ChatGPT on district networks and devices. The tool generates convincing responses and essays in response to user prompts. \u201cI think we should just be clear about what our goal of education is, which is to make sure that our kids can think,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cAnd therefore, if a machine is thinking for them, then we\u2019re not accomplishing our goal.\u201d Youngkin expressed support for legislation in Virginia that would have required the state\u2019s Department of Education to recommend policies about selecting and removing books from public school libraries. \u201cHad that bill passed, I would have signed it. And then we would have engaged with communities, not in a strong-handed way, but in an engaged way, to listen and discuss and make good decisions for our kids,\u201d he said. The legislation in question, House Bill 1448, was introduced in and passed by the Republican-led House of Delegates this year but was killed at the committee level in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Youngkin said Thursday that he wants to ensure that parents are aware of the books and materials in public libraries and in their children\u2019s curriculum. He pointed out that he signed a bill last year that requires schools to notify parents if instructional material contains sexually explicit subjects. \u201cI do believe there are moments where we have to make decisions about what\u2019s age-appropriate and what is appropriate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat books should be in an elementary school library? Should they have explicit pictures in them or not? Well, I don\u2019t think they should be there. And these are decisions that I think we should take on as opposed to run away from.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.",

            "article_content": "As president, Donald Trump made some of his most thoroughly dishonest speeches at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference. As he embarks on another campaign for the presidency, Trump delivered another CPAC doozy Saturday night. Trump\u2019s lengthy address to the right-wing gathering in Maryland was filled with wildly inaccurate claims about his own presidency, Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, foreign affairs, crime, elections and other subjects. Here is a fact check of 23 of the false claims Trump made. (And that\u2019s far from the total.) Crime in Manhattan While Trump criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has been investigating Trump\u2019s company, he claimed that \u201ckillings are taking place at a number like nobody\u2019s ever seen, right in Manhattan.\u201d Facts First: It isn\u2019t even close to true that Manhattan is experiencing a number of killings that nobody has ever seen. The region classified by the New York Police Department as Manhattan North had 43 reported murders in 2022; that region had 379 reported murders in 1990 and 306 murders in 1993. The Manhattan South region had 35 reported murders in 2022 versus 124 reported murders in 1990 and 86 murders in 1993. New York City as a whole is also nowhere near record homicide levels; the city had 438 reported murders in 2022 versus 2,262 in 1990 and 1,927 in 1993. Manhattan North had just eight reported murders this year through February 19, while Manhattan South had one. The city as a whole had 49 reported murders. The National Guard and Minnesota Talking about rioting amid racial justice protests after the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, Trump claimed he had been ready to send in the National Guard in Seattle, then added, \u201cWe saved Minneapolis. The thing is, we\u2019re not supposed to do that. Because it\u2019s up to the governor, the Democrat governor. They never want any help. They don\u2019t mind \u2013 it\u2019s almost like they don\u2019t mind to have their cities and states destroyed. There\u2019s something wrong with these people.\u201d Facts First: This is a reversal of reality. Minnesota\u2019s Democratic governor, Tim Walz, not Trump, was the one who deployed the Minnesota National Guard during the 2020 unrest; Walz first activated the Guard more than seven hours before Trump publicly threatened to deploy the Guard himself. Walz\u2019s office told CNN in 2020 that the governor activated the Guard in response to requests from officials in Minneapolis and St. Paul \u2013 cities also run by Democrats. Trump has repeatedly made the false claim that he was the one who sent the Guard to Minneapolis. You can read a longer fact check, from 2020, here. Trump\u2019s executive order on monuments Trump boasted that he had taken effective action as president to stop the destruction of statues and memorials. He claimed: \u201cI passed and signed an executive order. Anybody that does that gets 10 years in jail, with no negotiation \u2013 it\u2019s not \u201910\u2019 but it turns into three months.\u201d He added: \u201cBut we passed it. It was a very old law, and we found it \u2013 one of my very good legal people along with [adviser] Stephen Miller, they found it. They said, \u2018Sir, I don\u2019t know if you want to try and bring this back.\u2019 I said. \u2018I do.\u2019\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim is false. He did not create a mandatory 10-year sentence for people who damage monuments. In fact, his 2020 executive order did not mandate any increase in sentences. Rather, the executive order simply directed the attorney general to \u201cprioritize\u201d investigations and prosecutions of monument-destruction cases and declared that it is federal policy to prosecute such cases to the fullest extent permitted under existing law, including an existing law that allowed a sentence of up to 10 years in prison for willfully damaging federal property. The executive order did nothing to force judges to impose a 10-year sentence. Vandalism in Portland Trump claimed, \u201cHow\u2019s Portland doing? They don\u2019t even have storefronts anymore. Everything\u2019s two-by-four\u2019s because they get burned down every week.\u201d Facts First: This is a major exaggeration. Portland obviously still has hundreds of active storefronts, though it has struggled with downtown commercial vacancies for various reasons, and some businesses are sometimes vandalized by protesters. Trump has for years exaggerated the extent of property damage from protest vandalism in Portland. Russian expansionism Boasting of his foreign policy record, Trump claimed, \u201cI was also the only president where Russia didn\u2019t take over a country during my term.\u201d Facts First: While it\u2019s true that Russia didn\u2019t take over a country during Trump\u2019s term, it\u2019s not true that he was the only US president under whom Russia didn\u2019t take over a country. \u201cTotally false,\u201d Michael Khodarkovsky, a Loyola University Chicago history professor who is an expert on Russian imperialism, said in an email. \u201cIf by Russia he means the current Russian Federation that existed since 1991, then the best example is Clinton, 1992-98. During this time Russia fought a war in Chechnya, but Chechnya was not a country but one of Russia\u2019s regions.\u201d Khodarkovsky added, \u201cIf by Russia he means the USSR, as people often do, then from 1945, when the USSR occupied much of Eastern Europe until 1979, when USSR invaded Afghanistan, Moscow did not take over any new country. It only sent forces into countries it had taken over in 1945 (Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia 1968).\u201d NATO funding Trump said while talking about NATO funding: \u201cAnd I told delinquent foreign nations \u2013 they were delinquent, they weren\u2019t paying their bills \u2013 that if they wanted our protection, they had to pay up, and they had to pay up now.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that NATO countries weren\u2019t paying \u201cbills\u201d until Trump came along or that they were \u201cdelinquent\u201d in the sense of failing to pay bills \u2013 as numerous fact-checkers pointed out when Trump repeatedly used such language during his presidency. NATO members haven\u2019t been failing to pay their share of the organization\u2019s common budget to run the organization. And while it\u2019s true that most NATO countries were not (and still are not) meeting NATO\u2019s target of each country spending a minimum of 2% of gross domestic product on defense, that 2% figure is what NATO calls a \u201cguideline\u201d;  it is not some sort of binding contract, and it does not create liabilities. An official NATO recommitment to the 2% guideline in 2014 merely said that members not currently at that level would \u201caim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade.\u201d NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg did credit Trump for securing increases in European NATO members\u2019 defense spending, but it\u2019s worth noting that those countries\u2019 spending had also increased in the last two years of the Obama administration following Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea and the recommitment that year to the 2% guideline. NATO notes on its website that 2022 was \u201cthe eighth consecutive year of rising defence spending across European Allies and Canada.\u201d NATO\u2019s existence Boasting of how he had secured additional funding for NATO from countries, Trump claimed, \u201cActually, NATO wouldn\u2019t even exist if I didn\u2019t get them to pay up.\u201d Facts First: This is nonsense. There was never any indication that NATO, created in 1949, would have ceased to exist in the early 2020s without additional funding from some members. The alliance was stable even with many members not meeting the alliance\u2019s guideline of having members spend 2% of their gross domestic product on defense. We don\u2019t often fact-check claims about what might have happened in an alternative scenario, but this Trump claim has no basis in reality. \u201cThe quote doesn\u2019t make sense, obviously,\u201d said Erwan Lagadec, research professor at George Washington University\u2019s Elliott School of International Affairs and an expert on NATO. Lagadec noted that NATO has had no trouble getting allies to cover the roughly $3 billion in annual \u201cdirect\u201d funding for the organization, which is \u201cpeanuts\u201d to this group of countries. And he said that the only NATO member that had given \u201cany sign\u201d in recent years that it was thinking about leaving the alliance \u201cwas \u2026 the US, under Trump.\u201d Lagadec added that the US leaving the alliance is one scenario that could realistically kill it, but that clearly wasn\u2019t what Trump was talking about in his remarks on spending levels. James Goldgeier, an American University professor of international relations and Brookings Institution visiting fellow, said in an email: \u201cNATO was founded in 1949, so it seems very clear that Donald Trump had nothing to do with its existence. In fact, the worry was that he would pull the US out of NATO, as his national security adviser warned he would do if he had been reelected.\u201d The cost of NATO\u2019s headquarters Trump mocked NATO\u2019s headquarters, saying, \u201cThey spent \u2013 an office building that cost $3 billion. It\u2019s like a skyscraper in Manhattan laid on its side. It\u2019s one of the longest buildings I\u2019ve ever seen. And I said, \u2018You should have \u2013 instead of spending $3 billion, you should have spent $500 million building the greatest bunker you\u2019ve ever seen. Because Russia didn\u2019t \u2013 wouldn\u2019t even need an airplane attack. One tank one shot through that beautiful glass building and it\u2019s gone.\u2019\u201d Facts First: NATO did spend a lot of money on its headquarters in Belgium, but Trump\u2019s \u201c$3 billion\u201d figure is a major exaggeration. When Trump used the same inaccurate figure in early 2020, NATO told CNN that the headquarters was actually constructed for a sum under the approved budget of about $1.18 billion euro, which is about $1.3 billion at exchange rates as of Sunday morning. The Pulitzer Prize Trump made his usual argument that The Washington Post and The New York Times should not have won a prestigious journalism award, a 2018 Pulitzer Prize, for their reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 election and its connections to Trump\u2019s team. He then said, \u201cAnd they were exactly wrong. And now they\u2019ve even admitted that it was a hoax. It was a total hoax, and they got the prize.\u201d Facts First: The Times and Post have not made any sort of \u201choax\u201d admission. \u201cThe claim is completely false,\u201d Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email on Sunday. Stadtlander continued: \u201cWhen our Pulitzer Prize shared with The Washington Post was challenged by the former President, the award was upheld by the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review. The board stated that \u2018no passages or headlines, contentions or assertions in any of the winning submissions were discredited by facts that emerged subsequent to the conferral of the prizes.\u2019 The Times\u2019s reporting was also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.\u201d The Post referred CNN to that same July statement from the Pulitzer Prize Board. Awareness of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline Trump claimed of his opposition to Russia\u2019s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany: \u201cNord Stream 2 \u2013 Nobody ever heard of it \u2026 right? Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 until I came along. I started talking about Nord Stream 2. I had to go call it \u2018the pipeline\u2019 because nobody knew what I was talking about.\u201d Facts First: This is standard Trump hyperbole; it\u2019s just not true that \u201cnobody\u201d had heard of Nord Stream 2 before he began discussing it. Nord Stream 2 was a regular subject of media, government and diplomatic discussion before Trump took office. In fact, Biden publicly criticized it as vice president in 2016. Trump may well have generated increased US awareness to the controversial project, but \u201cnobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2 until I came along\u201d isn\u2019t true. Trump and Nord Stream 2 Trump claimed, \u201cI got along very well with Putin even though I\u2019m the one that ended his pipeline. Remember they said, \u2018Trump is giving a lot to Russia.\u2019 Really? Putin actually said to me, \u2018If you\u2019re my friend, I\u2019d hate like hell to see you as my enemy.\u2019 Because I ended the pipeline, right? Do you remember? Nord Stream 2.\u201d He continued, \u201cI ended it. It was dead.\u201d Facts First: Trump did not kill Nord Stream 2. While he did approve sanctions on companies working on the project, that move came nearly three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already around an estimated 90% complete \u2013 and the state-owned Russian gas company behind the project said shortly after the sanctions that it would complete the pipeline itself. The company announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming. And with days left in Trump\u2019s term in January 2021, Germany announced that it had renewed permission for construction in its waters. The pipeline never began operations; Germany ended up halting the project as Russia was about to invade Ukraine early last year. The pipeline was damaged later in the year in what has been described as an act of sabotage. The Obama administration and Ukraine Trump claimed that while he provided lethal assistance to Ukraine, the Obama administration \u201cdidn\u2019t want to get involved\u201d and merely \u201csupplied the bedsheets.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you remember? They supplied the bedsheets. And maybe even some pillows from [pillow businessman] Mike [Lindell], who\u2019s sitting right over here. \u2026 But they supplied the bedsheets.\u201d Facts First: This is inaccurate. While it\u2019s true that the Obama administration declined to provide weapons to Ukraine, it provided more than $600 million in security assistance to Ukraine between 2014 and 2016 that involved far more than bedsheets. The aid included counter-artillery and counter-mortar radars, armored Humvees, tactical drones, night vision devices and medical supplies. Biden and a Ukrainian prosecutor Trump claimed that Biden, as vice president, held back a billion dollars from Ukraine until the country fired a prosecutor who was \u201cafter Hunter\u201d and a company that was paying him. Trump was referring to Hunter Biden, Joe Biden\u2019s son, who sat on the board of Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. Facts First: This is baseless. There has never been any evidence that Hunter Biden was under investigation by the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who had been widely faulted by Ukrainian anti-corruption activists and European countries for failing to investigate corruption. A former Ukrainian deputy prosecutor and a top anti-corruption activist have both said the Burisma-related investigation was dormant at the time Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire Shokin. Daria Kaleniuk, executive director of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center, told The Washington Post in 2019: \u201cShokin was not investigating. He didn\u2019t want to investigate Burisma. And Shokin was fired not because he wanted to do that investigation, but quite to the contrary, because he failed that investigation.\u201d In addition, Shokin\u2019s successor as prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, told Bloomberg in 2019: \u201cHunter Biden did not violate any Ukrainian laws \u2013 at least as of now, we do not see any wrongdoing.\u201d Biden, as vice president, was carrying out the policy of the US and its allies, not pursuing his own agenda, in threatening to withhold a billion-dollar US loan guarantee if the Ukrainian government did not sack Shokin. CNN fact-checked Trump\u2019s claims on this subject at length in 2019. Trump and job creation Promising to save Americans\u2019 jobs if he is elected again, Trump claimed, \u201cWe had the greatest job history of any president ever.\u201d Facts First: This is false. The US lost about 2.7 million jobs during Trump\u2019s presidency, the worst overall jobs record for any president. The net loss was largely because of the Covid-19 pandemic, but even Trump\u2019s pre-pandemic jobs record \u2013 about 6.7 million jobs added \u2013 was far from the greatest of any president ever. The economy added more than 11.5 million jobs in the first term of Democratic President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Tariffs on China Trump repeated a trade claim he made frequently during his presidency. Speaking of China, he said he \u201ccharged them\u201d with tariffs that had the effect of \u201cbringing in hundreds of billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury from China. Thank you very much, China.\u201d He claimed that he did this even though \u201cno other president had gotten even 10 cents \u2013 not one president got anything from them.\u201d Facts First: As we have written repeatedly, it\u2019s not true that no president before Trump had generated any revenue through tariffs on goods from China. In reality, the US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries, and FactCheck.org reported in 2019 that the US generated an \u201caverage of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.\u201d Also, American importers, not Chinese exporters, make the actual tariff payments \u2013 and study after study during Trump\u2019s presidency found that Americans were bearing most of the cost of the tariffs. The trade deficit with China Trump went on to repeat a false claim he made more than 100 times as president \u2013 that the US used to have a trade deficit with China of more than $500 billion. He claimed it was \u201cfive-, six-, seven-hundred billion dollars a year.\u201d Facts First: The US has never had a $500 billion, $600 billion or $700 billion trade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US runs a surplus with China. The pre-Trump record for a goods deficit with China was about $367 billion in 2015. The goods deficit hit a new record of about $418 billion under Trump in 2018 before falling back under $400 billion in subsequent years. Trump and the 2020 election Trump said people claim they want to run against him even though, he claimed, he won the 2020 election. He said, \u201cI won the second election, OK, won it by a lot. You know, when they say, when they say Biden won, the smart people know that didn\u2019t [happen].\u201d Facts First: This is Trump\u2019s regular lie. He lost the 2020 election to Biden fair and square, 306 to 232 in the Electoral College. Biden earned more than 7 million more votes than Trump did. Democrats and elections Trump said Democrats are only good at \u201cdisinformation\u201d and \u201ccheating on elections.\u201d Facts First: This is nonsense. There is just no basis for a broad claim that Democrats are election cheaters. Election fraud and voter fraud are exceedingly rare in US elections, though such crimes are occasionally committed by officials and supporters of both parties. (We\u2019ll ignore Trump\u2019s subjective claim about \u201cdisinformation.\u201d) The liberation of the ISIS caliphate Trump repeated his familiar story about how he had supposedly liberated the \u201ccaliphate\u201d of terror group ISIS in \u201cthree weeks.\u201d This time, he said, \u201cIn fact, with the ISIS caliphate, a certain general said it could only be done in three years, \u2018and probably it can\u2019t be done at all, sir.\u2019 And I did it in three weeks. I went over to Iraq, met a great general. \u2018Sir, I can do it in three weeks.\u2019 You\u2019ve heard that story. \u2018I can do it in three weeks, sir.\u2019 \u2018How are you going to do that?\u2019 They explained it. I did it in three weeks. I was told it couldn\u2019t be done at all, that it would take at least three years. Did it in three weeks. Knocked out 100% of the ISIS caliphate.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s claim of eliminating the ISIS caliphate in \u201cthree weeks\u201d isn\u2019t true; the ISIS \u201ccaliphate\u201d was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump\u2019s presidency, in 2019. Even if Trump was starting the clock at the time of his visit to Iraq, in late December 2018, the liberation was proclaimed more than two and a half months later. In addition, Trump gave himself far too much credit for the defeat of the caliphate, as he has in the past, when he said \u201cI did it\u201d: Kurdish forces did much of the ground fighting, and there was major progress against the caliphate under President Barack Obama in 2015 and 2016. IHS Markit, an information company that studied the changing size of the caliphate, reported two days before Trump\u2019s 2017 inauguration that the caliphate shrunk by 23% in 2016 after shrinking by 14% in 2015. \u201cThe Islamic State suffered unprecedented territorial losses in 2016, including key areas vital for the group\u2019s governance project,\u201d an analyst there said in a statement at the time. Military equipment left in Afghanistan Trump claimed, as he has before, that the US left behind $85 billion worth of military equipment when it withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021. He said of the leader of the Taliban: \u201cNow he\u2019s got $85 billion worth of our equipment that I bought \u2013 $85 billion.\u201d He added later: \u201cThe thing that nobody ever talks about, we lost 13 [soldiers], we lost $85 billion worth of the greatest military equipment in the world.\u201d Facts First: Trump\u2019s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion \u2013 a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew. As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the \u201c$85 billion\u201d is a rounded-up figure (it\u2019s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces. A minority of this funding was for equipment. The Afghanistan withdrawal and the F-16 Trump claimed that the Taliban acquired F-16 fighter planes because of the US withdrawal, saying: \u201cThey feared the F-16s. And now they own them. Think of it.\u201d Facts First: This is false. F-16s were not among the equipment abandoned upon the US withdrawal and the collapse of the Afghan armed forces, since the Afghan armed forces did not fly F-16s. The border wall Trump claimed that he had kept his promise to complete a wall on the border with Mexico: \u201cAs you know, I built hundreds of miles of wall and completed that task as promised. And then I began to add even more in areas that seemed to be allowing a lot of people to come in.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Trump \u201ccompleted\u201d the border wall. According to an official \u201cBorder Wall Status\u201d report written by US Customs and Border Protection two days after Trump left office, about 458 miles of wall had been completed under Trump \u2013 but about 280 more miles that had been identified for wall construction had not been completed. The report, provided to CNN\u2019s Priscilla Alvarez, said that, of those 280 miles left to go, about 74 miles were \u201cin the pre-construction phase and have not yet been awarded, in locations where no barriers currently exist,\u201d and that 206 miles were \u201ccurrently under contract, in place of dilapidated and outdated designs and in locations where no barriers previously existed.\u201d Latin America and deportations Trump told his familiar story about how, until he was president, the US was unable to deport MS-13 gang members to other countries, \u201cespecially\u201d Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras because those countries \u201cdidn\u2019t want them.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s not true that, as a rule, Guatemala and Honduras wouldn\u2019t take back migrants being deported from the US during Obama\u2019s administration, though there were some individual exceptions. In 2016, just prior to Trump\u2019s presidency, neither Guatemala nor Honduras was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered \u201crecalcitrant,\u201d or uncooperative, in accepting the return of their nationals. For the 2016 fiscal year, Obama\u2019s last full fiscal year in office, ICE reported that Guatemala and Honduras ranked second and third, behind only Mexico, in terms of the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US.

            "article_content": "An alleged threat to kill Jewish government leaders in Michigan reflects two of the most dangerous, and interlocking, menaces in American politics and society \u2013 an alarming spike in antisemitism and escalating threats against elected officials. Police last month arrested a man accused of posting a Twitter threat to \u201ccarry out the punishment of death\u201d against anyone Jewish in the Wolverine State\u2019s government. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said on Thursday she was among those targeted. This is the latest example of a growing trend of intimidation and attacks targeting Jewish people at a time when extremists, who might once have been isolated, find affirmation and spurs to act from social media. The impact is horrific, not only for those directly targeted but for the wider Jewish community. Another Michigan lawmaker who was also allegedly targeted in the threat, state Rep. Samantha Steckloff, said that such incidents made her question her public service but that she felt a duty to fight for her community. \u201cPutting myself out there openly as a Jewish representative, when I have already received death threats on a daily basis, was one of the scariest things I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Steckloff told \u201cCNN This Morning\u201d on Friday. \u201cAnd I know even today, by showing my face, speaking out against this horrible tragedy that could have been, I am prone to some today.\u201d Only a few years ago, top American officials would bemoan rising antisemitism in Europe and question whether the lessons of the Holocaust were being forgotten: Now it\u2019s a growing and pernicious feature of US life that threatens the security and peace of mind of millions of citizens whom extremists want to ostracize as outsiders in their own country. Michigan AG says she was among those targeted in threat to kill Jewish members of state government In certain political and social media circles \u2013 sometimes fueled by celebrities \u2013 antisemitic rhetoric that was once taboo seems to be filtering into accepted discourse, alongside conspiracy theories like QAnon. It is hardly a coincidence that assaults, vandalism and harassment targeting Jewish communities and individuals in the United States have raced to their highest levels on record. And the consequences run much deeper than this inhumanity. History shows that antisemitism, which is attractive to unhinged conspiracy theorists, is often an early warning sign or a symptom of deepening threats to democracy. The latest spate of incidents targeting Jewish Americans coincides with unprecedented attacks on the integrity of elections and the public officials who administer them. It comes as right-wing commentators muse about \u201cGreat Replacement Theory,\u201d which posits that outsiders are coming to America to overwhelm its majority White population \u2013 a fantasy that has its roots in antisemitism but is now often applied to migrants. \u201cUnfortunately, whether it is in Michigan or other parts of the country, we are seeing the confluence of anti-government, Covid and other conspiracy theories combined with antisemitism, and we see how this is animating people to action,\u201d Oren Segal, vice president of the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League, said on CNN Thursday. \u201cIt is not only operating in spaces online but in the fantasies and imaginations of people who are willing to then take action.\u201d This is an age when political brutality isn\u2019t just some remote theoretical possibility. Ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s lies and incitement spilled over after the 2020 presidential election, when the US Capitol insurrection chillingly revealed that some Americans view violence as a legitimate tool to express their political grievances. The unrelenting lies about a stolen election, the currency that election deniers have on the right and the endless propaganda on conservative television curate a festering pool of anger that influences those who are tempted to act on their own anti-democratic grievances. The alleged threats against specifically Jewish officials in Michigan are only the most recent and high-profile example of a rising tide of antisemitism. Last month, San Francisco police arrested a man who allegedly made political statements and fired apparently blank rounds in a synagogue. Days earlier, a man allegedly threw a Molotov cocktail at a synagogue in New Jersey. In December, a 63-year-old man was assaulted in New York\u2019s Central Park in what police called an antisemitic attack. These were just the latest is a string of antisemitic incidents that included incendiary tweets from Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West, with whom Trump dined at Mar-a-Lago in November, alongside White supremacist Nick Fuentes. Also last year, demonstrators were spotted giving the Nazi salute and holding banners targeting Jews on a Los Angeles bridge. Shocking antisemitic messages were also projected onto buildings in Jacksonville, Florida. What my 10-year-old son innately understood about a simple way to combat antisemitism In 2018, a mass shooting at the Pittsburgh Tree of Life synagogue that killed 11 people stunned the nation. The year before, White supremacists converged on Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, \u201cJews will not replace us,\u201d in a march over which then-President Donald Trump equivocated. Scores more incidents failed to make national headlines but have had a corrosive and frightening impact on America\u2019s Jewish community. The Anti-Defamation League, in the latest available annual figures, found that a total of 2,717 antisemitic incidents were reported in 2021 \u2013 a 34% increase on the 2,026 incidents reported the year before. In the new case in Michigan, the FBI National Threat Operations Center told the Detroit FBI office that a person with the Twitter handle \u201ctempered_reason\u201d said he was heading to Michigan and \u201cthreatening to carry out the punishment of death to anyone that is Jewish in the Michigan govt.\u201d Any attempt to \u201csubdue\u201d him would \u201cbe met with deadly force in self-defense,\u201d the user said. Former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe said Thursday that the details of the alleged threats to Nessel and other officials underscored the increasing risks of political attacks motivated by antisemitism and extremism. \u201cThis is right in the wheelhouse of what the FBI and Director [Chris] Wray have told us. That \u2026 the most dangerous, the most concerning threat that they face on the counterterrorist side, and that is the threat from domestic violent extremists,\u201d McCabe said on \u201cCNN Newsroom.\u201d He added that such offenders were often \u201cmotivated by racial animus, they\u2019re motivated by antisemitic feelings, by anti-immigrant feelings, charged sometimes with political grievance and then motivated to act violently on their own.\u201d Even without the antisemitic dimension, the alleged threats to Nessel and other officials are a fresh example of Michigan\u2019s problem with political hate and extremism, though the state is far from alone in seeing its officials exposed to intimidation. In December, a federal judge sentenced one of the convicted leaders of a separate plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to nearly 20 years in prison. The man\u2019s lawyers argued he had descended down a \u201cconspiracy rabbit hole\u201d during long solo trips as a truck driver. Another Democratic state official involved in election administration, Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, has said armed protesters turned up outside her home to denounce her as a \u201ctraitor\u201d in late 2020 when Trump was pushing lies about a stolen election in the critical swing state. Outside Michigan, two Georgia election officials testified last year to the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection how verbal attacks on them by Trump and his aides had ruined their lives, with one saying, \u201cThere is nowhere I feel safe.\u201d In January, a Republican former candidate for New Mexico\u2019s legislature \u2013 who claimed there had been election fraud, according to police \u2013 was arrested on suspicion of orchestrating shootings that damaged the homes of Democratic elected leaders. And Paul Pelosi, the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is still recovering from a late October assault, allegedly by a man with a hammer who told police that Democrats had committed crimes against Trump, using rhetoric popular with the ex-president\u2019s supporters. Democrats are not the only victims of extremism. In 2017, Republican Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who now serves as House majority leader, was seriously injured in a shooting at a congressional baseball practice by a man claiming to be a Bernie Sanders supporter. And last year, police arrested a man near Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s home and charged him with attempting to murder the conservative Supreme Court justice. And as recently as Thursday, New Hampshire woman Katelyn Jones, 25, pleaded guilty to sending a series of threatening texts to a Michigan county election official after the 2020 election. She faces up to 10 years in prison when she is sentenced in July, according to the Justice Department. Each case is different, and individuals act on their own agency however they might be persuaded by heated political rhetoric. Politicians often use this to claim plausible deniability that their words caused violence. But the House January 6 committee aired video of Trump supporters on the day of the riot saying they were inspired by his false claims of election fraud. And a poll from The Washington Post and the University of Maryland in January 2022 found that 34% of Americans \u2013 and 41% of Republicans \u2013 think violent action against the government is sometimes justified. It is also undeniable that antisemitic attacks and violence and threats against public officials are coming at a time when the ex-president and his supporters have made false claims about stolen elections, which have been amplified by powerful media organizations like Fox News, even when \u2013 as emerged in court filings this week \u2013 the network\u2019s leaders knew those claims to be lies. Just this week, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who also has a record of spreading antisemitic material, showed up at a meeting on election integrity and berated Gabriel Sterling, a Republican election official from the Peach State who resisted Trump\u2019s baseless claims that he won the swing state in 2020. Greene fired off a flurry of claims and conspiracies for the cameras, which were almost all false. \u201cShe came in late. She purposely sat next to me because she wanted to get her social media hits,\u201d Sterling told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. Behavior like that often seen from Greene and Trump risks damaging democracy at its roots, since it comes with sometimes dangerous consequences for local public officials like Michigan\u2019s Nessel, who are critical to ensuring Americans can vote. \u201cIt\u2019s happening in almost every state. It\u2019s happening against regular people,\u201d said Rachel Kleinfeld, a senior fellow in the Democracy, Conflict and Governance Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cWho is willing to take these jobs?\u201d she asked, before warning: \u201cOur democracy is only as good as the people we elect, and we can only elect the people willing to run. And polling is showing that people are stepping back from running when they have to add this to a stressful job that doesn\u2019t pay particularly well and puts them in the literal targets of their fellow citizens.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Republicans have introduced a bill aimed at increasing so-called parental rights in the classroom, continuing to emphasize an issue that has emerged as a central party platform. Among other things, H.R. 5, also known as the \u201cParents Bill of Rights Act,\u201d would amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require schools to provide parents with a list of books and reading materials available in the school library as well as posting curriculum publicly. The proposed legislation also affirms parents\u2019 rights to address school boards and receive information about violent activity in their child\u2019s school. Republicans elevate 'parental rights' as top issue while looking to outflank each other heading into 2024 For Republicans, parental rights in education emerged as a significant political issue during the Covid-19 pandemic, when school closures, along with mask and vaccine mandates, upended family routines and renewed scrutiny over school leadership. But the issue really took off for Republicans after Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia\u2019s 2021 gubernatorial election following a campaign that placed \u201cparents\u2019 rights\u201d at its center. In some states, such as Texas, Florida and Iowa, parental permission is now needed to discuss certain topics with students. Other states, such as Georgia, have put parents and school communities in charge of vetting books their children could encounter at school for signs of race-related or sexual themes, appealing to conservatives who have voiced concerns about \u201cradical\u201d literature. \u201cI think the pandemic brought to light for a lot of us moms and dads, for the first time ever, we sat down and we saw what our children were being taught through the virtual classroom. And when we saw that, so many of us were disheartened with what we were viewing \u2013 and so then we did the right thing, right? We went to our school boards and voiced our displeasure, but we were turned away,\u201d Republican Rep. Julia Letlow of Louisiana, who sponsored the House legislation, said during a news conference on Wednesday. The bill has 73 GOP co-sponsors, she said. 'A form of resistance': More Black families are choosing to homeschool their children Similar legislation was introduced in the Senate last Congress by GOP Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, but it failed to be brought up for a vote. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy championed the new bill, calling it \u201cmilestone\u201d legislation, though it faces an uncertain future in the Democratic-led Senate. The proposed measure was swiftly denounced by Becky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, who said McCarthy is trying to stoke racial and social division. \u201cParents and voters agree that elected leaders should be focused on getting students the individualized support they need, keeping guns out of schools, and addressing educator shortages. But sadly, McCarthy would rather empower politicians who want to ban books and drive passionate educators out of the profession, instead of doing what is right for our students and public schools. Students, parents, and educators deserve better,\u201d Pringle said in a statement.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden could end up wielding the first veto of his presidency not on one of the great issues of state, but over a wonky skirmish sparked by the Republican Party\u2019s assault on what its culture warriors brand as \u201cwoke\u201d capitalism. Congress has sent to his desk a resolution overturning a Labor Department rule that allows managers of retirement funds to consider environmental and other factors when picking investments. The measure passed the Democratic-controlled Senate on Wednesday with the votes of all Republicans and two vulnerable Democrats. And now Biden has vowed to block it. The showdown might seem obscure, but it is a barometer of the kind of cultural backlash agenda that is certain to shape the tense politics of the next two years in divided Washington and in the Republican primary in the run-up to the 2024 presidential election. Senate votes to overturn Biden administration retirement investment rule Republicans decry as 'woke' The strategy is the latest front in the Republican Party\u2019s self-described war on \u201cwoke\u201d \u2013 in other words, their efforts to attack some climate change and social or racial equity policies that they believe will fire up their most conservative voters, many of whom fear their vision of American is under attack. The GOP is trying to define the next few years as a struggle between \u201cnormal or crazy,\u201d as Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders characterized the divide during her response to Biden\u2019s State of the Union address. The resolution Congress passed also shows how the GOP is increasingly unmoored from its role as the party of corporate America and Wall Street, as it seeks to weaponize the cultural anxieties of its most committed voters in red states. Investment firms had around $18 trillion in so-called Environmental, Social and Governance assets in 2021, according to PwC, which allow fund managers to make investing decisions based on such non-financial considerations. The GOP\u2019s assault on socially conscious corporations is being pioneered by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 contender who this week escalated his clash with the Walt Disney Company over its criticism of one of his laws that limits certain classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity for young children. The fact the anti-ESG measure made it to Biden\u2019s desk at all is one of the first illustrations of the delicate power balance in Washington given the new Republican majority in the House and the still fragile Democratic edge in the Senate. It passed the Senate by 50-46 on Wednesday with Democrats hurt by the absence of Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman, who is hospitalized for depression. Two other Democrats, Sens. Joe Manchin from West Virginia and Jon Tester from Montana, voted with Republicans, reflecting tough reelection races both are likely to face next year in states former President Donald Trump won by double digits. The resolution \u2013 which, unlike major legislation, only required a majority to pass \u2013 is likely to be the first of a flurry of Republican efforts to pass measures that have no chance of changing policy but that carry a hefty political message. Republicans argue that the Biden administration rule \u2013 which reverses an attempt by the Trump White House to prohibit the consideration of ESG factors in investing \u2013 would cost Americans financially by reducing the value of their investments, including 401k pension plans. GOP leaders also insist that investing based on environmental considerations could cost jobs in the fossil fuel industry, for instance. The Biden rule, however, does not require investment managers to make such decisions; it merely allows them to do so if they are relevant to risk and return analyses. While the differences between the Biden and Trump rules are intricate, the issue has blown up because it offers the GOP an opening to pivot to its broader claims that Democrats are trying to embed liberal political principles in vast sectors of government, business and everyday life. A lot of conservative 'churn' as Fox News is unmasked \u201cWhat\u2019s happened here is the woke and weaponized bureaucracy at the Department of Labor has come out with new regulations on retirement funds, and they want retirement funds to be invested in things that are consistent with their very liberal, left-wing agenda,\u201d Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso said on Tuesday. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky accused the administration of wanting to let \u201cWall Street use workers\u2019 hard-earned savings to pursue left-wing political initiatives.\u201d But Biden has warned that American workers should have the \u201cfullest set of available tools\u201d to maximize returns on their life savings and pensions. He said in a statement threatening a veto that the Trump-era rule got between investment advisers and workers and stopped plan managers from \u201cconsidering all factors relevant to investment decisions.\u201d If Biden vetoes the measure as expected, Republicans are certain to charge that he has capitulated to extreme left-wing influences in the Democratic Party. But Biden, adopting a populist tone, is criticizing the GOP measure for limiting American workers\u2019 earning potential from their savings. Democrats are also likely to charge that a far-right Republican Party is again demonstrating its cultural extremism and taking actions that could prejudice efforts to fight climate change and to foster racial equality. It is unlikely that there will be the sufficient two-thirds majority in the Senate and the House to overturn Biden\u2019s potential veto. There is one another candidate for Biden\u2019s first presidential veto. Republicans are working to rescind a controversial Washington, DC, crime law that they argue is soft on violent offenders. A final Senate vote on the measure is expected next week. Manchin has already said he\u2019d vote with Republicans, while Tester told reporters earlier this week he has not decided. The Republican campaign against \u201cwokeness\u201d is often hard to define and, in some cases, is a rhetorical device rather than a coherent set of policy programs. Often it is a mindset or definition that means different things to different people. But generally, it is employed by Republicans to target the belief that there are systemic injustices in US society \u2013 for instance, around race or sexuality \u2013 and policy responses to try to mitigate them. More broadly, as in the case of ESG investing, the GOP war on \u201cwoke\u201d policy is invoked to decry government or institutional efforts to make inclusionary or socially conscious decisions. In education, for example, Republicans often target the teaching of gender and sexuality issues that they think go against conservative values. DeSantis signs bill that gives him more control of Disney's special district Critics, however, often view such campaigns as attempts to create political wedge issues, which only end up hurting vulnerable individuals and groups. While attacks on \u201cwoke\u201d policies are allied to the ideology of Trumpism and his efforts to destroy government institutions, DeSantis has perfected the use of government power in what he\u2019s selling to conservatives as a defense of their values. Among multiple efforts, DeSantis has used state power to prevent fund managers from using ESG considerations in investment decisions. His new book, \u201cThe Courage to Be Free,\u201d which was published on Tuesday, bristles with countless references to \u201cwoke\u201d ideology. \u201cWoke capital exerts a pernicious influence on society in several ways. First corporations politicize the economy when they leverage their economic power to take positions on issues that do not directly affect their businesses,\u201d DeSantis wrote. The Florida governor also criticized what he sees as politicized companies that force employees to \u201cself-flagellate\u201d over concepts such as \u201cwhite privilege\u201d in diversity, equity and inclusion training. As Republicans in Congress pushed this campaign forward in Washington this week, DeSantis escalated his duel with Disney in Florida, giving him more power over its special tax district. Democrats have accused him of inappropriately using power in an act of personal and political revenge that pales in comparison with how he would use federal power if he ever makes it to the Oval Office.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Conservative Supreme Court justices took a predictably dim view Tuesday of President Joe Biden\u2019s controversial plan to forgive up to $20,000 in federal student loans for some borrowers and wipe away nearly half a trillion in debt. Biden announced the plan last August, just before the midterm election. He had been facing mounting pressure from Democratic lawmakers who called on the president to take executive action as it became clear Congress could not muscle through a more lasting proposal. Whether the debt forgiveness helped Democrats overperform in that election is up for debate, but the one-sided politics of the plan was a key sticking point for Supreme Court justices who have been skeptical of Biden\u2019s authority to do things without congressional approval. RELATED: Takeaways from the arguments One takeaway from Tuesday\u2019s hearing that surprised me: Justice Amy Coney Barrett sounded like a potential swing vote. The oral arguments were in two cases challenging the program: one brought by a group of Republican-led states and the other brought by two individuals who did not qualify for the full benefits of the forgiveness program. Many of the conservative justices were concerned with fairness, executive overreach and the mechanics of whether states could bring their suit. Why give borrowers this forgiveness instead of people who worked to pay off their debt early or were unable to take on debt and skipped college? Those are valid questions, and the idea of debt forgiveness splits the country in half. In national exit polling conducted for the 2022 midterm election, 50% of midterm voters, mostly Democrats, approved of Biden\u2019s debt relief plan, and 47%, mostly Republicans, opposed it. At arguments Tuesday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor was interested in the millions of people the potential debt forgiveness could affect. Many of them didn\u2019t have the same support lines during the pandemic that others had. \u201cThey don\u2019t have friends or families or others who can help them make these payments,\u201d she said. Those debtors will suffer in ways others won\u2019t because of the pandemic, she said. The most instructive story I read today on the underlying issue comes from CNN\u2019s Elise Hammond, who digs up data to view the problem of student debt. More than $1.6 trillion is owed, she writes, a compounding figure that has skyrocketed along with the cost of higher education. Taking on the debt is an investment, since graduates generally make more money than non-graduates. But debt can hound people for decades. Nearly a quarter of debt is owed by people age 50 and older. Biden's student loan forgiveness program remains blocked. Here are other ways to get debt relief Debt forgiveness is also an avenue to address racial inequality since Black graduates, in particular, tend to graduate with higher debt loads, making it harder for them to capitalize on their degree. Biden\u2019s proposal would be a big step, but is less complete than a congressionally approved program, and it would only take a bit out of the larger balance sheet and does nothing to address the root problem, which is the cost of college. Biden authorized up to $10,000 in federal debt forgiveness for most eligible borrowers and up to $20,000 total for borrowers who received a Pell grant while enrolled in college \u2013 which means the program is focused on people from lower-income backgrounds trying to break into the middle class. Interest in the forgiveness has been remarkable: These are people from every part of the country, a point the White House tried to make when it released a list of applicants by congressional district. Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out during arguments that something that\u2019s going to affect so many people and cost so much money should, to the casual observer, come from Congress. \u201cAnd if they haven\u2019t acted on it, then maybe that\u2019s a good lesson to say for the president or the administrative bureaucracy that it\u2019s not something they should undertake on their own,\u201d Roberts said. The administration points to 9/11-era legislation they say allows the secretary of education to take great power during a national emergency, in this case the pandemic. But justices have recently been skeptical of Covid-related emergency arguments. No matter what happens at the court, a pandemic-related pause on federal student loan payments that has been in place for nearly three years for all borrowers will be ending at some point. It\u2019s time to start budgeting for the return of those long-deferred loan payments. The Department of Education has said that regardless of the court\u2019s decision, payments will resume as soon as 60 days after the latest pause ends, on June 30, about the time the Supreme Court is expected to make its decision. That means loan payments could again be required as soon as late August. CNN\u2019s Aileen Graef talked to people with student debt who gathered outside the court Tuesday and filed this for CNN\u2019s live story on the arguments: Destiny Perry, a first-generation college student at Morgan State University in Baltimore, lives in a single-parent household of five. \u201cRight now, I have taken out a lot of loans. \u2026 I\u2019m out here trying to just go through college without having to stress about all the payments and everything else,\u201d Perry said. Perry said she explores scholarship opportunities to offset the debt, but she knows it will not be enough to graduate debt-free. Glen Lopez, a freshman at Morgan State, described his student debt as a \u201ccreeping feeling.\u201d He said that he thinks about the debt \u201cevery two to three days.\u201d Rep. Ayanna Pressley told CNN she knows about student debt from a personal perspective. \u201cWell, what I was sharing is a story that is certainly no anomaly. This is a systemic crisis \u2013 a nearly $2 trillion crisis burning people from every walk of life,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said. \u201cLike those millions of Black borrowers \u2013 and I was growing up in single-parent household \u2013 and given financial strain, I had no choice but to take out those loans. I ultimately defaulted on those loans and I did pay off those loans, but it took me 20 plus years to do so. And I was gainfully employed and often living check to check and I simply could just not make ends meet. I just could not get ahead,\u201d she said. In response to opponents\u2019 arguments that people should pay the loans they take out, Pressley said that \u201chardship is not a character flaw.\u201d \u201cAnd despite people\u2019s Herculean efforts working multiple jobs, given rising costs, people are treading water. They\u2019re treading water, and we can do something to alleviate this burden and this hardship,\u201d she said. There is a separate and extremely important question about whether the six Republican states as well as the two borrowers have \u201cstanding\u201d to bring the cases \u2013 meaning the legal right to bring the disputes in the first place. In fact, those states\u2019 residents would benefit from the forgiveness. CNN legal analyst Steve Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan that if the Supreme Court grants standing to the six red states, it has the potential to open up a new era of legal challenges in which states overload the legal system with challenges to any and all presidential actions. \u201cDoes their hostility to this program lead them to really weaken the historical limits on standing?\u201d That\u2019s an issue justices will have to grapple with, according to Vladeck, arguing they could also decide this is a political issue to be decided at the ballot box.",

            "article_content": "In pressing Republicans on Social Security and Medicare, President Joe Biden is reprising one of the most dramatic moments of his long career. During the 2012 vice-presidential debate, Biden engaged in a nearly 11-minute exchange with GOP nominee Paul Ryan over Republican plans to reconfigure the two massive programs for the elderly, several of which Ryan had authored himself. Biden and many Democrats felt he had won the argument on stage. Yet on Election Day, Ryan and GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney routed Biden and President Barack Obama among White seniors, and beat them soundly among seniors overall, exit polls found. That outcome underscores the obstacles facing Biden now as he tries to recapture older voters by portraying Republicans as threats to the two towers of America\u2019s safety net for the elderly. While polls consistently show that voters trust Democrats more than Republicans to safeguard the programs, GOP presidential nominees have carried all seniors in every presidential election back to 2004 and have reached at least 58% support among White seniors in each of the past four contests, exit polls have found. Democrats have likewise consistently struggled among those nearing retirement, older working adults aged 45-64. Those results suggest that for most older voters, affinity for the GOP messages on other issues \u2013 particularly its resistance, in the Donald Trump era, to cultural and racial change \u2013 has outweighed their views about Social Security and Medicare. Those grooves are now cut so deeply, over so many elections, that Biden may struggle to change them much no matter how hard he rails against a range of GOP proposals that could retrench or restructure the programs. Biden\u2019s charge that Republicans are threatening the two giant entitlement programs for the elderly \u2013 which triggered his striking back and forth exchanges with GOP legislators during the State of the Union \u2013 fits squarely in his broader political positioning as he turns toward his expected reelection campaign. As I\u2019ve written, the 80-year-old Biden, at his core, \u201cremains something like a pre-1970s Democrat, who is most comfortable with a party focused less on cultural crusades than on delivering kitchen-table benefits to people who work with their hands.\u201d As president he\u2019s expressed that inclination primarily through what he calls his \u201cblue-collar blueprint to rebuild America\u201d \u2013 the planks in his economic plans, such as generous incentives to revive domestic manufacturing, aimed at creating more opportunity for workers without a college degree. Politically, Biden\u2019s staunch defense of Social Security and Medicare, programs critical to the economic security of financially vulnerable retirees, represents a logical bookend to that emphasis. \u201cWe all know that whose side you are on is a critical debate point for every election and this debate over Social Security and Medicare really helps crystallize whose side Biden is on versus whose side Republicans are on in a very effective way for him,\u201d said Democratic pollster Matt Hogan, who helped conduct an extensive series of bipartisan polls during the 2022 campaign measuring attitudes among seniors for the AARP, the giant lobby for the elderly. From Franklin Roosevelt through Hubert Humphrey and Tip O\u2019Neill, generations of Democrats have framed themselves as the defenders of the social safety net for seniors against Republicans who they say would unravel it. Biden showed how comfortable he was stepping into those shoes during his 2012 vice-presidential debate with Ryan, then a young representative from Wisconsin who Romney had selected as his running mate. Nearly 30 years Biden\u2019s junior, Ryan was an unflinching advocate of restructuring Social Security and Medicare to reduce costs over time. In particular, Ryan was the principal supporter of a conservative plan to convert Medicare, the giant federal health insurance program for the elderly, into a system called \u201cpremium support.\u201d Under that proposal, Medicare would be transformed from its current structure, in which the government directly pays doctors and hospitals who provide care for beneficiaries, into a voucher (or \u201cpremium support\u201d) system, in which the government would provide recipients a fixed sum to purchase private insurance. Ryan had also drafted proposals to partially privatize Social Security by allowing workers to divert part of their payroll taxes into private investment accounts, a change that would have reduced the tax dollars flowing into the system and eventually required substantial cuts in guaranteed benefits. For nearly 11 minutes during the debate in October 2012, moderator Martha Raddatz of ABC skillfully guided Biden and Ryan through a heated, but civil and substantive, discussion of Social Security and Medicare\u2019s future. Ryan insisted that changes were needed to preserve the programs\u2019 long-term viability and that current seniors and those near retirement would not see their benefits reduced. Biden appealed openly to the Democrats\u2019 historic image as the programs\u2019 protectors and condemned Ryan and the GOP for wanting to partially privatize them. At one point in the debate, Biden declared: \u201cwe will be no part of a [Medicare] voucher program or the privatization of Social Security.\u201d A few moments later, he insisted: \u201cThese guys haven\u2019t been big on Medicare from the beginning. And they\u2019ve always been about Social Security as little as you can do. Look, folks, use your common sense. Who do you trust on this?\u201d At the time, Democrats felt Biden had at least held his own, restoring the party\u2019s momentum after Obama\u2019s surprisingly listless performance eight days earlier in his first debate against Romney. And Democrats through the rest of the campaign railed against the Republican ticket as a threat to Social Security and Medicare. But on election day, those arguments did not translate into gains for Obama and Biden among seniors or the older working adults (aged 45-64) nearing retirement. As Hogan noted, the newly passed Affordable Care Act, which generated some of its funding through savings in Medicare, was extremely unpopular at the time among older voters. Obama and Biden not only lost seniors and the older working age adults, but actually ran slightly more poorly among both groups in 2012 than they did in 2008. In fact, no Democratic presidential nominee since Al Gore in 2000 has carried most seniors in a presidential campaign; Obama in 2008 was the only one since Gore to carry most of the older working age adults. Among older Whites, the Democratic deficit is even more pronounced: the Republican presidential nominee has carried around three-fifths of both White seniors and those nearing retirement in each of the past four elections. Biden in 2020 slightly improved on Hillary Clinton\u2019s anemic 2016 performance with both groups, but still lost to Trump by 15 percentage points among White seniors and by 23 points among the Whites nearing retirement, according to the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN. Biden performed especially poorly among older Whites without a college degree \u2013 an economically stressed group heavily reliant on the federal retirement programs. Estimates by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, and the Pew Research Center likewise found that Trump in both 2016 and 2020 beat his Democratic opponents among both seniors and the older working adults. Like the exit polls, the Catalist data show the Republican nominees carrying about three-fifths of White seniors and older working adults in each of the past three presidential elections. The story is similar in congressional contests. In House elections, the exit polls found Republicans winning all seniors and older working adults comfortably in the 2014 and 2022 midterm campaigns and narrowly carrying them even in 2018 when Democrats romped overall. In all three of those midterm congressional elections, Republicans carried about three-fifths of the near retirement White adults, while they also reached that elevated threshold among White seniors in both the 2014 and 2022 campaigns. Republicans have maintained these advantages with older voters despite polls showing that most Americans trust Democrats more than the GOP to protect Social Security and Medicare, and that most Americans, especially seniors, oppose the intermittently surfacing GOP proposals to partially privatize both programs. Politically, \u201cDemocrats have used Social Security and Medicare really a lot over the past two or three decades, maybe four decades,\u201d said Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \u201cThe payoff has been a lot less than Democrats have generally thought it would be.\u201d Could this time be different for Biden and the Democrats? Congressional Republicans have certainly provided plenty of evidence for his claim that they still hope to restructure the programs. The proposed 2023 budget by the Republican Study Committee, the members of which include about three-fourths of House Republicans, reprises the ideas of converting Medicare into a premium support system and establishing private investment accounts under Social Security, while also raising the retirement age for both programs and reducing Social Security benefits over time. And although Florida Sen. Rick Scott renounced the idea late last week, his \u201cRescue America\u201d agenda did include a proposal to require Congress to reauthorize all federal programs, including Social Security and Medicare, every five years. These ideas have precipitated an unusual degree of open Republican dissension. Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly, and unreservedly, denounced the Scott plan until the Florida senator backed off. Trump recently released a video in which he declared the GOP should not cut \u201ca single penny\u201d of Social Security or Medicare benefits \u2013 which put him directly at odds with the three-fourths of House Republicans in the Republican Study Committee. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, bending more toward Trump\u2019s position, seems unlikely to incorporate into the GOP budget plans the RSC\u2019s most sweeping changes in Social Security and Medicare. Kessler believes Biden may succeed where other Democrats have failed at hurting the GOP with the issue, and he argued that the conspicuous Republican infighting demonstrates they share that concern. \u201cWe are watching a high-profile battle that I\u2019ve never really seen before on these issues in the Republican Party,\u201d Kessler said. \u201cAnd part of it is clearly they think it\u2019s a problem when they didn\u2019t years ago. If they think it\u2019s a problem, maybe it\u2019s a problem.\u201d Stuart Stevens, who served as Romney\u2019s chief strategist in the 2012 campaign but has since become a fierce critic of the Trump-era GOP, also believes the party could face more risk over its entitlement agenda than it did back then. The reason is that he thinks the idea of sunsetting Social Security and Medicare every five years, even if Scott is trying to jettison it, may prove more immediately tangible and understandable to voters than Ryan\u2019s complex ideas of partially privatizing both programs. \u201cThe question I always ask myself in campaigns is \u2018are you talking about something the other side doesn\u2019t want to talk about?\u2019\u201d Stevens said. \u201cThat\u2019s probably a good sign that they are losing on the issue.\u201d Whether Biden proves more effective than other recent Democrats at attracting older voters around Social Security and Medicare will likely pivot on whether seniors believe the GOP genuinely would cut the programs if given the power to do so, argued Robert Blendon, a professor emeritus at the Harvard School of Public Health, who specializes in public attitudes about the social safety net. \u201cIf the senior community actually believes that it\u2019s being threatened it really would affect their votes,\u201d he predicted. But, he added, \u201cas long as they are not threatened, the other values of seniors on top issues more and more correspond with Republicans.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt about the second half of that equation. Polling has consistently found that older Whites, in particular, are more receptive than their younger counterparts to hardline Trump-era GOP messages around crime, immigration and the broader currents of racial and cultural change: for instance, about half of Whites older than 50 agree that discrimination against Whites is now as big a problem as bias against minorities, a far higher percentage than among younger Whites, according to a new national survey by the Public Religion Research Institute. Older Whites are also more likely than younger generations to lack a college degree or to identify as Christians, attributes that generally predict sympathy for GOP cultural and racial arguments. Through the 21st century, those cultural and racial attitudes among older White voters have consistently trumped any concerns they may hold about the Republican commitment to Social Security and Medicare. Despite Biden\u2019s impassioned articulation of the case against the GOP, that didn\u2019t change even in 2012 when Republicans placed on their national ticket a vice presidential nominee who directly embodied the GOP aspirations to reconfigure and retrench those programs. Even small changes in seniors\u2019 preferences could have a big impact in closely balanced states with a large retiree population like Arizona and Pennsylvania. But the entrenched GOP advantage among older voters over the past two decades suggests Biden\u2019s hopes in 2024 may pivot less on improving with the \u201cgray\u201d than maximizing his vote among the \u201cbrown\u201d: the diverse, younger generations that recoil from the same Republican messages on culture and race that electrify so many older Whites.",

            "article_content": "The battle for control of the House of Representatives increasingly resembles a sporting event in which the teams are changing the dimensions of the playing field even after the game is underway. As many as a dozen or more states could redraw the lines governing their congressional elections again before the 2024 election, more than enough to shift the balance of power in a House where the two parties have only managed to eke out mirror image five-seat majorities over the past two elections. Experts agree it\u2019s unprecedented in modern times for this many House seats to remain in flux this long after the decennial redrawing of Congressional districts that last occurred following the 2020 Census. While it\u2019s not likely that all of these states will ultimately draw new lines, a combination of state and federal lawsuits and shifts in the balance of power in state legislatures and courts virtually ensure that an unusually large number of districts may look different in 2024 than they did in 2022, with huge implications for control of the House. \u201cIt\u2019s just trench warfare back and forth,\u201d says Kelly Burton, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, the leading Democratic group involved in congressional redistricting. The possibility that so many states could still reconfigure their House districts reflects the uncertainty looming over the political system as the Supreme Court considers momentous cases that will shape the future of voting rights challenges to congressional maps and the authority of state supreme courts to police partisan gerrymandering. \u201cWe are kind of all in a holding pattern until we determine what the Supreme Court does in those two cases,\u201d said Nick Seabrook, a University of North Florida political scientist and author of two books on the history of gerrymandering. Equally important, though, may be the growing determination of each party to scratch out every potential edge in the achingly tight battle for control of the House \u2013 an attitude that has encouraged both sides to fight in ways that neither even contemplated not too long ago. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is politics has gotten more competitive and closer, and the stakes are higher for all these constituents, all the old norms have just eroded,\u201d said former Republican Rep. Tom Davis, who served as chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThere are no rules anymore \u2026 and might makes right.\u201d In the civics textbook version, redistricting happens just once every ten years. The Census marks the shifts of population among the states; the number of congressional seats for each state is then reapportioned accordingly; and finally state legislatures or non-partisan commissions in some states draw new congressional districts that reflect population shifts within the states in time for the first election after the decennial Census. Those lines in theory then stay in place through the next Census eight years after that first election. In the modern era, though, more legal and political conflicts over redistricting are spilling over that traditional schedule. Overall, most experts agree the 2020 maps yielded a more equitable set of districts than the maps produced after 2010, when the GOP swept control of state governments in the \u201cTea Party\u201d election that year and used that power to impose severely gerrymandered maps in multiple states. \u201cThe maps are keeping the House competitive because they are more fair,\u201d says Burton. But the results of the unusually large number of extended re-redistricting fights, which Burton calculates could affect control of as many as 15-19 House seats, could change that verdict on the fairness of the 2020 process. Through the work of the NDRC (founded by Eric Holder, the attorney general for former President Barack Obama) and other groups, Democrats mounted a much more systematic effort to influence redistricting after 2020 than they did after 2010. But even so, Republicans now have the most reliable opportunities to gain seats from the ongoing process of re-redistricting, which could be critical in fortifying their narrow 222 seat majority in the House. The biggest shift could come in North Carolina, where a Democratic-majority state Supreme Court over recent years has repeatedly rejected congressional maps drawn by the Republican-controlled state legislature as partisan gerrymanders that violate the state constitution. Under the court\u2019s maps, Democrats split the state\u2019s 14 congressional seats 7-7 in last November\u2019s election. But in that election, Republicans won a majority on the state Supreme Court. As a result, local observers expect the GOP legislature (which has already petitioned the new court to overturn its earlier rulings) to impose a map that puts the GOP in position to win at least 10, and maybe 11, seats. \u201cThe Republicans will go as extreme as they can,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, chair of the politics department at Catawba College who writes a blog on North Carolina politics. \u201cThat would result in a swing of 4 seats to the Republicans in just this state.\u201d Likewise, a shift in the ideological balance of the state Supreme Court in Ohio could enable the Republican-controlled legislature there to draw new maps that allow the GOP to expand its current 10-5 advantage in the state\u2019s congressional delegation. From these two states alone, Republicans could gain as many as six more Congressional seats, calculates Kyle Kondik, managing editor for the Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball election newsletter of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. Against those nearly certain gains for the GOP in the re-redistricting process, the largest group of Democratic opportunities revolves around lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act challenging Republican gerrymanders. If Democrats and civil rights groups win those cases, Louisiana, Georgia and Alabama would be required to create one more district each favoring a Black candidate, and Texas could be required to create three districts or more favoring minority candidates. Lower courts have already ruled for the Democrats in the first three states. But the Georgia court did not order a new map, and in Alabama and Louisiana, the US Supreme Court blocked the lower court rulings and allowed the states to vote in 2022 under the disputed lines on the grounds that it was too close to the election to change them. Those rulings likely netted Republicans three seats in the 2022 election. Now the Supreme Court, in the case of Merrill v. Milligan, is deciding the underlying question of whether the Republican-drawn map in Alabama in fact violates the Voting Rights Act, a decision that will likely shape the outcomes in the other challenged states as well. The Republican-appointed justices have repeatedly weakened the VRA in a series of rulings over recent years, and many observers expect them to use the Alabama case to do so again. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem to me likely this Supreme Court is going to say \u2018go draw more Black districts in the south,\u2019\u201d said Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, and an expert on redistricting. Beyond the VRA lawsuits, Democrats are also pursuing other claims of racial bias in federal lawsuits against the district lines approved in South Carolina and Florida. But since the ultimate terminus for any federal litigation remains the GOP Supreme Court majority, those cases face uncertain prospects as well. With the Supreme Court limiting federal opportunities, Democrats are turning more to cases in state courts that challenge gerrymandered maps as a violation of state constitutions. \u201cState courts have proven to be surprisingly fertile territory for this,\u201d said Li. \u201cCourts in both Republican states and Democratic states have been willing to strike down maps from the party in charge.\u201d Through the last half of the 2010s, Democrats won four such state challenges to invalidate Republican-drawn congressional maps as unfair partisan gerrymanders in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Virginia. The University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics calculated that the new congressional maps the courts imposed netted Democrats an additional six seats in Congress; since Democrats emerged from the 2020 election with just a five-seat majority, those judicial interventions undoing Republican gerrymanders, the Center wrote, were probably enough to cost the GOP the majority at that point. Since 2020, state court interventions have cut both ways. In North Carolina, as noted above, the court blocked a GOP gerrymander; but state courts have also undone Democratic gerrymanders in Maryland and especially New York while refusing to intervene against an aggressive Florida gerrymander engineered by GOP Governor Ron DeSantis. Some observers believe there\u2019s a plausible case that control of the House flipped because a Democratic majority high court in New York overturned a gerrymander from its own party while a Republican majority high court in Florida did not. \u201cIf you look at the current [House] margin, almost all of that is Florida and New York,\u201d said Seabrook. Cases challenging congressional gerrymanders as violation of state laws are now pending in Florida, Utah and New Mexico (with the latter a challenge from Republicans.) In Arkansas, Democrats are pursuing both state and federal challenges to the congressional map. If Democrats win a majority of the state Supreme Court in a closely watched election in Wisconsin this spring, it\u2019s likely that a case will be brought there as well, said Ben Wikler, chair of the state Democratic Party. \u201cWisconsin is a 50-50 state represented by six Republicans and two Democrats in Congress,\u201d he said. Another wildcard is New York, where the Democratic-controlled top court (called the New York State Court of Appeals there) in a 4-3 decision last year rejected the legislature\u2019s congressional gerrymander and drew new maps that contributed to the GOP\u2019s unexpected gains across the state last fall. Now, though, the ideological future of that court appears up for grabs: Democrats in the state Senate appear likely to block Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s nomination of a conservative to fill a vacancy. If she ultimately appoints a more liberal judge, it\u2019s conceivable state Democrats might try to draw new lines again, some local observers believe; redrawing the lines in New York, in fact, might prove Democrats\u2019 best chance to offset the new seats Republicans will likely gain from re-redistricting in North Carolina and Ohio. Looming over the growing role of state courts to the redistricting battles is another hugely consequential Supreme Court case. In a North Carolina case (Moore v. Harper), the court could use the so-called \u201cindependent state legislature\u201d doctrine to limit or even bar state courts from overturning state legislatures\u2019 decisions on congressional maps (and other aspects of federal election administration.) Over the past decade, the GOP-appointed Supreme Court majority has already ended Justice Department preclearance of congressional maps (and other election rules) in states with a history of discrimination and ruled that federal courts cannot overturn maps on the grounds that they constitute unfair partisan gerrymanders. Now, between the Alabama case and North Carolina rulings, the GOP justices could seal off two of the remaining avenues Democrats have used to challenge gerrymandered congressional maps. \u201cThe outcome in both of these cases is likely to be bad for opponents of gerrymandering, either racial gerrymandering or partisan gerrymandering,\u201d said Seabrook. \u201cThe question is: how bad.\u201d The answer, for years to come, could determine control of a House of Representatives that now looks stuck on a knife\u2019s edge between the parties. But beyond the question of which party benefits if the Supreme Court continues to raze the guard rails against overly partisan maps is the impact on voters. Fewer restrictions on gerrymandering means more seats virtually guaranteed to elect candidates from one party or the other. In other words, more seats in which the politicians pick the voters rather than the other way around. \u201cThe alarming thing,\u201d said Davis, the former Republican representative \u201cis you are taking the voters out of the equation.\u201d",

            "article_content": "All eyes are on a number of top House Republicans, including Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, after Tuesday\u2019s speakership vote devolved into a drawn-out floor fight not seen in a century. The House adjourned until noon Wednesday after the chamber failed to elect a speaker in three rounds of voting. Scalise, the No. 2 House Republican, has been floated as a potential candidate for speaker if GOP leader Kevin McCarthy is still unable to secure the 218 votes needed to clinch the gavel.   CNN reported Monday that Scalise has made clear he backs McCarthy for the top job and GOP sources say he has rejected pleas by hardliners to mount a challenge to the California Republican. It remains unclear whether Scalise could even capture the support to win the speakership if McCarthy falters. He did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions Tuesday after the House adjourned when asked if McCarthy would drop out, what the next move for the party is, or whether he would accept the speakership if he gets the votes. Still, Scalise is widely expected to run for the job should McCarthy drop out of the race. Scalise, who most recently was House minority whip, has long been a deputy to McCarthy and is poised to inherit his former role of majority leader once the new Congress is seated. In a brief interview last month, Scalise said he wasn\u2019t going to discuss speculation on what he might do if McCarthy doesn\u2019t get the votes to become speaker. In 2018, he declined to pursue the position following Paul Ryan\u2019s retirement, citing his strong friendship with McCarthy. A New Orleans native, Scalise was a computer systems engineer when he decided to get involved in state politics in the mid-90s. He served as a state representative from 1995 until 2007 and as a state senator briefly afterward \u2013 all the while with his ambitions set on Washington. GOP dilemma: If not McCarthy, then who? He made moves for the 1st Congressional District seat in 1999 and again in 2004, only to step aside both times and defer to other high-profile Republican candidates such as Bobby Jindal, according to The Times Picayune. His time would finally come in 2008 after Jindal was elected Louisiana governor and resigned from the House seat. Scalise won the special election in May 2008, was later elected to a full two-year term and has cruised to reelection in the conservative district every election cycle since. In 2014, just as he was about to become the House whip for Republicans, Scalise faced intense blowback for having given a speech in 2002 to a White supremacist group founded by former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke. Scalise apologized and said in a statement that speaking to the group \u201cwas a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold.\u201d He survived the near-career ending scandal and was crucial to building support among Republicans for their legislative priorities as the whip. A shooting in June 2017, however, left him seriously wounded, with a grueling, months-long recovery process. Scalise was shot in the hip by a gunman who opened fire as congressional Republicans were practicing for an annual charity baseball game. \u201cA lot of people asked, \u2018Did this event change you?\u2019 And I think those of you who know me know I\u2019m an optimistic person. I\u2019m, you know, just a fun-loving person. I\u2019m from South Louisiana and we believe you work hard and you play hard and Joie de vivre,\u201d Scalise said in a September 28, 2017, speech \u2013 his first time returning to Capitol Hill following the shooting. \u201cIs an event like this going to really change that? And the first thing I can tell you is, yes, it changed me, but not in the ways you might think. It\u2019s only strengthened my faith in God. And it\u2019s really crystallized what shows up as the goodness in people. I got to see that goodness in people.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story originally ran November 23, 2022. It has been updated to reflect new data in two charts: Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema\u2019s party affiliation switch from Democrat to independent and updated race/ethnicity data for the 118th Congress from the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. A record number of women won election to the 118th Congress \u2013 but barely. The 149 women who will serve in the US House and Senate will expand the ranks of female representation by just two members above the record set by the 117th Congress. Alaska carried women across that threshold in November when the state determined through its ranked-choice voting system that Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, will represent the state\u2019s at-large House seat for a full term after winning the special election earlier in the year, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski won reelection. Women will break an overall record in the House, with 124 taking office in January. And not only will women of color break records in the 118th Congress, but within the House alone, there will also be a record number of both Latinas and Black women. Four more Latinas will serve in the House for a total of 18 \u2013 the most ever \u2013 and one more Black woman, bringing their total from 26 to 27. More than half of the incoming class of 22 freshman women in the House are women of color, showing the increasing diversity of that chamber. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a pretty steady increase in the racial and ethnic diversity of women as candidates, nominees, and then officeholders at the congressional level, but more specifically, in the US House,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, director of research at the Center for American Women and Politics at the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers. \u201cThat diversity is still hugely lacking in the US Senate. \u2026 We\u2019re seeing stasis there in terms of the number of women of color overall. The number of Asian and Latino women specifically will stay the same, and the number of Black women will stay the same at zero.\u201d Rep.-elect Sydney Kamlager of California is one of those new voices coming to the House. A state senator, she was elected to replace retiring Rep. Karen Bass, who will become the first female mayor of Los Angeles. Kamlager said while she is excited about the diversity of the freshman class, there is still a long way to go. \u201cI think folks have to stop giving lip service to Black women and brown women and put the money where the mouth is. The fact remains that Black and brown women face higher barriers of entry into this work than other women and men,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cWhen we run, our contributions are less oftentimes than men. We are held to higher and double standards,\u201d she added, noting that female candidates are still often asked why they are not \u201chome taking care of your husband or your children.\u201d \u201cFolks are OK with a mediocre male candidate but expect the female candidate to be off the charts,\u201d she said. Rep.-elect Yadira Caraveo, a Democrat, is the first Latina elected to Congress from Colorado. A state representative and the daughter of Mexican immigrant parents, she\u2019ll also be just the second female doctor who\u2019s a voting member of Congress. (The first, Democratic Rep. Kim Schrier, won reelection in Washington state.) \u201cKind of sad that it took until 2022,\u201d Caraveo said, reflecting on both milestones. Her experience in medicine and state politics, she said, prepared her for having to work harder to get \u201cless credit\u201d than her male counterparts. \u201cIt is, unfortunately, something that I\u2019ve seen throughout my time, both in medicine and in politics, and, sadly, a challenge that one gets used to, in some ways, but also, in other ways, continues to be painful,\u201d said Caraveo, a pediatrician. \u201cEven members of my staff, you know, as they came on board, really noted the different way in which I was treated or perceived as a woman of color compared to some of the other candidates that were able to more easily get meetings or support from different groups,\u201d she added. Still, the moment isn\u2019t lost on these women. \u201cIn Colorado, I didn\u2019t grow up seeing what I am now,\u201d said Caraveo. \u201cThe idea of being the first Latina \u2013 so not just that it\u2019s a woman but it\u2019s a woman of color \u2013 serving in Congress, I hope is going to be make things a little bit easier for the little girls that I\u2019ve taken care of in clinic. So that one day they don\u2019t have to talk about being first of something, their candidacy and their ability to be in office is just a given.\u201d And Caraveo, who will be representing a new district that Colorado gained in the reapportionment process, also stressed the significance of what more female representation could mean for legislating. \u201cThat sense of collaboration that we approach things with is very different than, I think, what my male counterparts often do,\u201d she said. On the other side of the aisle, Republicans will break a record with 42 women serving in Congress. Murkowski and Republican Sen.-elect Katie Britt of Alabama help bring the number of Republican women in the Senate to nine. And 33 Republican women will serve in the House next year, up from 32 this year. The incoming class of seven House Republican freshmen includes three Latinas, bringing the total number of Republican Latinas in the House to five. \u201cHaving the diversity of thought and experience is, you know, it\u2019s critical to our representative democracy,\u201d said Rep.-elect Erin Houchin, who noted that she\u2019s the first woman to represent her Indiana district. \u201cIt feels like we\u2019re accomplishing something for the next generation,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is meaningful for me in particular to set that example for my own daughters, for young women.\u201d Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur of Ohio has seen and beat plenty of records before as the longest-serving woman in the House. When she\u2019s sworn in for another term in January, on the heels of her first competitive reelection in years, she\u2019ll become the longest-serving woman in all of Congress, beating the record set by former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski. First elected in 1982, Kaptur has been sounding the alarm about her party being dominated by leadership from the coasts, while the heartland and industrial America \u2013 and its struggling middle class \u2013 is often forgotten in Washington. \u201cMy most heart-warming achievement is that the tenure represents a voice from the working class of people \u2013 who happens to be a woman,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Wes Moore, the incoming governor of Maryland, reflected Sunday on the historic nature of his election as the state\u2019s first Black chief executive. \u201cIt is remarkable,\u201d the Democrat said in an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d with Dana Bash, who pointed out that Maryland will also have a Black attorney general, treasurer and state House speaker. \u201cI\u2019m proud of the history that I\u2019m going to make in this race of being the state\u2019s first Black governor.\u201d \u201cAnd also I\u2019m proud of it because I know how complicated the racial history is in the state of Maryland and how complicated the racial history in the United States is,\u201d he said. \u201cMaryland is the state of Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglass, and Thurgood Marshall, but I also know that the reason that I am now days away from becoming Maryland\u2019s 63rd governor, is not only because Black folks voted for me.\u201d Moore, an Army veteran and former nonprofit executive, is only the third Black person to be elected governor in US history. He defeated Republican Dan Cox in November by 32 points in the deep-blue state. Meet the history-makers of the 2022 midterm elections Moore said people voted for him \u201cnot just because\u201d they wanted to see him make history, \u201cbut because they knew that together, we could actually build a state that everyone could believe in and everyone could thrive in.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a patriot and I was raised by patriots,\u201d said Moore, who served in Afghanistan. \u201cOur country is worth fighting for, but fighting for your country does not mean hating half of the people in it,\u201d Moore said. \u201cAnd when we talk about patriotism, it means an ability to be able to lift everyone up \u2013 to fight for each other, to believe in each other \u2013 to believe that our country is great because we are inclusive.\u201d Moore will succeed Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, who was term-limited and has been a critic of the hard-right direction his party has taken in recent years. \u201cI appreciate the fact that the governor \u2026 he was very against the MAGA movement from its inception \u2013 for years,\u201d Moore told Bash. \u201cHe\u2019s been calling the MAGA movement dangerous, which it is \u2026 and I thank him for that.\u201d Moore also said he doesn\u2019t foresee a White house bid anytime soon, instead throwing his support behind President Joe Biden in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m very excited for President Biden to run for reelection. We\u2019re going to support him. I\u2019m thankful for the amount of times he\u2019s come to Maryland. We have a lot of partnerships we\u2019re going to get done,\u201d he said. Moore pointed to work, wages, and wealth as three primary policy areas he wants to focus on in office. A rising Democratic star told his origin story. But did he allow a narrative to take hold that didn't match the facts? \u201cFor work, it means we\u2019re going to have an education system that is going to teach our students how not just to be employees but how to be employers,\u201d he said, noting that he has pushed a \u201cservice year option\u201d for every high school graduate in Maryland. If enacted, the state would be the first in the country to adopt such a program, which would provide job training and mentorship to young Marylanders. \u201cFor wages, it means that we are going to ensure that people can have good wages again for the jobs that they have because we still have too many people in this state that are working jobs \u2013 and in some cases \u2013 multiple jobs \u2013 and still living below a poverty line,\u201d he said. Moore also said he wants Maryland to lead the nation in tackling the racial wealth gap and \u201cmaking sure that people can own more than they owe.\u201d The incoming governor said that the best way to pay for state programs without raising taxes is to stimulate economic growth by introducing more job skill training to place people who are unemployed in open positions and offer child care to working parents. \u201cWe have a dynamic economy, we\u2019re just not preparing people to participate in that dynamic economy,\u201d he said. When asked by Bash if he was confident in his ability to implement state programs without raising taxes, Moore said, \u201cI\u2019m very confident.\u201d",

He is the author and editor of 25 books, including the New York Times best-seller, \u201cMyth America: Historians Take on the Biggest Lies and Legends About Our Past\u201d (Basic Books). Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Given the widespread availability of guns in this country and the hundreds of mass shootings that take place each year, many Americans are either haunted by the trauma of gun violence or fearful of the possibility that they or their loved ones could be the next victims. But the issue of gun control seems impossible to tackle due to the stark reality of partisanship in Washington. After the federal assault weapons ban expired in 2004, the gun industry seized on massive commercial opportunities to expand the sales of AR-15-style assault weapons. The number of deaths attributed to mass shootings has also significantly increased since the ban expired. Despite this, many Republican lawmakers have refused to adopt common sense measures that would curb the ability of citizens to purchase some of these weapons, bending instead to the gun lobby and segments of the electorate who consider these weapons sacrosanct. In fact, some Republicans are trying to make it easier to purchase guns. Just days after six people, including three children, were killed in an elementary school shooting in Nashville, Tennessee, state legislators in North Carolina overrode the governor\u2019s veto and made it legal to purchase a pistol without a permit. Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a likely 2024 Republican presidential candidate, visited a popular gun store in Cobb County, Georgia, on Thursday as part of his book tour. Despite these tone-deaf and counterproductive moves, Americans can\u2019t afford to be consumed by total despair and hopelessness when it comes to this issue. We must reject the notion that passing legislation is impossible. It is not. History shows that lawmakers have been capable of taking significant steps to strengthen the regulation of guns and pass gun control legislation at the federal and state levels. Opinion: Crumbley parents lose their appeal. Why that could be a game changer on school shootings In 1927, the Mailing of Firearms Act, also known as the Miller Act, prohibited Americans from sending concealed weapons through the US Postal Service. Rep. John F. Miller, a Republican from Washington, took action and an effective grass roots campaign garnered widespread support. While the law was limited in its scope \u2014 people could still legally send firearms through private mail carriers \u2014 it marked a breakthrough in federal legislative efforts. The National Firearms Act was passed in 1934, after Prohibition-era criminals adopted the use of the \u201cTommy Gun,\u201d one of the first portable and fully automatic firearms. The law imposed regulations and heavy taxes on certain firearms, including machines guns and sawed-off shotguns. The government also established a national registry to keep a record of sales. Four years later, Congress enacted the Federal Firearms Act of 1938. Interstate gun dealers were made to obtain licenses and maintain customer records. The law also banned the sale of weapons to certain Americans, including those who were convicted of felonies. The president of the National Rifle Association (NRA) even supported the bill. \u201cI have never believed in the general practice of carrying weapons,\u201d Karl T. Fredrick testified before Congress. \u201cI do not believe in the general promiscuous toting of guns. I think it should be sharply restricted and only under licenses.\u201d More modern regulations were instated after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in 1968. The Gun Control Act of 1968 expanded the rules on selling and importing firearms, prohibited certain individuals, such as convicted felons, from having guns and set the minimum age required to purchase a handgun at 21. \u201cThe government can help protect its citizens against the random and the reckless violence of crime at gunpoint,\u201d President Lyndon Johnson said upon signing the bill. And let\u2019s not forget, there have been modern Republican presidents who have agreed to more stringent federal controls as well. President Ronald Reagan \u2014 who survived an assassination attempt in 1981 \u2014 signed the Undetectable Firearms Act in 1988 that made it \u201cunlawful to manufacture, import, sell, ship, deliver, possess, transfer, or receive any firearm\u201d that could not be detected by a metal detector. Opinion: An often overlooked solution to prevent accidental gun deaths In 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed the Crime Control Act, which the Democrat-controlled Congress had passed to tightened restrictions on semi-automatic weapons. Three years later, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, named after Reagan\u2019s Press Secretary James Brady who was seriously wounded in the assassination attempt. The law imposed a five-day waiting period for purchases of handguns and required federally licensed dealers to run background checks on those purchasing a firearm. In 1994, Congress passed a federal ban on the manufacture, sale and possession of certain semi-automatic assault weapons. Former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter all supported the bill. \u201cThis is a matter of vital importance to the public safety,\u201d they wrote in a letter to members of the House. \u201cWhile we recognize that assault weapon legislation will not stop all assault weapon crime, statistics prove that we can dry up the supply of these guns, making them less accessible to criminals.\u201d The legislation, which passed in the wake of a series of horrendous shootings, was not perfect. There were loopholes, since the law did not ban all semiautomatic weapons and it had a sunset provision of 10 years. The Republican-controlled Congress allowed the law to expire (and in 2005 passed a law that shielded the gun industry from liability lawsuits). Nonetheless, numerous studies have shown that the assault weapons ban was successful during the 10 years it was in effect. There have been more federal legislation since then, including the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in 2022 which provided more funding for crisis intervention programs, mental health programs, and security in schools and imposed a number of new background checks and sales bans. A number of states have also taken the lead. California, New York, Illinois, Maryland and Colorado are just some of the states that put tougher measures in place in 2022. Opinion: Biden just took a stance against the middle class But there\u2019s plenty more work to be done. Many of the regulations that have been passed over the years were severely flawed. Some provisions have been dismantled, while other have been weakened as gun producers and buyers found ways around them. The gun lobby and manufacturing industry still rule the roost despite having weakened in recent years. The Second Amendment continues to be used as a bludgeon against new gun regulations despite many legal experts arguing that the founding fathers never intended to allow unfettered access to guns. But the Republican Party has fully aligned itself with a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and the partisan divide might be growing \u2014 the 2022 midterms were the first in 25 years where the NRA did not give any Democratic candidates a high ranking. With the filibuster in the Senate, Democrats have been unable to move forward with key measures that experts agree would be needed to meaningfully tackle this crisis. This has forced presidents such as Barack Obama to resort to executive action instead. In the end, breaking through the gridlock once again will require unyielding political pressure on elected officials. Members of Congress must continue to hear from the majority of Americans who do support stricter gun control. This must be an issue raised and highlighted every election cycle, and candidates should be forced to go on the record as to where they stand when it comes to the kind of weapons that are consistently used in mass shootings. The Parkland students who survived the 2018 shooting at their Florida high school created a template for this sort of action. The student courted the youth vote, organized rallies and protests in districts across the country, and capitalized on media attention to keep the issue on the front-burner. During the March on Washington in 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. famously spoke about the urgency of now. \u201cWe have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now,\u201d he said while standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial. \u201cThis is not time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.\u201d While King was talking about racial justice, the message that he delivered rings just as true today with regards to guns.  With mass shootings still occurring at an alarming rate, the nation is increasingly traumatized by gun violence. Young children today are now subject to active shooter drills and live with the very real fear that a mass shooting could take place in their schools, with guns surpassing car accidents as the leading cause of death for US children and teens. Despite this bleak reality, we must remember that federal and state legislative bodies can and have passed important gun control legislation. This history must be part of the national conversation.",

A graduate of Harvard Law School, he is a professor of public service at the Harvard Kennedy School and co-founded its Center for Public Leadership. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Traveling across the country in recent years, I discovered a sure way to fire up an audience: issue a call to young people for a year of service to others. \u201cIt\u2019s called national service,\u201d I tell people. \u201cSometime between the ages of 18 to 24 or so, we offer you an option to spend a year helping others \u2014 assisting teachers in classrooms, volunteering in a local hospital, reducing global warming and the like. For every year of service, you will receive not only a base salary, but you will also earn a scholarship to reduce future education debt.\u201d Audiences clap loudly.  They know from experience that spending a year or more in a military uniform often stiffens a spine and focuses the mind.  It is obvious to most folks that a year of domestic service can have a similar impact. Polling shows that Americans support national service. A 2017 Harvard Institute of Politics poll found that more than 60% of young Democrats and Republicans favored \u201ca national service program for Americans under the age of 25 that would be linked to student loan forgiveness or other relevant incentives.\u201d Around the world, dozens of countries require some form of service \u2014 a list that includes Denmark, South Korea and Israel. Yet, it has been nearly impossible to translate support for service into large-scale programs here in the United States. Presidents from George H.W. Bush to Bill Clinton to George W. Bush to Barack Obama have spoken warmly of service years but have never come close to implementing what other nations have pulled together. Every White House has had higher priorities. Partisanship gets in the way, idealism dims. Service years seem just out of reach. Until now! From the day of his massive election victory this past November, Wes Moore has emerged at the age of 44 to be one of the most promising young leaders in the country. Opinion: A rising star for the Democrats He is not only the first Black man to be elected governor of Maryland; he is the only third to be elected governor of any state in US history. More to the point, he is inspirational, recalling the early days of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. During his recent campaign, Moore often talked about the importance of service to others but it\u2019s hard during any campaign to evaluate how sincerely committed a candidate will be once in office. Well, Moore\u2019s inaugural address last week settled it: he is hugely serious.  While many details are still to be ironed out, he sent waves of excitement through social change agents  as he has pledged three major advances. It is a myth, Moore argues, to believe that the only path to success and fulfillment is to study at an elite university.  As Martin Luther King Jr. observed in a 1968 sermon, \u201cEverybody can be great\u2026 because everybody can serve.  You don\u2019t have to have a college degree to serve. You don\u2019t have to make your subject and verb agree to serve\u2026  You only need a heart full of grace, a soul generated by love.\u201d It was in that same spirit of service that Wes Moore signed up for the US Army at 17 and went on to lead combat troops in Afghanistan in the famous 82nd Airborne.  \u201cMy years of service transformed me,\u201d he said in his inaugural .  \u201cMy character was strengthened, my vistas were widened, my leadership was tested.\u201d \u201cA year of service will prepare young people for their careers \u2014 and provide our state with future leaders: public servants we desperately need.\u201d  No doubt, there will be distractions and disappointments ahead for the new governor, who is a Democrat.  His incoming administration has a long and demanding agenda on several fronts.  Maryland currently incarcerates more young Black men than any other state, according to a recent report from the nonprofit Justice Policy Institute, and has a racial wealth gap of nearly 8-1. But make no mistake, coming off his rousing inaugural and working with Republicans like Larry Hogan, his popular predecessor, Wes Moore has the potential to do something very special: turning Maryland into a national model for service and leadership.",

Air raid sirens are sounded across Ukraine earlier today as officials warned of potentially widespread Russian missile attacks. Explosions have been reported in the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia and the Kharkiv region, while threats of more strikes are being reported elsewhere in the country. Ukraine\u2019s main energy supply company introduced emergency power outages in the capital of Kyiv and neighboring regions in anticipation of the strikes, which have been repeatedly targeted at Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure. The attacks come a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky made a heartfelt appeal to lawmakers in Brussels to allow his country to become part of the European Union, insisting that Europe is Ukraine\u2019s \u201chome.\u201d The death toll in Turkey and Syria following the magnitude 7.8 earthquake has surpassed 21,000 people, marking a grim milestone as one of the top 10 deadliest quakes in the world over the past 20 years. A number of factors have contributed to making this earthquake so lethal. One of them is the time of day it occurred. With the quake hitting early in the morning, many people were in their beds when it happened, and are now trapped under the rubble of their homes. Additionally, a winter weather system is moving through the area and poor conditions have made reaching potential survivors difficult. More than 78,000 people have also been injured across the two countries in the quake, according to the latest data from authorities. Former Vice President Mike Pence has been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump and his role in January 6, 2021, a source told CNN. Specifically, the special counsel\u2019s office wants Pence to testify about his interactions with then-President Trump leading up to the 2020 election and the day of the insurrection. The subpoena marks a big milestone in the Justice Department\u2019s two-year criminal investigation into the efforts by Trump and allies to impede the transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. Depending on Pence\u2019s responses, prosecutors could ask a judge to compel him to answer additional questions and override Trump\u2019s executive privilege claims. The CDC has added Covid-19 shots to the list of recommended routine vaccines for kids and adults. \u201cThis means Covid-19 vaccine is now presented as any other routinely recommended vaccine and is no longer presented in a special \u2018call out\u2019 box as in previous years,\u201d an author of the report told CNN, saying the move will help \u201cnormalize\u201d the vaccine. However, including Covid-19 vaccines on the routine schedule does not mean vaccination will be required by schools or workplaces. School-entry vaccination requirements are determined by state or local jurisdictions, and not by the CDC. Key changes to the recommendations also include updated guidance for the flu as well as new vaccines for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and for hepatitis B. Meta on Thursday restored Donald Trump\u2019s Facebook and Instagram accounts, allowing him to once again post on the social media platforms. Trump\u2019s reinstatement comes weeks after Facebook\u2019s landmark announcement that it would restore his access following a two-year ban in the wake of the attack on the US Capitol. With his accounts reactivated, Trump will once again gain access to huge and powerful communications and fundraising platforms just as he ramps up his third bid for the White House. However, Meta has warned that guardrails have been installed on Trump\u2019s account that could result in it being suspended again if he breaks the company\u2019s rules. Twitter restored Trump\u2019s account in November, but he hasn\u2019t posted on the platform since.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s close presidential aide and speechwriter Stephen Miller returned to testify to a federal grand jury in Washington on Tuesday after the courts ordered that he and other top advisers must share their recollections of direct conversations with the then-president related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot. Miller is likely to be asked in the grand jury about his phone call with Trump minutes before the Ellipse rally that day, and other conversations they had about the election. The grand jury is hearing evidence as part of a special counsel\u2019s criminal investigation. Miller\u2019s appearance at the federal courthouse Tuesday morning \u2013 alongside his lawyer and prosecutors from the office of special counsel Jack Smith \u2013 adds to a parade of witnesses the 2020 election investigators have secured in recent weeks. Miller and his attorney declined to comment Tuesday. Late last month, the chief judge overseeing the grand jury denied Trump\u2019s attempts to protect his presidential communications from investigators, prompting witnesses like Miller, who previously avoided answering some questions, to testify again. Miller previously appeared before the grand jury in November. At that time, CNN reported that he declined to answer some questions because of Trump\u2019s wish to assert executive privilege and protect the secrecy of some of their conversations during his presidency. In his separate interview with House January 6 investigators, Miller declined to share details about conversations with Trump related to the then-president\u2019s unwillingness to concede the election if he lost and the discussions they had about speeches Miller prepared after the election, according to a publicly available transcript. The House investigation found that after the call between Miller and Trump the morning of January 6, Miller added in \u201cPOTUS edits\u201d to Trump\u2019s Ellipse speech that included a mention of then-Vice President Mike Pence having the ability to overturn the election result \u2013 a power Pence himself believed he didn\u2019t have. \u201cWe will see whether Mike Pence enters history as a truly great and courageous leader. All he has to do is refer the illegally-submitted electoral votes back to the states,\u201d the draft read. Another White House adviser then asked Miller to remove the Pence reference from the speech\u2019s text. Pence and Trump then had an angry phone call, and the speechwriting team reinserted a line about Pence. Criminal investigators from the special counsel\u2019s office have been pursuing questions about Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Pence, and they\u2019re securing testimony about it from a number of witnesses in recent weeks. Pence himself could testify as soon as this week. The grand jury proceedings are secret, and the special counsel\u2019s office hasn\u2019t filed any charges.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump has appealed a judge\u2019s order that Mike Pence must testify to a federal grand jury investigating the aftermath of the 2020 election, according to a person familiar with the case, but is unlikely to stop his former vice president from speaking to the panel. Trump has already lost several attempts in court to block other top officials from his administration from testifying, and the courts have resoundingly sided with grand jury pursuits for decades, making any attempt to claim executive privilege around his conversations with Pence a long shot. Over the past year, the grand jury in Washington has secured testimony from Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Patrick Philbin and Pence advisers Marc Short and Greg Jacob, following court decisions that Trump couldn\u2019t stop them from answering. In recent days, a lower-court judge also ordered that several of Trump\u2019s aides including then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows must testify despite Trump\u2019s attempts to assert privilege, and those former officials have either appeared again for testimony or are lined up to speak to the grand jury in the coming days. The decisions have set up a quick resolution for Pence\u2019s unprecedented testimony about the president he served alongside. \u201cFormer President Trump was always destined to lose all of these executive privilege challenges,\u201d Neil Eggleston, the former Obama White House counsel and one of the most experienced attorneys on presidential privilege issues in Washington, said this week. The Pence appeal follows the three other emergency appeals in the January 6, 2021, criminal probe and one related to a congressional investigation where Trump tried to protect documents from his presidency by claiming executive privilege. He has lost all of those challenges, with recent three-judge panels on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals refusing to block witness testimony sometimes within hours after he\u2019s asked for intervention. Adding to Trump\u2019s losing battle, Pence has said he would not appeal the judge\u2019s order from late March and would comply with his subpoena. He could be called before the grand jury as early as this week. Sealed filings in the DC Circuit related to Trump\u2019s appeal came in on Monday and do not indicate Trump is seeking any emergency intervention at this time, though one of his lawyers was spotted at the courthouse on Monday. Trump has continued to keep his legal challenges alive against the special counsel probe, even after he\u2019s lost in initial rounds and the witnesses have broken the secrecy bubble by testifying. But those appeals too appear to be losing battles, given how the emergency panels of judges have decided and how the cases have played out recently and in past presidencies. Even before investigation by special counsel Jack Smith pursued details of conversations between Trump and top administration officials, Trump lost a major court fight last year where he tried to hold off congressional investigators from obtaining his presidential records. \u201cUnder any of the tests advocated by former President Trump, the profound interests in disclosure \u2026 far exceed his generalized concerns for Executive Branch confidentiality,\u201d the DC Circuit Court of Appeals found in January 2022 during the House select committee\u2019s January 6 investigation. The same court \u2013 though different panels of three judges depending on the week \u2013 would handle all of the known Trump grand jury disputes and sits one rung lower than the Supreme Court. The court decisions on executive privilege related to the January 6 criminal probe are all still under seal, and the Supreme Court has not had to weigh in on any known January 6 grand jury challenge to date. In recent years, courts have considered the demands of criminal investigations even more sacrosanct than congressional investigations \u2013 making it harder for presidents to block grand jury demands when they are under investigation. Trump\u2019s ability to claim executive privilege after his presidency also hasn\u2019t been settled by the courts, and President Joe Biden has repeatedly declined to assert executive privilege over Trump-era presidential exchanges when January 6 investigators have requested access. On Sunday, James Trusty, one of Trump\u2019s defense lawyers, criticized the approach of the Justice Department. \u201cThey have literally put everybody in the grand jury you can imagine. They don\u2019t respect any privilege that President Trump holds,\u201d Trusty said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The courts determined almost 50 years ago during the Nixon presidency that presidential privilege could fall away when the grand jury\u2019s needs outweigh a presidential administration\u2019s calls for secrecy, Eggleston said. A unanimous landmark Supreme Court decision in 1974 that defined the parameters of executive privilege delivered the audio recordings of then-President Richard Nixon to the Watergate grand jury. \u201cAnyone who pays a filing fee can file anything they want,\u201d Eggleston added about Trump. \u201cI would be very surprised the court of appeals or the Supreme Court would be remotely interested in this issue\u201d because of how the courts decided during Watergate. Separate from Trump\u2019s executive privilege arguments, Pence had argued he should be covered by the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause, which shields lawmakers from certain law enforcement actions connected to their legislative duties and has been a thornier issue historically for the Justice Department to navigate in court. Chief Judge James Boasberg of the DC District Court decided Pence must testify about conversations where Trump may have been acting corruptly, but Pence could still decline to answer some questions related to January 6, when he was serving as president of the Senate for the certification of the 2020 presidential election. Pence claimed the court\u2019s decision as a win, because the trial-level judge allowed for the vice presidency to be covered by the same protections as members of Congress related to Pence\u2019s Senate duties. But the court\u2019s decision appears to preempt very little testimony in the January 6 investigation that the special counsel\u2019s office has sought.

            "article_content": "Former top national security officials have told prosecutors and testified to a federal grand jury that they repeatedly told former President Donald Trump and his allies that the government didn\u2019t have the authority to seize voting machines after the 2020 election, CNN has learned. Ken Cuccinelli, the former second in command at the Department of Homeland Security, was asked about discussions inside the administration around DHS seizing voting machines when he appeared before the grand jury earlier this year, according to three people familiar with the proceedings. Cuccinelli testified that he \u201cmade clear at all times\u201d that DHS did not have the authority to take such a step, one of the sources said. Cuccinelli\u2019s former boss at DHS, ex-acting secretary Chad Wolf, met with Justice prosecutors and FBI officials earlier this year after receiving a grand jury subpoena from special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team, according to Wolf\u2019s lawyer John Coale. Wolf told prosecutors that after the 2020 election he was asked by White House officials if DHS had legal authority to seize voting machines and each time he said no, Coale told CNN. Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien, in a closed-door interview with federal prosecutors earlier this year, also recounted conversations about seizing voting machines after the 2020 election, including during a heated Oval Office meeting that Trump participated in, according to a source familiar with the matter. Details about the secret grand jury testimony and closed-door interviews, neither of which have been previously reported, illustrate how special counsel Smith and his prosecutors are looking at the various ways Trump tried to overturn his electoral loss despite some of his top officials advising him against the ideas. Now some of those same officials, including Wolf, Cuccinelli and O\u2019Brien, as well as others who have so far refused to testify, may have to return to the grand jury in Washington, DC, to provide additional testimony after a series of pivotal court rulings that were revealed in recent weeks rejected Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege. Cuccinelli was spotted going back into the grand jury on Tuesday, April 4. Without that privilege shield, former officials must answer questions about their interactions and conversations with the former president, including what he was told about the lack of evidence for election fraud and the legal remedies he could pursue. Special counsel is locked in at least 8 secret court battles in Trump investigations That line of questioning goes to the heart of Smith\u2019s challenge in any criminal case he might bring \u2013 to prove that Trump and his allies pursued their efforts despite knowing their fraud claims were false or their gambits weren\u2019t lawful. To bring any potential criminal charges, prosecutors would have to overcome Trump\u2019s public claim that he believed then and now that fraud really did cost him the election. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of ways you can show that. But certainly one of them is if they were told by people who knew what they were talking about, that that there was no basis to take the actions,\u201d said Adav Noti, an election law attorney who previously served in the US Attorney\u2019s Office in Washington, DC, and at the Federal Election Commission\u2019s general counsel\u2019s office. \u201cI would not want to be a defense lawyer trying to argue, \u2018Well, yes, my client was told that, but he never really believed it,\u2019\u201d Noti said. Inside the Trump White House after the 2020 election, the push to seize voting machines eventually led to executive orders being drafted in mid-December of that year, directing the military and DHS to carry out the task despite Wolf and Cuccinelli telling Trump and his allies their agency did not have the authority to do so. Those orders, which cited debunked claims about voting system irregularities in Michigan and Georgia, were presented to Trump by his former national security adviser Michael Flynn and then-lawyer Sidney Powell during a now-infamous Oval Office meeting on December 18. Smith\u2019s team has asked witnesses about that meeting in front of the grand jury and during closed-door interviews, multiple sources told CNN. Among them was O\u2019Brien, who told the January 6 House select committee that he was patched into the December 18 meeting by phone after it had already devolved into a screaming match between Flynn, Powell and White House lawyers, according to a transcript of O\u2019Brien\u2019s deposition that was released by the panel. O\u2019Brien told the committee that at some point someone asked him if there was evidence of election fraud or foreign interference in the voting machines. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018No, we\u2019ve looked into that and there\u2019s no evidence of it,\u201d O\u2019Brien said he responded. \u201cI was told we didn\u2019t have any evidence of any voter machine fraud in the 2020 election.\u201d When asked about that meeting by federal prosecutors working for Smith, O\u2019Brien reiterated that he made clear there was no evidence of foreign interference affecting voting machines, according to the source familiar with the matter. O\u2019Brien met with prosecutors earlier this year after receiving a subpoena from Smith\u2019s team and is among the Trump officials who could be called back to discuss conversations with Trump under the judge\u2019s recent decision on executive privilege. Former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, who personally told allies of the former president that there was no evidence of foreign election interference or widespread fraud that would justify taking extreme steps like seizing voting machines, must also testify, the judge decided. A spokesperson for Ratcliffe did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Wolf declined to comment. Cuccinelli acknowledged to the January 6 committee last year that, after the election, he was asked several times by Trump\u2019s then-attorney Rudy Giuliani, and on at least one occasion by Trump himself, if DHS had authority to seize voting machines. Wolf told the committee he was repeatedly asked the same question by then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Giuliani, who was subpoenaed by the Justice Department before Smith took over the investigation, previously acknowledged to the January 6 committee that he participated in that December 18 Oval Office meeting and other conversations about having DHS and the military seize voting machines. Newly obtained surveillance video shows fake Trump elector escorted operatives into Georgia county's elections office before voting machine breach Giuliani told congressional investigators that he and his team \u201ctried many different ways to see if we could get the machines seized,\u201d including options involving DHS, according to the transcript of his committee interview. Giuliani also acknowledged taking part in conversations \u2013 even before the Dec. 18 Oval Office meeting \u2013 where the idea of using the military to seize voting machines was raised. \u201cI can remember the issue of the military coming up much earlier and constantly saying, \u2018Will you forget about it, please? Just shut up. You want to go to jail? Just shut up. We\u2019re not using the military,\u2019\u201d he added. Robert Costello, an attorney for Giuliani, told CNN that Giuliani has not received a subpoena from Smith. Costello said that in early November, Giuliani was subpoenaed by the DC US Attorney seeking documents and testimony. Costello says he told the Justice Department Giuliani couldn\u2019t comply with the given deadlines because they were in the middle of disciplinary proceedings at the time. That was the last time Giuliani heard from DOJ, says Costello. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a word since November 2022,\u201d Costello told CNN on March 30. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story reported that Chad Wolf had appeared before a federal grand jury. After publication Wolf\u2019s attorney told CNN that Wolf met with Justice Department prosecutors and the FBI after receiving a grand jury subpoena from special counsel Jack Smith but has not yet testified before the grand jury itself.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team has lost a bid for emergency help from the federal appeals court in Washington, DC, to block some of his closest advisers from testifying about him to a grand jury, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to a new court filing. Trump\u2019s team on Monday night asked for the appeals court to wipe away a lower court\u2019s ruling that would force several of his top advisers to answer questions to a grand jury investigating Trump and his allies\u2019 attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, despite his claims of legal protections around his presidency that would shield some of their testimony. The appeals court denied his request on Tuesday, dealing Trump another legal setback just before he is set to enter a courtroom in Manhattan to face criminal charges in a separate investigation. The swift decision means advisers to Trump, including Meadows, could be brought into the federal grand jury in Washington by prosecutors in the coming days. Trump would need a court to intervene in his favor in order to block their subpoenas. By early Tuesday afternoon, prosecutors from the special counsel\u2019s office who are focused on January 6-related cases already had brought former Homeland Security acting secretary Ken Cuccinelli back to the grand jury. Cuccinelli previously testified to the grand jury in Washington in January. Overnight, a panel of three judges on the appeals court \u2013 Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Greg Katsas \u2013 had sought a response from the Justice Department regarding Trump\u2019s request. The Justice Department responded about two hours later. An appeal on the larger legal questions around executive privilege assertions could still live on before the appeals court, but the activity around Trump\u2019s emergency request for a stay would determine now if witnesses must comply with Justice Department subpoenas and the lower court\u2019s decision against Trump. Trump\u2019s team is unlikely to ask the Supreme Court for help, one source told CNN. A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to a request for comment. The case is sealed and Trump and the Justice Department are not named in the filings. The Biden administration has repeatedly declined to assert executive privilege for the presidency related to Trump\u2019s actions around January 6, 2021, when issues like these came up in previous situations. Other witnesses who may be affected by the ruling include Trump\u2019s former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, former national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien and several Trump White House advisers such as Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino. CNN has confirmed some of the witnesses previously testified to the grand jury, but may have declined to answer some questions at Trump\u2019s direction. Special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s team is seeking grand jury testimony from these senior Trump aides as part of the wide-ranging criminal probe into Trump\u2019s post-election actions in 2020 and the January 6, 2021, insurrection. Last week, Trump went to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals to challenge the underlying ruling in the case, from DC District Court Judge Beryl Howell in March. But on Monday, two of Trump\u2019s defense lawyers, Evan Corcoran and James Trusty, visited another district court judge who now oversees grand jury proceedings, Chief Judge James Boasberg, to ask for a pause on the case, the source said. He denied their request, prompting the Trump team to go to the appeals court seeking emergency help, according to the source. The ruling from Howell ordering Meadows and others to answer questions was one of the last in her tenure as chief judge of the DC District Court, and added to a pile of losses for Trump as he has tried unsuccessfully to block federal prosecutors from obtaining testimony in the January 6, 2021, and Mar-a-Lago criminal investigations. Separately, Boasberg recently decided former Vice President Mike Pence would need to testify in the same investigation. Trump has lost repeatedly in court on executive privilege claims, with the Justice Department able to overcome presidential secrecy because of the grand jury investigation needs. While Trump\u2019s team has criticized the prosecutorial steps as overreach, the court\u2019s decisions are in line with what criminal investigations have been able to achieve dating back to the Watergate investigation.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump is appealing a court ruling that would force several of his former aides, including Mark Meadows, to answer questions before a grand jury as part of the criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The mid-March ruling from US District Judge Beryl Howell, who was then the chief judge of DC\u2019s federal trial court, is one of several defeats the former president has suffered in his efforts to use executive privilege claims to block the testimony of former aides and allies in the Justice Department\u2019s special counsel investigations. In another recent ruling, Howell\u2019s successor, Chief Judge James Boasberg, rejected Trump\u2019s executive privilege challenge to a subpoena for former Vice President Mike Pence. The judge did give Pence some protections under a constitutional clause aimed at shielding legislative activities from certain law enforcement actions. It is unclear if any of the parties will appeal Boasberg\u2019s ruling. Last year, former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy, Patrick Philbin, appeared for additional questioning in front of the grand jury after Trump lost an apparent executive privilege challenge aimed at their appearance. Trump\u2019s latest appeal is aimed at a Howell decision ordering a constellation of former Trump aides to give grand jury testimony. Among them, sources previously told CNN, are former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, former national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien and former Department of Homeland Security official Ken Cuccinelli. Howell\u2019s ruling also rejected Trump\u2019s privilege claims for multiple former members of his White House, including his ex-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, his senior adviser Stephen Miller and top communications aide Dan Scavino. Howell\u2019s order was issued under seal, and the litigation that preceded it also played out in secret.

            "article_content": "For all the frenzy over a possible indictment of Donald Trump in a New York hush money case, the ex-president\u2019s gravest legal issues, which are deepening by the day, may lie elsewhere. Three crushing legal blows against Trump and his lawyers in investigations conducted by special counsel Jack Smith threaten to expose with fresh clarity his conduct in the run up to the US Capitol insurrection and his hoarding of classified documents. In an extraordinary development revealed on Tuesday, a federal judge opened the way to a former vice president testifying against the president he served. In a ruling still under seal, the judge said Mike Pence must appear before a grand jury over conversations he had with Trump leading up to January 6, 2021. Such an appearance would allow prosecutors to seek potentially damning evidence, under oath, about fierce pressure Trump imposed on Pence to thwart the transfer of power to President Joe Biden. The ruling came days after another court decision against Trump and for the January 6 investigators, saying he could not block grand jury testimony from some of his administration\u2019s top officials, including then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. These rulings came amid another win for the special counsel last week when Trump\u2019s lead defense attorney, Evan Corcoran, testified again to the grand jury after he was ordered to reappear by an appeals court. Corcoran could potentially have vital evidence related to whether Trump deliberately hid classified documents or sought to obstruct authorities trying to get them back. Each development potentially peeled away another layer of protection from the former president, who has not been charged with a crime in any of the cases. Both probes being pursued by Smith are succeeding in overcoming Trump\u2019s time-worn strategy of postponing accountability with spurious litigation and vast and questionable claims of executive and attorney-client privilege that nevertheless take time to litigate. And while any charges over January 6 could be complex and might require prosecutors to use rarely tested concepts, a potential obstruction charge in the documents case could be far easier to bring. \u201cIt is interesting to me that there is this scrum over the New York case, but I really do believe that in particular, the Mar-a-Lago case, the potential obstruction of justice case, puts (Trump) in the greatest jeopardy right now,\u201d said former federal Judge John Jones III, who is now president of Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. It is impossible to know what is going on inside the grand jury or the special counsel\u2019s case. But Corcoran was told by the court he could no longer withhold information about communications he had with Trump leading up to the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago last year. He was also ordered to turn over his attorney notes. Corcoran was in a perfect position to know how Trump was responding to government efforts to get documents back and could shed light on any intent to obstruct the federal government. There is also a clear sense that the documents case may be approaching a decisive moment. \u201cI think there\u2019s some pressure now on Justice to bring this to a conclusion. To me, based on the way it is shaping up, it is a dead bang obstruction of justice case,\u201d Jones said, underscoring that a case against Trump might be made not just for the mishandling of classified material but for possible false statements to the government about such documents. New York grand jury won't hear Trump case again this week. Here's the latest in the investigation The latest adverse developments for Trump in the January 6 and Mar-a-Lago cases came with the ex-president still waiting in the investigation led by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg centering on a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels in 2016. Trump had wrongly predicted earlier this month that he\u2019d be arrested last week and called for protests. Sources familiar with the proceedings said that the grand jury hearing the case would not consider it again this week, adding fresh intrigue to the anticipation that has built after Trump\u2019s initial statement. On Monday, in a possible sign that prosecutors were trying to solidify their case, the grand jury heard from David Pecker, the former head of the company that publishes the National Enquirer. He was a key player in negotiating the payment in an alleged scheme that previously landed Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, in jail. On yet another legal front, a prosecutor in Fulton County, Georgia, said at the end of January that charging decisions were \u201cimminent\u201d in an investigation into his efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the crucial swing state in November 2020. CNN reported last week that prosecutors are considering bringing racketeering and conspiracy charges. Trump has vehemently denied wrongdoing in all the cases. And he has wriggled free of dicey legal and political predicaments before with an almost mythical capacity to evade accountability for behavior that would have doomed any conventional politician. But his potential vulnerability and the sheer breadth of investigations against him is brewing a moment of unprecedented stress for the country\u2019s political and legal institutions. Not only is Trump apparently in severe jeopardy of becoming the first former president to be indicted, but his campaign to return to the White House in 2024 \u2013 while potentially being criminally charged \u2013 raises the possibility of an extraordinary political uproar. Trump is already fanning the flames of a situation that would be guaranteed to exacerbate the country\u2019s extreme political polarization. At a campaign rally in Texas last weekend, the ex-president folded various probes against him into a single false conceit: that the Biden administration is seeking to weaponize the justice system against him to steal the 2024 election. The big development on Monday concerned Pence, who is also mulling a 2024 White House bid. Prosecutors appear to want the former vice president to flesh out testimony of some of his senior aides and White House officials about Trump\u2019s pressure on him to block the certification of Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. Pence insists he has nothing to hide. But his lawyers argued that his testimony should be limited by the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause because of his role as president of the Senate. The doctrine is supposed to protect the separation of powers, and Pence effectively argued that it barred the executive \u2013 including the Justice Department \u2013 from forcing him to speak before the grand jury about his congressional duty. But in a sealed judgment that threaded a legal needle, Chief Judge James Boasberg of the US District Court in Washington, DC, found that Pence must testify to the grand jury about conversations he had with Trump in the run up to January 6, multiple sources familiar with the ruling said. But the judge also said Pence can still decline to answer certain questions related to his role on January 6, when his official role as president of the Senate was to preside over the certification of Biden\u2019s election victory. The ruling was a fascinating development for its multiple legal and constitutional implications. It\u2019s unclear for now at least which exact questions Pence could decline to answer under oath. On the face of it, this is a partial victory for Pence and a win for Smith \u2013 and a loss for Trump. It could play into Pence\u2019s political ambitions. As he considers a run for the GOP presidential nomination against Trump, he could use the cover of a court ruling to show up at a grand jury appearance many observers believe was inevitable but that GOP voters may find objectionable. Although, the former vice president has now broken so completely with his ex-boss \u2013 and by extension a large chunk of the GOP base \u2013 that he may also have a political interest in contributing to the investigation\u2019s knowledge of Trump\u2019s maneuvering before January 6. But he could also blur the legal technicalities by arguing that he stood up to the Biden administration\u2019s Justice Department \u2013 a potentially useful weapon in a GOP presidential debate. And he may have even clarified and expanded the scope of the office of the vice presidency in establishing new interpretations on the Speech or Debate Clause. The latter question would still need to be enshrined by eventual appeals court or Supreme Court consideration of Speech or Debate Clause cases to be considered definitive, however. Pence said on Tuesday that he was considering his next steps, and there is no sign yet when he might testify to the grand jury. \u201cThe requirements of my testimony going forward are a subject of our review right now, and I\u2019ll have more to say about that in the days ahead,\u201d Pence told Newsmax\u2019s Greta Van Susteren. The potential impact of Pence\u2019s testimony is unknown. After all, some of Pence\u2019s closest former aides have already testified to the grand jury. They also spoke to the House select committee on January 6 in the previous Congress in testimony that was later aired publicly. Pence declined to appear before that panel under the Democratic-led House. The former vice president also said in his recently published book that he asked his general counsel for a briefing on the procedures of the Electoral Count Act after Trump, in a December 5, 2020, phone call, \u201cmentioned challenging the election results in the House of Representatives for the first time.\u201d But after the special counsel\u2019s latest victory, he will be keen to lock down Pence\u2019s retelling for investigators, ahead of any potential indictment. And only Pence can give full details of any private conversations or calls with Trump. He might be able to provide fresh evidence about whether Trump was committing a crime by pressuring him to overturn the election, for instance. Whatever happens, when Pence finally goes before the grand jury, he is likely to provoke the already boiling fury of Trump.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge has ordered several former Donald Trump aides, including Mark Meadows, to testify before a grand jury as part of the criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election, rejecting the former president\u2019s claims of executive privilege, multiple sources confirmed to CNN. Trump\u2019s legal team had challenged subpoenas issued by special counsel Jack Smith demanding testimony and documents from Meadows, the former president\u2019s White House chief of staff, as well as several others by asserting executive privilege. Trump attorney appears before grand jury in Mar-a-Lago classified documents probe In a sealed decision last week, then-Chief Judge Beryl Howell rejected the Trump team\u2019s claims of privilege for Meadows and other top Trump administration officials who were subpoenaed by Smith, including former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, former national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien and former Department of Homeland Security official Ken Cuccinelli, sources told CNN. Trump\u2019s privilege claims for other former White House aides, including Stephen Miller and Dan Scavino, also were rejected, the sources said. Trump\u2019s legal team is expected to appeal the decision, one source familiar with the matter said. ABC News first reported the ruling. Some of the witnesses who have already appeared before the grand jury but refused to answer some questions related to their interactions with Trump will now likely have to return. A Trump spokesperson slammed the decision in a statement, accusing the Justice Department of \u201ccontinuously stepping far outside the standard norms in attempting to destroy the long accepted, long held, Constitutionally based standards of attorney-client privilege and executive privilege.\u201d Opinion: Why Trump's choice to rally in Waco sends a dangerous signal \u201cThere is no factual or legal basis or substance to any case against President Trump. The deranged Democrats and their comrades in the mainstream media are corrupting the legal process and weaponizing the justice system in order to manipulate public opinion, because they are clearly losing the political battle.\u201d O\u2019Brien and Cuccinelli recently appeared before the grand jury after receiving subpoenas as part of Smith\u2019s probe. The investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election ahead of the January 6, 2021, attack at the US Capitol is one of two ongoing probes overseen by special counsel Smith. It is separate from the state-level criminal investigation in Georgia related to efforts by Trump and his allies to upend the 2020 election results there and another in New York centered around the former president\u2019s alleged role in hush money payments to an adult film star. Smith also oversees the criminal probe stemming from the discovery of classified documents recovered from Trump\u2019s Mar-a-lago residence. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s legal limbo appeared to get more precarious on Wednesday. The country gets closer every day to a political and judicial precipice that could see a former president indicted for the first time ever. The ex-commander in chief\u2019s 2024 White House bid would make this historic twist even more inflammatory and amount to his greatest stress test yet of America\u2019s legal and governing institutions and its brittle unity. And Trump is not just confronting a single case of potentially criminal vulnerability. New developments on multiple fronts suggest it\u2019s possible he could be indicted in several separate investigations that are all apparently moving forward in a long-delayed crescendo of possible accountability. A fateful national moment is brewing amid Trump\u2019s wild rhetoric and predictions of his own arrest, a political storm whipped up by his allies, and anticipation among those who have long chafed at his flair for impunity. Your Trump questions answered. Yes, he can still run for president if indicted An increasingly circus-like atmosphere in Washington, New York and Florida, where Trump now lives, is making the drama around the various cases even more tense and confusing \u2013 and, to some extent, taking the focus away from what may be a moment of dubious history. And a mounting partisan uproar led by House Republicans, meanwhile, appears designed to blur the facts, distract from the evidence and fuel Trump\u2019s claim he\u2019s the victim of an endless political vendetta. Trump, who denies any wrongdoing, is yet to be charged in any of the cases and there\u2019s no certainty he will be. But the pattern of recent days appears to show the legal clouds around him darkening. \u2014 On Wednesday, his problems deepened when an appeals court ruled that Trump\u2019s defense attorney, Evan Corcoran, must testify before a grand jury in the case surrounding classified documents that Trump ferreted away at his resort at Mar-a-Lago. The ruling, which came with surprising speed and thwarted Trump\u2019s typical monthslong delaying tactics, was so significant because the Justice Department had to convince the court there was sufficient evidence to show Trump committed a crime in order to puncture the convention of attorney-client privilege. Norm Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and CNN legal analyst, said the piercing of this bedrock legal protection was highly unusual and an ill omen for Trump, since Corcoran\u2019s testimony could be used to suggest he committed a crime. This could involve not just the mishandling of classified documents but also possible obstruction of justice. \u201cIt considerably worsens what was probably Trump\u2019s most federal legal peril,\u201d Eisen told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Wednesday. Notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023 \u2014 This development came with all eyes on New York after expectations soared this week that Trump could soon face indictment in a distinct case arising from an alleged scheme to pay hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election. Intrigue spiked after the grand jury in the matter did not meet on Wednesday. But it will sit on Thursday, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN\u2019s John Miller. There are signs that one witness could be asked to reappear. And sources told CNN that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has been under fierce attack from Trump\u2019s GOP allies, was also taking a moment to regroup amid the furor. Miller reported that Bragg\u2019s team is working out whether to call back a pivotal witness \u2013 Trump\u2019s former lawyer, Michael Cohen \u2013 to refute testimony this week by Robert Costello, an attorney who previously represented several Trump allies and appeared before the grand jury at the request of Trump\u2019s legal team. Cohen, who made the payment to Daniels, is seen by some analysts as a weak link in any trial since his credibility could be undermined by his own conviction for lying to Congress. CNN legal analyst Elliot Williams explained that Bragg would have to test the question of Cohen\u2019s trustworthiness now before a grand jury or at trial. \u201cIt\u2019s very much in their interests, to take a beat, step back and decide,\u201d he said. \u201cThis kind of thing happens all the time, as prosecutors decide whether and how to bring cases.\u201d There have been increasing indications an indictment could be near, especially since Trump predicted over the weekend, inaccurately, that he would be arrested this past Tuesday. But the possible charges in this yearslong and somewhat obscure case could center on business violations or infringements of campaign finance law. All of which raises the question of whether it\u2019s truly in the national interest to cross the Rubicon of charging a former president in a case that may be hard to explain to the public, lacks profound constitutional implications and may not be a slam dunk at trial. \u2014 In a third Trump legal entanglement, Fani Willis, the district attorney of Fulton County, Georgia, said in January that charging decisions were imminent in an investigation into the ex-president\u2019s attempt to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory in the critical swing state. Willis\u2019 office, which is considering bringing racketeering and conspiracy charges, could make decisions this spring, CNN reported on Monday. In a Hail Mary move, Trump\u2019s lawyers have tried to get a court to throw out the special grand jury\u2019s final report. \u2014 And on yet another separate legal front, the ex-president and his lieutenants are being investigated by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith over his attempts to steal the 2020 election and over the US Capitol insurrection. In another sign of the seriousness of the probe, Smith has subpoenaed former Vice President Mike Pence, who helped save US democracy on January 6, 2021, to testify. (Smith is also investigating Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents.) Amid the turmoil, the ex-president \u2013 between angry hits on his social media network Truth Social \u2013 is playing a waiting game with advisers, who are preparing for several different scenarios involving a possible indictment in New York, CNN\u2019s Kristen Holmes reported. At times, Trump has celebrated because he thinks an indictment could supercharge his campaign but has also complained it would be \u201cunfair.\u201d Characteristically, the former reality show star and New York tabloid fixture has toyed with the idea of creating a media spectacle if he is charged, Holmes reported. Underscoring one thread of the political drama that could ensue, Trump\u2019s potential biggest rival in the 2024 Republican primary chose this week to twist the knife while other potential GOP White House contenders were rushing to Trump\u2019s defense in the hush money case. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told a crowd on Monday that he doesn\u2019t \u201cknow what goes into paying hush money to a porn star\u201d and later implied in an interview that if he won the Oval Office, he would be far more disciplined than Trump was in his riotous four years as president. \u201cNo daily drama, focus on the big picture, and put points on the board,\u201d DeSantis told Piers Morgan on TalkTV, just as news of Trump\u2019s legal woes was reminding Americans of the daily drama he served up for four years. With Trump facing legal peril, DeSantis steps out and sharpens attacks \u201cThe governor can\u2019t afford to be marginalized from the get go,\u201d one DeSantis adviser told CNN\u2019s Steve Contorno amid Trump\u2019s attacks on the governor. \u201cHe clearly made the calculus it was time to push back.\u201d Trump lashing out at DeSantis, who has yet to declare a campaign, is cranking up the GOP presidential race to its most intense level yet just as the former president\u2019s legal problems also seem to be exploding. \u201cThe fact is, Ron is an average Governor, but the best by far in the Country in one category, Public Relations, where he easily ranks Number One,\u201d Trump said in a Wednesday statement savaging the record of the man he once considered a prot\u00e9g\u00e9. \u201cBut it is all a Mirage, just look at the facts and figures, they don\u2019t lie\u2014And we don\u2019t want Ron as our President!\u201d The former president\u2019s fury presented DeSantis, who won a double-digit reelection victory in Florida last fall, with the diciest moment yet in his pseudo campaign and could test Trump\u2019s still enormous hold over the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement. But Trump\u2019s legal mire also may remind voters who rejected him in 2020 and some of his favored candidates in last year\u2019s midterms why they were alienated by his chaotic leadership. DeSantis is not the only Republican seeking a political opening. Trump\u2019s Republican allies in the House have been demonstrating his enduring strength with the grassroots voters who sent them to Washington by unleashing an extraordinary assault on the Manhattan DA. As Trump once did, they are using the power of government to try to prevent him from being held to account and to defuse his legal threats. GOP House committee chairs have, for instance, demanded Bragg\u2019s testimony and have pledged to find out whether his probe used any federal funds. All of this underscores the fact that more than two years after Trump left office, the nation is nowhere near working through the enormous political and legal trauma of his term. And if the events of recent days are any indication, Americans may be in for another round of turmoil.",

            "article_content": "The extraordinary legal peril surrounding Donald Trump is reaching a fever pitch at the same time the former president is forging ahead in a 2024 Republican primary that is increasingly dominated by criminal investigations in New York, Washington and Atlanta. But there\u2019s no public information as to when or whether an indictment could be filed, leaving the former president and the public in suspense. The Manhattan grand jury that has been hearing evidence in the case pertaining to Trump\u2019s alleged role in a scheme to pay hush money to an adult film star will sit on Thursday, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. NBC first reported the development. New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg\u2019s office has suggested to an attorney for at least one witness in the past 24 hours that they might need to provide more testimony to the grand jury in its hush money probe, according to one source familiar with the probe. Notable legal clouds that continue to hang over Donald Trump in 2023 The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office is trying to determine whether to call back Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, to refute the testimony provided earlier this week by lawyer Robert Costello \u2013 or to call an additional witness to buttress their case before the grand jurors consider a vote on whether to indict the former president, the source familiar with the investigation said. Representatives for both the DA\u2019s office and Cohen declined to comment to CNN. There is still the possibility that the grand jury could be asked to vote this week, but it could also stretch into next week, the source said. Expectations are high that Bragg, a Democrat, is getting ready to make a decision on a potential indictment against Trump any day now over a hush-money payment scheme to adult film star Stormy Daniels. Bragg has said little about the status of the probe or whether Trump will even be charged. The Manhattan grand jury has typically heard testimony on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, but it did not meet on Wednesday. Earlier Wednesday, two sources told CNN that the grand jury was on standby, but it had not yet gotten a call to come in. Prosecutors do not have an urgent deadline as the grand jury sits until June. As the investigation nears its final stages, prosecutors are considering the historic nature of prosecuting a former president \u2013 an unprecedented act, sources tell CNN. Other sources tell CNN the DA\u2019s office is taking a moment to regroup after the events of the past week. In another blow to Trump\u2019s legal team, Trump\u2019s defense attorney Evan Corcoran is scheduled to testify Friday before the grand jury investigating classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago after a new order from a federal appeals court, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. The US DC Court of Appeals said that Corcoran must provide additional testimony and turn over documents about the former president as part of the criminal investigation into possible mishandling of classified documents from Trump\u2019s time in the White House. The source said Trump\u2019s side is unlikely to appeal to the Supreme Court. The announcement from a panel of three judges in the appeals court \u2013 less than a day after Trump sought to put Corcoran\u2019s testimony on hold \u2013 adds momentum to the special counsel investigation as it seeks to secure evidence that could make or break a federal criminal case against Trump. After Trump posted on social media this past weekend calling for protests on his behalf, city and federal officials have been increasing security and continuing to discuss how to handle potential demonstrations and the logistics of a former president being arrested. Sources have suggested that even if there was an indictment this week, court proceedings would not take place until the following week. The DA has not made any public comments about the state or pace of the investigation. But recent testimony from Costello, as well as an offer to allow Trump himself to testify, had signaled that Bragg was nearing a charging decision. Costello, who once represented Cohen, appeared in front of the grand jury on Monday at the request of Trump\u2019s legal team, which legal experts say likely marked the first time that the grand jury would have heard testimony on behalf of the former president. Exclusive: Communications between Stormy Daniels and Trump attorney turned over to Manhattan DA But in another potential setback for Trump, communications between Daniels and an attorney who is now representing Trump, Joe Tacopina, have been turned over to the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office, Daniels\u2019 lawyer told CNN. The exchanges \u2013 which are said to date back to 2018, when Daniels was seeking representation \u2013 raise the possibility Tacopina could be sidelined from Trump\u2019s defense in the case. At his home in Mar-a-Lago, Trump appears to have resigned himself to the likelihood he will be indicted by the Manhattan district attorney, as he\u2019s both celebrated how it would help him politically and complained about how \u201cunfair\u201d it is, according to sources close to the former president. Meanwhile, Trump is the focus of a separate investigation led by special counsel Jack Smith over the handling of classified documents. Wednesday\u2019s appeals court decision that Corcoran must testify before the grand jury investigating the matter followed a flurry of activity in response to a major ruling from a district court judge. That ruling indicated that the Justice Department argued successfully it had evidence Trump may have committed a crime, sources familiar with the matter told CNN. The three-judge panel of the appeals court gave the Justice Department and Trump\u2019s lawyers just hours to file briefs over DOJ\u2019s push to force Corcoran to testify, a rapid timeline that underscored the court\u2019s view it was a critical case that needed to be decided in haste. EXCLUSIVE: Dozens of Mar-a-Lago staff, from servers to aides, are subpoenaed in classified documents probe Corcoran previously testified and declined to answer some questions, citing attorney-client privilege. Prosecutors are also seeking access to notes from Corcoran. The documents at issue in the case are Corcoran\u2019s handwritten notes and transcribed verbal notes, regarding his representation of Trump in the Mar-a-Lago probe, according to a source familiar with the matter. It\u2019s not fully known what Corcoran\u2019s testimony and documents would reveal. While the special counsel case could pose a more serious legal threat to the president, it\u2019s the Manhattan district attorney who appears closest to bringing charges. Amid the uncertainty over how the yearslong investigation will wrap, several advisers to the former president expressed frustration at the lack of information around a potential indictment and the logistical complications that would come with an appearance in New York, where Trump would be arraigned. \u201cWe\u2019re planning for what we can: What does he say and when?\u201d another adviser told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot we can really plan for right now.\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys are also seeking to undercut an investigation into the former president in Georgia over efforts to overturn the 2020 election in the state. Trump\u2019s attorneys this week asked a judge to toss the final report and evidence from a special grand jury in Fulton County. The potential indictment of Trump in New York is not affecting the pace of charging decisions in the Fulton County case, where charges could come as soon as this spring in that case, CNN has previously reported. This story has been updated with additional developments. CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel, Sara Murray, Kaitlan Collins, Tierney Sneed and  Lauren del Valle contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The grand jury empaneled as part of the investigation into Donald Trump\u2019s alleged role in a scheme to pay hush money to adult film star Stormy Daniels on Monday heard from a potentially key witness put forward by the former president\u2019s legal team. Robert Costello, an attorney who has previously represented Trump allies like Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani, testified before the grand jury in New York for nearly three hours Monday afternoon after appearing at the request of the former president\u2019s legal team. Costello was expected to offer evidence that contradicts testimony provided by former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who has admitted to paying $130,000 to Daniels just before the 2016 election to stop her from going public about an alleged affair with the former president. Trump has denied the affair. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to Michael Cohen stand in front of the courthouse and say things that are directly contrary to what he said to us,\u201d Costello said Monday after his appearance before the grand jury. \u201cLet them see exactly who Michael Cohen is and was at that moment,\u201d Costello added, referring to the grand jury.  \u201cNow he\u2019s on the revenge tour. I understand it but I don\u2019t condone it. And that\u2019s why I went in there today to tell these people who the real Michael Cohen is and what he was actually saying at that moment in time.\u201d Costello\u2019s appearance is unusual for grand jury proceedings, particularly because he has previously served as Cohen\u2019s legal adviser. The Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office has signaled they are closing in on a decision of whether or not to indict the former president. Trump on Saturday said he expects to be arrested this week in connection with the yearslong case and called on his supporters to protest any such move, prompting security concerns in New York City. While an indictment could happen as soon as this week, it is more likely that any potential court appearance by Trump would not occur before next week, according to a senior law enforcement official familiar with the ongoing discussions about security. No final decision on an indictment has been made, and the law enforcement official stressed they had no knowledge of the district attorney\u2019s intentions. A source close to the Trump legal team told CNN that they do not expect any arrest or initial appearance to happen before next week should Trump be indicted, and they do not have any guidance on the timing of a potential indictment beyond that they have been told by the DA that nothing is expected Tuesday. Cohen made himself available as a rebuttal witness for the district attorney\u2019s office on Monday but \u201cwas not needed,\u201d according to a statement provided to CNN by his lawyer, Lanny Davis, after Cohen left the courthouse without testifying. \u201cMr. Cohen was available for over two hours today, but we are pleased to report Mr. Cohen was not needed. Once again we repeat \u2014 the facts and documents speak for themselves. Facts do matter,\u201d Davis said. Cohen previously told MSNBC that he has been asked to be at the district attorney\u2019s office Monday as a rebuttal witness, but said he wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d be answering questions before the grand jury or in an interview with the Manhattan DA. \u201cWhether it\u2019s before the grand jury or just with them for another interview, again, I\u2019m not sure,\u201d Cohen said. Costello contacted both the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office and lawyers for Trump to offer evidence that contradicts what Cohen has said publicly about the alleged hush money payments, a person familiar with the matter said. CNN has reached out to the DA\u2019s office. Costello spoke following his testimony, noting he told the grand jury that Cohen said at the time he had \u201cdecided on his own\u201d to take care of the payment to Daniels. Costello told CNN he has handed over hundreds of documents to the Manhattan district attorney, including more than 300 emails related to Cohen, and plans to offer evidence that contradicts what Cohen has said publicly about hush money payments he facilitated. What to know about NY prosecutors' probe into Trump's role in hush money scheme Costello also said he has turned over contemporaneous memos of his meeting with Cohen at the Regency hotel several years ago and his interview with the US attorney after Cohen waived attorney-client privilege. He claimed after his appearance Monday that the Manhattan district attorney had not yet provided all of those documents to the grand jury, accusing prosecutors of cherry-picking emails. In a letter to prosecutors obtained by CNN, Trump\u2019s legal team requested that Costello testify before the grand jury about what Cohen told him. Costello contends Cohen repeatedly told him he did not know of any criminal activity by Trump in any matter, according to the letter, which also says Cohen waived attorney-client privilege. \u201cGiven the central role Mr. Cohen\u2019s testimony plays in this grand jury investigation, we believe this testimony \u2013 that Mr. Cohen previously stated that he was unaware of any criminal activity by President Trump \u2013 is crucial to allow the grand jury to exercise its \u2018role \u2026 as a buffer between the accused and the government,\u2019\u201d Susan Necheles, who is representing Trump in the Manhattan case, wrote in the letter. Costello played a questionable role in the Daniels case when it was being handled by federal investigators. After federal investigators searched Cohen\u2019s home and office in 2018 but before he pleaded guilty to federal crimes, Costello told Cohen he was in touch with Rudy Giuliani \u2013 then Trump\u2019s lawyer in the Russia probe \u2013 and wrote, \u201cSleep well tonight, you have friends in high places,\u201d according to the report produced by former special counsel Robert Mueller. The then-special counsel found that Trump and his allies at the time may have been trying to persuade Cohen not to cooperate with investigators, who were looking into the Daniels payment and other business dealings. Investigative documents from the Mueller probe note Costello spoke to Cohen about pardons and was angry when Cohen hired a prominent New York defense attorney, according to Cohen. The Mueller investigation didn\u2019t describe Costello as Cohen\u2019s lawyer. Costello also tried to help Bannon as his lawyer during the January 6 congressional investigation and winded up being a witness in Bannon\u2019s contempt case from whom prosecutors gathered some communications records. Why a Trump indictment would have huge political and national implications An indictment against Trump would be historic, marking the first time a former US president or major presidential candidate has ever been criminally charged. And while Trump has an extensive history of civil litigation both before and after taking office, a criminal charge would represent a dramatic escalation of his legal woes as he works to recapture the White House. The former president has been agitating for his team to get his base riled up and believes that an indictment would help him politically, multiple people briefed on the matter told CNN, though in private, he has called the looming development \u201cunfair.\u201d Publicly, he has taken to social media to try and leverage the situation. In a post on Saturday, Trump said he expects to be arrested in connection with the investigation, though he did not expand on why he thought charges were imminent and his team said after his post that it had not received any notifications from prosecutors. In an echo of Trump\u2019s appeals to supporters in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, he called for action, writing: \u201cProtest, take our nation back.\u201d Trump shadow looms large over House GOP policy retreat In his most recent posts, Trump has refrained from calling for protests, as allies have told him such comments are not helpful, and instead focused on criticizing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. In an example of the difficult situation for Republicans, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who has attacked Bragg and said any possible indictment would be \u201can outrageous abuse of power,\u201d has also said he doesn\u2019t believe people should protest. \u201cAnd I think President Trump, if you talked to him, he doesn\u2019t believe that either,\u201d the California Republican told reporters Sunday night. But a lawyer for Trump, Alina Habba, predicted \u201cmayhem\u201d in New York if an indictment comes down. \u201cIf there are (security) concerns, that\u2019s rightfully so,\u201d Habba told CNN\u2019s Paula Reid Sunday evening. \u201cIf this is what we\u2019re doing in this country, you better secure the premises. \u2026 People are going to be upset.\u201d She also said that \u201cno one wants anyone to get hurt\u201d and Trump supporters should be \u201cpeaceful\u201d while exercising their First Amendment right to protest. Bragg wrote in an email to staff on Saturday that his office will \u201cnot tolerate attempts to intimidate our office or threaten the rule of law in New York.\u201d He said his office is coordinating with the New York City Police Department and the court to \u201censure that any specific or credible threats against the office will be fully investigated and that the proper safeguards are in place so all 1,600 of us have a secure work environment,\u201d according to the email, which was first obtained by Politico.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence balked at the idea of a potential indictment of Donald Trump, categorizing any possible prosecutorial actions as \u201cpolitically charged\u201d and \u201cnot what the American people want to see.\u201d Speaking with ABC\u2019s Jon Karl during a taped interview Saturday, Pence defended any peaceful protests that may break out at Trump\u2019s behest, after the former president called for his supporters to \u201ctake our nation back,\u201d while still condemning the egregious violence that the country witnessed at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe American people have a constitutional right to peacefully assemble,\u201d Pence said, adding, \u201cThe frustration the American people feel about what they sense is a two-tiered justice system in this country, I think is well founded. But I believe that people understand that if they give voice to this \u2013 if this occurs on Tuesday, that they need to do so peaceful and in a lawful manner.\u201d Pence\u2019s comments underscore his attempts to walk a fine line in issuing criticism and support for his former boss amid mounting expectations that he will vie for the Republican presidential nomination. Just last week, at the annual Gridiron Club dinner in Washington, DC, the former vice president issued his most blistering comments yet about Trump\u2019s role in the attack on the Capitol. \u201cPresident Trump was wrong. I had no right to overturn the election, and his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know that history will hold Donald Trump accountable,\u201d Pence said at the dinner. Trump has repeatedly pushed back on that assertion and argued Pence was at fault because he didn\u2019t attempt to overturn the 2020 election results. \u201cThe president\u2019s wrong,\u201d Pence told ABC. \u201cHe was wrong that day, and I had actually hoped that he would come around in time, Jon, that he would see that the cadre of legal advisers that he surrounded himself with had led him astray. But he hasn\u2019t done so and it\u2019s \u2026 I think it\u2019s one of the reasons why the country just wants a fresh start.\u201d Pence said the former president let him and the country down on January 6 and Trump\u2019s continued discourse on the events is one of the reasons why the former duo has gone their \u201cseparate ways.\u201d Still, Pence maintained he is \u201ctaken aback at the idea of indicting a former president of the United States.\u201d Trump said Saturday that he expects to be arrested in connection with the yearslong investigation into a hush money scheme involving adult film actress Stormy Daniels and he called on his supporters to protest any such move. In a social media post, Trump, referring to himself, said the \u201cleading Republican candidate and former president of the United States will be arrested on Tuesday of next week\u201d \u2013 though he did not say why he expects to be arrested. His team said after Trump\u2019s post that it had not received any notifications from prosecutors. Law enforcement has discussed how to navigate the potential indictment on a criminal charge by a New York county grand jury and the choreography around the possibility of an unprecedented arrest of a former president. Should he be indicted, Trump is expected to surrender and be processed and arraigned at a New York courthouse, which includes fingerprinting and mug shots, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. \u201cAt a time when there\u2019s a crime wave in New York City, the fact that the Manhattan DA thinks that indicting president Trump is his top priority just tells you everything you need to know about the radical left in this country,\u201d Pence said Saturday. Turning to the subpoena he received from the special counsel investigating Trump\u2019s post-2020 election activities, Pence said he is not challenging all the elements of the subpoena and that he and his lawyers aren\u2019t asserting executive privilege. Trump, though, has already cited executive privilege in a motion to prevent Pence from testifying before a grand jury. As for 2024, Pence said he is \u201cgiving serious consideration\u201d to a White House bid, and, speaking to reporters in Des Moines, Iowa, on Saturday, he said, \u201cNo one is above the law, and I\u2019m confident President Trump can take care of himself. My focus is going to continue to be on the issues that are affecting the American people.\u201d Lauren Koenig and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The seized cell phone of Rep. Scott Perry contained 930 records where the Pennsylvania Republican often tried to cajole executive branch officials around the 2020 presidential election, according to newly released court papers in the fight over his cell phone data. \u201cRep. Perry\u2019s communications with Executive Branch officials, as reflected in the responsive records, demonstrate that he welcomed, rather than resisted, and indeed often initiated these communication [redacted],\u201d Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court wrote in one of four unsealed opinions, after she had reviewed the records and decided to release them to prosecutors. Around the 2020 election, the Pennsylvania lawmaker had been in touch with President Donald Trump and powerful Trump backers, including White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark and others who pushed false claims of election fraud. His communications with the executive branch, she wrote, were \u201cproactive, persistent and protracted.\u201d The newly available court records provide more insight into the scope of the ongoing fight over Perry\u2019s phone, which is part of special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s criminal investigation around January 6, 2021. In total, Howell on Friday unsealed four opinions with redactions that she wrote related to the Justice Department\u2019s ability to access more than 2,200 records on the congressman\u2019s cell phone, after the FBI seized the device last year. Appeals court questions access that prosecutors can have to a GOP lawmaker's phone seized in 2020 election investigation Howell also called Perry\u2019s phone compendium a \u201cmulti-pronged push for Executive Branch officials to take more aggressive action,\u201d likely in response to suspicions of election fraud, and deemed those cell phone records not covered by congressional protection. In another part of her rulings, Howell wrote how Perry\u2019s communications with private individuals shouldn\u2019t stay secret from investigators, either \u2013 including almost 700 records showing his interest in election security and electors as well as contact with Trump campaign attorneys. \u201cWhat is plain is that the Clause does not shield Rep. Perry\u2019s random musings with private individuals touting an expertise in cybersecurity or political discussions with attorneys from a presidential campaign, or with state legislators concerning hearings before them about possible local election fraud or actions they could take to challenge election results in Pennsylvania,\u201d Howell wrote. While Howell ultimately let Perry keep about 161 of his records from investigators under the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause \u2013 a provision that shields legislators from certain law enforcement actions targeting conduct related to their legislative duties \u2013 she ordered that the 2,000 other records be given to Justice Department investigators. The inquiry is now part of special counsel Smith\u2019s January 6 investigation. Perry has appealed her ruling, managing to keep secret all 2,000 records for almost seven months since his phone\u2019s seizure, and the DC Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in the case on Thursday. Because some of those arguments were public, Howell released redacted versions of her opinions and orders in the case Friday night. She largely rejected Perry\u2019s arguments for privacy, calling his approach to the case an \u201castonishing view of the scope of the legislative privilege\u201d that would \u201ctruly cloak Members of Congress with a powerful dual non-disclosure and immunity shield for virtually any of their activities that could be deemed information gathering about any matter which might engage legislative attention.\u201d The unsealed court orders also provided  more insight into the search itself, and how the case came to be. After Perry\u2019s phone was seized and copied by FBI agents on August 9, the Justice Department returned to court for a warrant to review the contents of his phone. Nine days later, Howell approved the warrant, \u201cfinding probable cause that a crime was committed\u201d and that evidence of the crime would be found on Perry\u2019s phone, according to the unsealed opinions. Perry had 44 days to argue to the court his Speech or Debate privileges as a member of Congress, which could protect records of legitimate legislative activity from the federal investigation. He told the court his phone contained \u201ccommunications with his staff, members of Congress, and others\u201d \u2013 then logged records on his phone, including \u201cNotes,\u201d by date, recipient, sender and subject matter for a judge to consider. Howell then went through those records. Perry has not been charged with a crime. Howell last November showed concern that Perry\u2019s team was trying to \u201cunilaterally delay\u201d the criminal investigation. The court fight itself has put on hold DOJ\u2019s ability to access the content of Perry\u2019s phone. And, Howell accused Perry\u2019s team of slow-walking the work on the case, as their review of the contents of the phone last fall went slowly as the litigation moved forward. His team was reviewing his phone records for possible privilege assertions at a rate of 265 documents a day, the Justice Department told the judge, while the court had ordered them to review records at a rate of 800 a day, according to one of the opinions released Friday. \u201cIf Rep. Perry has indeed significantly deviated from the pace required under the Perry Privilege Log Order, and he continues to slow-walk producing privilege logs to the government \u2026 he risks forfeiting his right to assert his privilege,\u201d she wrote in November. \u201cRep. Perry is now on notice to speed up his review.\u201d The timing of his documents review didn\u2019t arise again in Howell\u2019s future opinions, according to the redacted now-released court records.

            "article_content": "A federal appeals court on Thursday questioned the access that Justice Department prosecutors can have to a GOP lawmaker\u2019s phone seized as part of the special counsel investigation into 2020 election subversion. At a partially public hearing Thursday, the US DC Circuit Court of Appeals grappled with the scope of a constitutional provision that shields legislators from certain law enforcement actions and had tough questions for both the attorney representing Republican Rep. Scott Perry, whose phone was seized by the FBI in August, and for the Justice Department attorney arguing in favor of prosecutors being able to obtain communications from the device. Many details of the dispute remain shrouded in secrecy, including an underlying district court opinion that Perry appealed to the circuit court. An attorney for Perry said Thursday that the files in question pertained to the discussions the Pennsylvania congressman was having about two legislative matters: a election rules reform bill Congress was considering in early 2021 and Perry\u2019s vote on the January 6, 2021, certification of the presidential election results. A lawyer for the special counsel\u2019s office did not provide that level of detail about what\u2019s at issue in the case, argued that the Justice Department should be able to access a member of Congress\u2019 cell phone records if they were making calls as informal research before a possible legislative vote. The key issue in the case is whether the Constitution\u2019s so-called Speech or Debate Clause \u2013 which says legislators cannot be questioned on \u201cany Speech or Debate\u201d in Congress \u2013 applies to a lawmaker\u2019s \u201cinformal fact finding\u201d that was not formally authorized by Congress. Two judges on the circuit panel \u2013 Circuit Judges Gregory Katsas and Neomi Rao, both Trump appointees \u2013 zeroed in on this issue in their questions for DOJ attorney John Pellettieri. They seemed to balk at the hard line he drew that those kinds of informal communications were not protected by the clause. The judges, however, also grilled Rowley on whether he was pushing a virtually limitless interpretation of the Clause that would shield all sort of communications lawmakers had, including with individuals not in Congress. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we put weight on the fact that what we\u2019re talking about here seems far afield from Speech or Debate?\u201d Katsas asked Rowley. How the DC Circuit views the 17-word constitutional provision could have implications not just for how the Trump investigations proceed, but what sort of immunity legislators have in all sorts of court proceedings going forward \u2013 particularly if the conduct is not clearly part of their formal activities in Congress. \u201cWe want members of Congress to be able to do their jobs without constantly being hauled into court,\u201d said Elliot Williams, a former Justice Department official who also worked for the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cBut it defies logic and probably the Constitution for Congress to think it can wave a wand and call everything it touches quote \u2018informal legislative fact-finding.\u2019\u201d Perry was identified by the House January 6 committee as a player in Trump\u2019s efforts to weaponize the Justice Department. Perry did not comply with a subpoena from the committee for his testimony. After the FBI seized Perry\u2019s phone access, he filed a public lawsuit challenging investigators\u2019 access to its contents. However, the wrangling between him and the Justice Department has played out in private court proceedings. Only the first hour or so of the roughly 90 minute hearing played out in open court, with the latter part of the proceedings taking place under seal. The Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause says that \u201cfor any Speech or Debate in either House,\u201d lawmakers \u201cshall not be questioned in any other Place.\u201d It functions as a separation-of-powers provision that prevents legislators from being arrested or being forced to participate in court proceedings for their legislative conduct on the congressional floor. Courts have also said the clause extends to lawmaker conduct in congressional committee proceedings and that it also can cover congressional staff. The Speech of Debate Clause is \u201cnot a get out of jail free card,\u201d Thomas Spulak, who served as general counsel to the House of Representatives in the 1990s, told CNN this week. \u201cIt only protects them from questioning, being subpoenaed or anything else for any legislative acts,\u201d Spulak said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing today is a judicial analysis of what defines a legislative act.\u201d In the judges\u2019 questions for the DOJ Thursday, the DC Circuit panel appeared sympathetic to Perry\u2019s position that informal discussions that legislators have with outside parties can amount to the type of legislative activity covered by the clause. \u201cSuppose a member is deliberating how to vote. They do a series of calls to key stakeholders and records the calls. You think you can get that?\u201d Katsas asked Pellettieri. Rao asked the DOJ lawyer: \u201cWhy is an individual\u2019s fact finding not a precursor to legislative proceeding?\u201d Already, the Speech or Debate clause has been invoked in disputes arising from investigations into 2020 election subversion, including when South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham tried to resist a testimonial subpoena issued in the Fulton County grand jury probe. Rowley, at Thursday\u2019s hearing, pointed to the Graham case and other decisions as supporting Perry\u2019s arguments. He offered the recent trail derailment in Ohio as an example of the type of matter a lawmaker would do his own research on for potential legislation even though Congress had not yet set up a formal investigation. Still, the judges hinted their wariness of interpreting the provision too broadly \u201cI am wondering what you think might be the limits of such a non-disclosure privilege,\u201d Rao asked Rowley. In seeking to block DOJ\u2019s access to Perry\u2019s phone, his lawyers have pointed specifically to a 2007 ruling concerning an FBI search of then-Rep. William Jefferson\u2019s congressional office in a bribery probe. The DC Circuit said that the Justice Department ran afoul of the constitutional clause by sorting through the Louisiana Democrat\u2019s files without his consent. Chief Judge Beryl Howell, however, ruled under seal that in Perry\u2019s case, some of the communications on Perry\u2019s phones wouldn\u2019t fall under his legislative work because they weren\u2019t sanctioned by any legislative authority. She said that investigators could access certain materials on Perry\u2019s phone that his lawyers had argued should be withheld. Howell\u2019s ruling did, however, allow Perry to protect some of his phone contents under the Speech or Debate Clause, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN. To make her decision, Howell confidentially reviewed details about the information that was on Perry\u2019s phone that the Justice Department sought, the source said. Prosecutors still haven\u2019t gotten access to the more than 2,000 records they seek. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals above Howell has put on hold her rulings, including investigators\u2019 ability to access Perry\u2019s phone records, as it hears arguments in the case on a much-quicker-than-usual timeline. On Thursday, Perry\u2019s attorney said that his circumstances were parallel to the 2007 case, with the difference being this search is of a cell phone instead of an office. The judges, however, asked Rowley whether the immunity applies once a lawmaker speaks to parties outside of Congress \u2013 and questioned whether that could theoretically cover all kinds of communications of a member of Congress using a cell phone. \u201cIt\u2019s not the cell phone that makes this odd, it\u2019s that the communication can be to anyone in the universe,\u201d  Katsas told Rowley. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, the third member of the panel, participated in Thursday\u2019s hearing remotely. Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, was on the circuit panel in the William Jefferson case and wrote a concurrence that took a much narrower view of the Speech or Debate Clause than the one embraced by the other judges on that decision. The DC Circuit is also considering whether it has the authority to intervene at this point, but the judges asked the parties to focus on the other legal questions in the case when arguing on Thursday. The House \u2013 with the approval of both majority and minority leadership \u2013 has sought to weigh in on the case, in a sign of how the Perry litigation could set the rules for how the immunity applies to all sorts of lawmaker activity going forward. The House\u2019s filings, however, are not public. Spulak noted that, practically speaking, the role of a congressperson has become \u201cpretty broad\u201d over time and that their legislative duties can go beyond talking about a specific piece of legislation, \u201csince oversight is fundamental to the legislative process.\u201d In the Graham case, the US Supreme Court refused to block the Fulton County grand jury\u2019s subpoena for his testimony. The justices stressed that the lower courts that ordered his appearance had said that the Speech or Debate Clause precluded him from question about the \u201cinformal investigative fact finding\u201d that was part of his legislative activity. The DC Circuit\u2019s consideration of the Perry case could flesh out what kind of informal fact-finding amounts to protected legislative activity. \u201cDepending on how broad you read what a legislative act is, it could permit members of Congress to really cover lots of their conduct within the speech or Debate Clause that I think we would generally not think would be covered,\u201d said Neil Eggleston, a former White House counsel under President Barack Obama.

            "article_content": "The top investigator on the House committee that probed the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack said Wednesday it is \u201clikely\u201d that the Georgia and federal investigations into efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election will produce indictments. Timothy Heaphy told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d that \u201cunless there is information inconsistent, which I don\u2019t expect, I think there will likely be indictments both in Georgia and at the federal level.\u201d In Georgia, the foreperson of the Atlanta-based grand jury that investigated former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election told CNN on Tuesday that the panel is recommending multiple indictments and suggested \u201cthe big name\u201d may be on the list. The grand jury met for about seven months in Atlanta and heard testimony from 75 witnesses, including some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers from his final weeks in the White House. Now that the grand jury is finished, it\u2019s up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to review the recommendations and make charging decisions. Willis\u2019 decisions in this case will reverberate in the 2024 presidential campaign and beyond. Trump, who has launched his 2024 campaign for the White House, denies any criminal wrongdoing. At the federal level, special counsel Jack Smith is overseeing parts of the criminal investigation into the Capitol attack and has subpoenaed members of Trump\u2019s inner circle. On Wednesday, the New York Times reported that Smith had subpoenaed the former president\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner for testimony. \u201cI think it could be very important,\u201d Heaphy said of the pair\u2019s potential testimony. \u201cThey were present for really significant events. The special counsel will want to hear about the president\u2019s understanding of the election results and also what happened on January 6. And they both had direct communications with him about the events preceding the riot at the Capitol,\u201d he said. The special counsel has a massive amount of evidence already in-hand that it now needs to comb through, including evidence recently turned over by the House January 6 committee, subpoena documents provided by local officials in key states and discovery collected from lawyers for Trump allies late last year in a flurry of activity, at least some of which had not been reviewed as of early January, sources familiar with the investigation told CNN at the time. \u201cHe will not stop because of a family relationship, because of purported executive privilege,\u201d Heaphy said of Smith. \u201cHe believes that the law entitles him to all of that information, and he\u2019s determined to get it.\u201d Ivanka Trump and Kushner previously testified to the House select committee, which expired in January after Republicans took control of the House. The panel had referred the former president to the Justice Department on four criminal charges in December, and while largely symbolic in nature, committee members stressed those referrals served as a way to document their views given that Congress cannot bring charges.

            "article_content": "The foreperson of the Atlanta-based grand jury that investigated former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election told CNN on Tuesday that the panel is recommending multiple indictments and suggested \u201cthe big name\u201d may be on the list. \u201cCan you imagine doing this for eight months and not coming out with a whole list\u201d of recommended indictments, Emily Kohrs told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not a short list. It\u2019s not.\u201d She continued, \u201cThere may be some names on that list that you wouldn\u2019t expect. But the big name that everyone keeps asking me about \u2013 I don\u2019t think you will be shocked.\u201d Kohrs declined later Tuesday to disclose exactly how many indictments the special grand jury recommended be brought as part of the investigation, saying only that she believes it is more than 12. Asked by CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d whether the number of people was \u201cmore than a dozen,\u201d Kohrs replied: \u201cI believe so. That\u2019s probably a good assumption.\u201d Takeaways from the partial release of a Georgia grand jury report on Trump and 2020 election Portions of the grand jury\u2019s final report, released last week, made it clear that the grand jury believed perjury charges were warranted for some witnesses. The foreperson\u2019s identity was first revealed by The Associated Press. And earlier on Tuesday, Kohrs told The New York Times that the grand jury recommended multiple indictments, though she didn\u2019t provide names. The grand jury met for about seven months in Atlanta and heard testimony from 75 witnesses, including some of Trump\u2019s closest advisers from his final weeks in the White House. Now that the grand jury is finished, it\u2019s up to Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to review the recommendations and make charging decisions. Willis\u2019 decisions in this case will reverberate in the 2024 presidential campaign and beyond. Trump, who has launched his 2024 campaign for the White House, denies any criminal wrongdoing. He has claimed that Willis, a Democrat, is politically biased, and still regularly promotes the false claim that he actually won the election in Georgia. Jurors, Kohrs told Bolduan, \u201cdefinitely heard a lot about former President Trump and we definitely discussed him a lot in the room.\u201d Kohrs said that as part of the probe, she heard Trump on calls separate from the infamous post-election one he made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, asking him to \u201cfind\u201d the votes necessary to win Georgia. \u201cYes, I am positive I have heard the president on the phone more than once,\u201d she said. CNN previously reported that at least one additional call by Trump to a Georgia state official was part of the investigation. Willis\u2019 office was not responsible for authorizing whether or not members of the special grand jury could speak to the media and did not know ahead of time that Kohrs was going to go public, according to a source familiar with the situation. Despite Trump\u2019s claims that the prosecutors are liberal zealots on a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d Kohrs said she believed Willis and her team acted in a non-partisan fashion and tried to keep the proceedings fair. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there was bias on the part of the DA\u2019s team,\u201d she told CNN in the phone interview. \u201cI know for a fact that they were always very worried about accidentally coloring our opinions one way or the other \u2026 They told us that they didn\u2019t want any of their opinions to affect any of our opinions, or any of their additional knowledge to affect our knowledge.\u201d She said the prosecutors told her that they wanted the grand jury to \u201cmake your opinions\u201d independently and to \u201clook straight at this by yourselves.\u201d Interactive timeline: Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia Kohrs called on Willis to take \u201cdecisive action,\u201d now that the fate of the investigation is in her hands. \u201cPersonally, I hope to see her take almost any kind of decisive action, to actually do something,\u201d Kohrs said. \u201cThere are too many times in recent history that seem to me like someone has gotten called out for something that people had a problem with, and nothing ever happens.\u201d Kohrs said there are too many examples of \u201cfamous people\u201d avoiding accountability after high-profile investigations. \u201cHow often does something actually happen? I would love to see something actually happen. Don\u2019t make me take back my faith in the system,\u201d Kohrs said. \u201cThe only thing I would be disappointed in, at this point, is if this whole thing just disappears. That\u2019s the only thing that would make me sad.\u201d The foreperson also told CNN that she was \u201cpleasantly surprised\u201d by the friendliness of some witnesses, including key Trump insiders like former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn, even though he invoked privilege and declined to answer some questions. \u201cSome of those people fought not to be there, but once they were there, they were willing to have a conversation, and I respect the hell out of that,\u201d Kohrs said. \u201cFlynn was honestly very nice in person. He was a very nice man. He was definitely interesting. But I don\u2019t recall him saying anything earth-shattering.\u201d Using the Fifth Amendment or citing various legal privileges was a strategy that the grand jury saw from several of the most prominent witnesses, including Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, according to Kohrs. \u201cMark Meadows did not share very much,\u201d she said. \u201cI asked if he had Twitter, and he pled the Fifth.\u201d CNN has reached out to Meadows\u2019 attorney for comment about claims from Kohrs that he repeatedly invoked the Fifth and executive privilege. Separately, a source familiar with the matter confirmed Mike Pence\u2019s former chief of staff Marc Short appeared before the special grand jury under subpoena. His appearance was previously reported by The Associated Press. The Georgia investigation has long been seen as one of Trump\u2019s biggest unsettled legal vulnerabilities, though any prosecution of him would be ripe for constitutional challenges and would face more scrutiny than perhaps any previous case initiated by a local prosecutor. In addition, Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith is investigating Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election, his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection, and his possible mishandling of classified material. In New York, a criminal probe led by the Manhattan district attorney is still underway, and Trump\u2019s namesake business is fighting a civil fraud lawsuit from the state attorney general. This story has been updated with additional details Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Jason Morris, Francesca Hoffman and Sara Murray contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Special counsel Jack Smith is locked in at least eight secret court battles that aim to unearth some of the most closely held details about Donald Trump\u2019s actions after the 2020 election and handling of classified material, according to sources and court records reviewed by CNN. The outcome of these disputes could have far-reaching implications, as they revolve around a 2024 presidential candidate and could lead courts to shape the law around the presidency, separation of powers and attorney-client confidentiality in ways they\u2019ve never done before. Yet almost all of the proceedings are sealed, and filings and decisions aren\u2019t public. The sheer number of grand jury challenges from potential witnesses is both a reflection of the scope of the special counsel\u2019s investigation and a hallmark of Trump\u2019s ultra-combative style in the face of investigations. Pence says he's willing to take fight against DOJ subpoena in Trump probe to Supreme Court By comparison, Robert Mueller\u2019s grand jury investigation into Trump had a smattering of sealed proceedings where investigators used the court to pry for more answers, and independent counsel Kenneth Starr\u2019s Whitewater investigation ultimately totaled seven similar sealed cases. A key sealed case revealed Wednesday is an attempt to force more answers about direct conversations between Trump and his defense attorney Evan Corcoran, where the Justice Department is arguing the investigation found evidence the conversations may be part of furthering or covering up a crime related to the Mar-a-Lago document boxes. A spokesman for Smith\u2019s office declined to comment. About half a dozen cases are still ongoing in court, either before Chief Judge Beryl Howell or in the appeals court above her, the DC Circuit. Most appear to follow the typical arc of miscellaneous cases that arise during grand jury investigations, where prosecutors sometimes use the court to enforce their subpoenas. More challenges from subpoenaed witnesses \u2013 including former Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 are expected to be filed in the coming days, likely under seal as well. Pence may raise novel questions about the protections around the vice presidency. Investigations that implicate government officials often beget sealed court proceedings, because confidential grand jury witnesses become more likely to assert privileges that prompt prosecutors to ask judges to compel more answers, criminal law experts say. \u201cI think we are in extraordinary times. Part of it is I think President Trump continues to assert these theories long after they\u2019ve been batted away by the court,\u201d Neil Eggleston, a former White House counsel who argued for executive privilege during the Clinton administration and the Whitewater investigation. In Whitewater, after the court in DC ruled that privilege claims wouldn\u2019t hold up when a federal grand jury needed information, other witnesses shied away from trying to refuse to testify, Eggleston recalled. But in the Trump investigations, witnesses aligned continue to test whether he still may have special confidentiality protections. Still, the number of cases is out of the ordinary. The other known cases are: The Justice Department\u2019s long-running effort to enforce a May 2022 subpoena for all classified records in Trump\u2019s possession. After a sealed December hearing, Howell gave Smith\u2019s investigators an avenue to ask more questions of two people hired to search Trump\u2019s properties in December and found more documents with classified markings. Those two people testified to the grand jury late last month. Sixteen national media outlets, including CNN, have asked Howell to make public transcripts of hearings and other records in the case. An appeal over whether former Pence chief counsel Greg Jacob and chief of staff Marc Short should have been forced to answer questions about Trump interactions around January 6. Both went to the grand jury in DC on the same Friday last July and refused to give some answers because of Trump\u2019s attempted claims of confidentiality around the presidency. Court orders prompted them to testify a second time, seeking out more testimony from them in October last year, CNN previously confirmed. They both appeared a second time at the grand jury. The Trump team still has filed an appeal of Howell\u2019s decisions. An appeal over whether former Trump White House counsel Pat Cipollone and deputy White House counsel Patrick Philbin could decline to answer questions about direct conversations with Trump from the end of his presidency. Both men cited various privileges when they testified to the grand jury in September, but were forced to appear a second time and give more answers after court rulings in November and December, CNN previously confirmed. Though they have already testified twice, Trump\u2019s team filed an appeal. Trump lawyer says searches for classified material at Trump properties are complete Following the seizure of Pennsylvania GOP Rep. Scott Perry\u2019s cell phone in August in the January 6 investigation, lawyers for the congressman challenged the Justice Department\u2019s ability to access data taken from the phone, citing protection around Congress under the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause. Howell refused to keep the records from investigators, but an appeals court panel has blocked the DOJ from seeing the records so far, according to indications in the court record. The case is set for oral arguments on February 23 at the appeals court in Washington. The circuit court also has a request from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to unseal documents in the case. Both Republican and Democratic leadership in the US House have wanted a part in the case because of the implications for Congress, CNN has confirmed. Howell has released redacted versions of two attorney confidentiality decisions she made last year giving prosecutors access to emails between Perry and three lawyers \u2013 John Eastman, Jeffrey Clark and Ken Klukowski \u2013 before January 6, 2021. Howell separately denied Clark\u2019s attempt to keep from investigators a draft of his autobiography that discussed his efforts at the Justice Department on behalf of Trump before January 6. Clark had tried to mark the draft outline about his life as an attorney work product. The Justice Department secured a court order for Trump adviser Kash Patel to answer questions under oath in the Mar-a-Lago investigation. Patel initially declined to answer questions before the grand jury in October, citing his Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination. Then prosecutors fought for more answers by immunizing his testimony from prosecution, CNN previously reported. The suite of special counsel\u2019s office grand jury cases raises questions how transparent the courts will be regarding these cases, and how soon documents filed in court could become available. The New York Times and Politico are trying to convince Howell to release redacted versions of any sealed court fights related to the grand jury where Trump or others in his administration have tried to limit the investigation with claims of executive privilege, according to court filings. The media organizations argue there\u2019s a \u201cprofound national interest\u201d in those legal papers. But the Justice Department is against making disclosures related to the grand jury investigations \u2013 and won\u2019t even admit the proceedings are taking place. Third Trump attorney appears before federal grand jury investigating Mar-a-Lago documents On Monday, they argued to Howell that with the intense public interest around the cases, there should be even more secrecy than when the court releases other records. \u201cTo advance the policy goals underlying grand jury secrecy, it may well be necessary for a court to more frequently decline to release judicial opinions ancillary to grand jury investigations that are the subject of intense press attention as opposed to matters that have attracted little public attention,\u201d lawyers from the DOJ\u2019s civil division wrote. Howell is still deciding what to do.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that he is willing to take his fight against a subpoena for his testimony in the Justice Department\u2019s 2020 election subversion investigation all the way to the Supreme Court. \u201cI am going to fight the Biden DOJ subpoena for me to appear before the grand jury because I believe it\u2019s unconstitutional and unprecedented,\u201d Pence told reporters after making a speech in Iowa. He said he expects former President Donald Trump to bring his own challenge to the subpoena that will raise executive privilege claims. Pence, however, intends to fight the subpoena under the Constitution\u2019s Speech or Debate Clause, which shields legislators from certain law enforcement actions targeting conduct related to their legislative duties. While other witnesses have raised Speech or Debate Clause argument in efforts to resist subpoenas in the DOJ probe and in the other investigations into January 6, 2021, Pence plans to invoke the clause in relation to his role as president of the Senate \u2013 which is believed to be untrod legal ground. In that role, he presided over Congress\u2019 certification of the 2020 election results on January 6, 2021. \u201cOn the day of January 6, I was acting as President of the Senate, presiding over a Joint Session, described in the Constitution itself,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd so, I believe that that Speech and Debate Clause of the Constitution actually prohibits the executive branch from compelling me to appear in a court, as the Constitution says, or in any other place. And we\u2019ll stand on that principle and we\u2019ll take that case as far as it needs to go, if need be to the Supreme Court of the United States, because to me, it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s an issue of the separation of powers.\u201d He said that over the last \u201cseveral months,\u201d his team had made it clear to the Justice Department that he believed the Speech or Debate Clause precluded a subpoena for his testimony. CNN previously reported on Pence\u2019s plans to raise claims under the Speech or Debate Clause. Pence also noted that he has written and spoken publicly about the events leading up to the January 6 certification vote. But, he said, \u201cif we were to accede to accept a subpoena for appearance before a grand jury or a trial, I believe that would diminish the privileges enjoyed by any future vice president, either Democrat or Republican. I simply will not do that.\u201d Pence first spoke publicly about his plans to fight the subpoena at an event in Minneapolis earlier Wednesday, saying that his fight was about \u201d separation of powers\u201d and \u201cdefending the prerogatives that I had as president of the Senate.\u201d \u201cMy fight is on the separation of powers. My fight against the DOJ subpoena very simply is on defending the prerogatives that I had as president of the Senate to preside over the Joint Session of Congress on January 6,\u201d Pence told reporters in Minneapolis. \u201cFor me this is a moment where you have to decide where you stand and I stand on the Constitution of the United States,\u201d he added. Third Trump attorney appears before federal grand jury investigating Mar-a-Lago documents Pence is one of several former members of Trump\u2019s inner circle whose testimony federal investigators have sought, as they scrutinize the events leading up to and during the January 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol. That probe, as well as the federal investigation into Trump\u2019s handling of documents from his White House that were found at Mar-a-Lago, have taken a more aggressive tack since special counsel Jack Smith took over both investigations.

Special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s office is seeking documents and testimony related to January 6, and Meadows received the subpoena sometime in January, the source said. An attorney for Meadows declined to comment. The Justice Department did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the subpoena. The move to subpoena one of Trump\u2019s most senior aides \u2013 in addition to the recent subpoena of former Vice President Mike Pence, as CNN reported last week \u2013 marks the latest significant step in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s role in seeking to overturn the outcome of the 2020 election. Smith also is simultaneously investigating Trump\u2019s handling of classified documents after leaving office. While the subpoena is related to January 6, Meadows also may be of interest in the documents investigation. He was one of Trump\u2019s designees to the National Archives and played a role in discussions around returning government records in his possession. The special counsel\u2019s subpoena could set up a clash with the Justice Department and Meadows over executive privilege. The former White House chief of staff, citing executive privilege, previously fought a subpoena from a special grand jury in Georgia that was investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election results. A judge later ordered Meadows to testify, finding him \u201cmaterial and necessary to the investigation.\u201d Meadows was involved in the infamous phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and in a December 2020 White House meeting about election fraud claims. Meadows also visited a site where an audit of Georgia\u2019s election was underway and sent emails to Justice Department officials about unsubstantiated fraud allegations. On January 6, Meadows was in and out of the Oval Office and witness to Trump\u2019s actions as rioters overtook the US Capitol that day. The recent subpoena for Meadows also underscores the aggressive nature of the special counsel\u2019s probe. CNN has reported that Smith also has subpoenaed former Trump national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien in both of the Trump-related probes, and Justice Department lawyers interviewed Trump\u2019s former acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf in recent weeks as part of the probe into 2020 election interference.

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Mike Pence has been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating Donald Trump and his role in January 6, 2021, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Special counsel Jack Smith\u2019s office is seeking documents and testimony related to January 6, the source said. They want the former vice president to testify about his interactions with Trump leading up to the 2020 election and the day of the attack on the US Capitol. The subpoena marks an important milestone in the Justice Department\u2019s two-year criminal investigation, now led by the special counsel, into the efforts by Trump and allies to impede the transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. Pence is an important witness who has detailed in a memoir some of his interactions with Trump in the weeks after the election, a move that likely opens the door for the Justice Department to override at least some of Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege. Pence\u2019s attorney Emmet Flood is known as a hawk on executive privilege, and people familiar with the discussions have said Pence was expected to claim at least some limits on providing details of his direct conversations with Trump. Depending on his responses, prosecutors have the option to ask a judge to compel him to answer additional questions and override Trump\u2019s executive privilege claims. First on CNN: Trump's former national security adviser subpoenaed in special counsel probes of classified documents, January 6 ABC News first reported on the subpoena. Pence\u2019s office declined to confirm he had been subpoenaed. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment to CNN on the matter. Months of negotiations preceded the subpoena to the former vice president, CNN has reported. Justice Department prosecutors had reached out to Pence\u2019s representatives to seek his testimony in the criminal investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. Pence\u2019s team had indicated he was open to discussing a possible agreement with DOJ to provide some testimony, one person said. That request occurred before the department appointed Smith to oversee two Trump-related investigations, the January 6-related probe and another into alleged mishandling of classified materials found at the former president\u2019s Mar-a-Lago residence. In November, Pence published his memoir that detailed some of his interactions with Trump as the former president sought to overturn the results of his election loss to President Joe Biden. Pence and his team knew that the book\u2019s publication would raise the prospect that the Justice Department would likely seek information about those interactions as part of its criminal investigation, people briefed on the matter told CNN. Pence rebuffed an interview request from the House select committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection, but allowed top aides to provide testimony in the House\u2019s probe, as well as in the Justice Department\u2019s criminal investigation. The DOJ successfully secured answers from top Pence advisers Greg Jacob and Marc Short in significant court victories that could make it more likely the criminal investigation reaches further into Trump\u2019s inner circle. There are no plans for Trump\u2019s team to challenge the grand jury subpoena of Pence at this time, according to a source familiar with its thinking. But it would still be possible for Trump to attempt to assert executive privilege over some conversations they had, if Pence declines to detail those conversations to the grand jury. So far, Trump\u2019s team has lost those challenges when Pence\u2019s deputies and two White House counsel\u2019s office attorneys testified, following Chief Judge Beryl Howell\u2019s rulings that they must answer questions they initially refused to because of confidentiality around the presidency. Howell\u2019s tenure as chief judge of the DC District Court ends in mid-March, meaning a different federal judge, James Boasberg, could be the one to field privilege disputes in the continuing grand jury investigation. CNN reported earlier Thursday that Smith had also subpoenaed former Trump national security adviser Robert O\u2019Brien in both of the Trump-related probes, according to a source familiar with the matter. O\u2019Brien has been asserting executive privilege in declining to provide some of the information that prosecutors are seeking from him, the source said. Trump\u2019s former acting Department of Homeland Security secretary was separately interviewed by Justice Department lawyers in recent weeks as part of the probe into 2020 election interference, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Rather than appearing before a federal grand jury, former acting secretary Chad Wolf was interviewed under oath by Justice Department lawyers and FBI officials, something one of the sources characterized as a \u201cstandard\u201d first step for prosecutors.

            "article_content": "The House January 6 committee on Sunday released another wave of witness interview transcripts. The new release is part of a steady stream of transcript drops from the House select committee in recent days, complementing the release of its sweeping 845-page report. The latest transcript drop comes as the panel winds down its work with the House majority set to change hands from Democrats to Republicans on Tuesday at the start of the new Congress. The transcripts released so far have shed new light on how the House committee conducted its investigation of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol \u2013 and new details about what key witnesses told the panel. Here are some of the highlights from the latest disclosures: Mark Meadows, former President Donald Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff, provided the select committee with 6,600 pages of email records and approximately 2,000 text messages, according to a transcript of a deposition for which Meadows did not appear in December 2021. Investigators ran through some of the items they had hoped to ask Meadows about if he had appeared, including a December 2020 email from Meadows stating, \u201cRudy was put in charge. That was the President\u2019s decision,\u201d according to the committee transcript. The committee also hoped to ask Meadows about certain passages in his book, specific text message exchanges and his outreach to the Justice Department \u201cencouraging investigations of suspected voter fraud.\u201d The committee also planned to ask Meadows about his communications regarding deploying the National Guard on January 6, \u201cincluding a January 5th email from Mr. Meadows in which he indicates that the Guard would be present at the Capitol to, quote, \u2018protect pro-Trump people,\u2019 end quote.\u201d The committee similarly convened no-show deposition meetings for former Trump aide Dan Scavino, former Trump administration official Peter Navarro and right-wing media personality Steve Bannon, who previously worked in the Trump White House. The brief transcripts of those meetings document the failure of the witnesses to appear and communications the committee had with the witnesses or their representatives. In a transcript with Alexandra Preate, who worked as a spokeswoman for Bannon, the committee asked about their text exchanges. In one, the two appeared to be discussing \u2013 days after the Capitol was attacked \u2013 1 million people surrounding the Capitol after Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration on January 20, 2021. The committee interviewer quotes Bannon\u2019s text as saying, \u201cI\u2019d surround the Capitol in total silence.\u201d When asked if she and Bannon talked about bringing people back to Washington, DC, even after January 6, Preate said, \u201cI don\u2019t recall that\u201d and it was \u201cnot my deal.\u201d Preate also said she believes Trump lost the election.

Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel told the committee that the former president called her on January 1, 2021, and asked her about her relationship with then-Vice President Mike Pence. \u201cI do have a recollection of him asking me what my relationship was with the Vice President, and I said I didn\u2019t know him very well,\u201d McDaniel told the select committee, according to a transcript. McDaniel said she could not recall if they specifically discussed the role Pence would play in certifying the Electoral College vote five days after that call. But McDaniel said that later on, after the US Capitol attack, Trump conveyed to her privately \u201cin one way or another that, you know, the Vice President had the authority to \u2013 I don\u2019t know the correct legal term, but he had the authority to not accept the electors.\u201d She also said Trump called her on January 7 but they did not talk about the attack. The panel revealed during its hearings over the summer that Trump called McDaniel directly in December to tell her about the plan for a group of states to submit alternate slates of electors and connected her to his elections lawyer John Eastman, but her full transcript reveals more details about what was shared between the RNC, Trump White House and the Trump campaign at the time. In the lead-up to January 6, McDaniel testified that she did not know that the alternate slates of electors were being considered for anything other than contingent electors in case legal challenges changed state election results. She added she was not privy to a lot of those discussions and that she was going through ankle surgery around the time of the Capitol attack. McDaniel told committee investigators that after that December call, she called the Trump campaign\u2019s counsel Justin Clark, who gave her the impression that the campaign was aware of the so-called alternate elector plan and was working on it. She also testified that on December 14, when she was informed that false electors met, she sent a note to former Trump White House aide Molly Michael. As for fundraising emails from the RNC about the 2020 election, McDaniel said the RNC worked closely with Clark but that once Giuliani took over Trump\u2019s legal efforts, he \u201cwas doing his own thing and didn\u2019t really reach out to the RNC.\u201d Read the full transcript of the interview with Ronna McDaniel. A Trump campaign attorney described to the committee a request by Giuliani to be paid $20,000 per day for his post-election legal work \u2013 a request that Giuliani has denied making. Matthew Morgan, who was general counsel for former President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, described to the committee how the campaign handled requests by Giuliani and his team \u2013 which took over the campaign\u2019s litigation strategy in mid-November 2020 \u2013 to bring on outside attorneys and firms. \u201cRudy Giuliani himself, he requested an engagement letter, and he requested through a surrogate what was viewed as a large amount of compensation,\u201d Morgan said, according to a transcript of an April interview that was made public Sunday. \u201cAnd when I presented this to (Trump deputy campaign manager) Justin Clark, Justin Clark didn\u2019t think that was a number the campaign was willing to pay and I relied on then Justin to tell me if we could do such an engagement letter and then it never materialized.\u201d Morgan told the House committee the ask was made via an associate of Giuliani\u2019s, Maria Ryan, and that it was for $20,000 per day. He declined to answer further questions from the committee about the pushback from the campaign to the request. CNN previously reported that Giuliani was asking for $20,000-per-day in November 2020, citing a source. At the time, Giuliani denied to The New York Times that he was seeking that figure. Read the full transcript of the interview with Matthew Morgan. Trump White House aides offered conflicting accounts of how the former president reacted when he learned he would not be taken to the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. While Cassidy Hutchinson, in her testimony, described Trump\u2019s reaction as an angry outburst, Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Engel \u2013 the lead agent in Trump\u2019s motorcade the day of the riot \u2013 apparently told others in the White House that Trump simply \u201cshrugged it off\u201d when he was told he would not be taken to the Capitol. When Engel returned to the White House after Trump\u2019s January 6 speech, he stopped by the office shared by former White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato and William \u201cBeau\u201d Harrison, the special assistant to the president for operations. \u201cIt was brought to our attention that the President asked where am I going. You know, am I going \u2013 am I going back to the White House. And Bob said, yeah, you know, we\u2019re going back to the White House,\u201d Harrison told committee investigators in an August 2022 interview, according to the transcript. \u201cAnd at that point I have a specific memory of Bobby telling both Tony and myself, as we were in the room, no one else was in the room, that the President almost kind of shrugged it off,\u201d Harrison told the committee. \u201cHe just kind of moved on.\u201d Harrison told congressional investigators he had never heard of a heated argument in the vehicle until he saw Hutchinson\u2019s testimony on television. \u201cI would also add that, if something like had been described had occurred, I 100 percent would have known about it and would have heard that.\u201d When Hutchinson testified, Harrison got a call from Ornato. Ornato said, essentially, \u201cCan you believe this?\u201d and \u201cWhere is this story even coming from,\u201d according to Harrison\u2019s committee transcript. Notably, Harrison told investigators he was not paying for his legal representation and was not sure who was footing the bill. Harrison\u2019s attorney for his committee interview was Stefan Passantino, who previously represented Hutchinson and allegedly encouraged Hutchinson to provide misleading testimony. Passantino has insisted he represented Hutchinson \u201chonorably\u201d and \u201cethically.\u201d Read the full transcript of the interview with Beau Harrison. Kenneth Chesebro \u2013 the Trump attorney described by the House January 6 committee as the architect of the post-2020 election fake electors scheme \u2013 declined to answer the bulk of the panel\u2019s questions in an October deposition, according to a transcript. Chesebro invoked both his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as well as attorney-client privilege when asked questions about a variety of topics, including his interactions with Trump, his role in the plot to put forward Trump electors to rival the Biden electors in states that Biden won and the push to have Pence disrupt Congress\u2019 certification of Biden\u2019s win. \u201cI believe my Fifth Amendment privilege covers this entire subject matter in terms of any involvement with the alternate electors,\u201d Chesebro said at one point in the deposition. At its start, his lawyer referenced the criminal probes in Fulton County, Georgia, and by the Justice Department, which are both looking closely at the fake electors scheme. Chesebro did answer some of the committee\u2019s more abstract questions about how he learned of the legal questions that shaped the theories he promoted after the 2020 election. However, citing the Fifth Amendment, he refused to say whether he went to the White House on December 16, 2020, as suggested by an email obtained by the committee, or if he was in Washington, DC, on January 6, 2021. He also refused to confirm that he was the Kenneth Chesebro listed on some emails obtained by the committee that investigators sought to ask him about. \u201cI think I would take the Fifth in terms of authenticating a document that is related to the subject matter as to which I\u2019m taking the Fifth,\u201d he said. Read the full transcript of the interview with Kenneth Chesebro. As rioters were breaking into the Capitol on January 6, Trump called his executive assistant, Molly Michael, to ask her what she thought and she described the scene that was unfolding, according to a transcript of her interview with the committee. \u201cThe President of the United States in the middle of a riot at the Capitol calls you and asks you what you think, not what you see but what you think, and you don\u2019t recall what you told him other than just reporting what was on TV?\u201d investigators asked. \u201cThe TV is very large, and the coverage was on probably all four of the stations. So that was really all I was seeing,\u201d Michael said. \u201cThe images I was seeing is the predominant memory I have.\u201d Committee investigators pressed her for more details on how Trump reacted during their call. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember him expressing any distress, any frustration, any anger, any anything. Is that right?\u201d investigators asked. Michael responded, \u201cThe phones were ringing. A lot was happening. I don\u2019t recall.\u201d Michael\u2019s lengthy interview transcript was heavy with moments she did not recall, such as Trump\u2019s demeanor at the end of the day on January 6. When congressional investigators asked Michael if she was aware in the run up to January 6 of a \u201cvery serious, acrimonious conflict\u201d between Trump and Pence, Michael said she couldn\u2019t recall but there were often heated conversations playing out in the Oval Office. Her committee interview also revealed more details about Trump\u2019s activities the night before the Capitol attack, when he was apparently directing his assistant to share election fraud claims with GOP senators. Trump directed Michael to send Sens. Lindsey Graham and Josh Hawley a document entitled \u201cThe Art of the Steal\u201d \u2013 apparently authored by Navarro \u2013 on the evening of January 5, according to emails investigators reviewed with Michael during her committee interview. Congressional investigators asked Michael about the emails, which she sent on Trump\u2019s behalf with the subject line \u201cFrom POTUS.\u201d Read the full transcript of the interview with Molly Michael.

Read more opinion at CNN. The news of former President Donald Trump\u2019s indictment has left me feeling torn. On the one hand, Trump is a walking advertisement for rich privilege. For decades he has flouted rules, norms and even laws as he climbed his way to the top, brazenly convinced that the usual standards didn\u2019t apply to him. His company was found guilty of tax fraud, he\u2019s been taken to court countless times over unpaid bills, and he\u2019s even stolen money from his own charities. For those who saw Jon Stewart on \u201cGPS\u201d last week, that was the gist of his passionate argument. Jon was certainly right that the law should not care about the popularity of a person or the political effect of an indictment \u2014 and no one can really be sure what that effect will be in the long run anyway. Trump's indictment answers a 50-year-old question And yet this case is not simply one of the law in all its impartial majesty holding someone to account. The prosecutor, Alvin Bragg, is an elected district attorney who ran a campaign for that office boasting that he had helped sue Donald Trump \u201cmore than a hundred times.\u201d Even so, once elected and after looking over the evidence, he is reported to have put the case on the back burner, which triggered a storm of criticism from his Democratic base. He then reversed course and decided to pursue the case on a new basis, if reported accounts are correct, which goes like this: Trump\u2019s offense is to have violated New York state law by falsifying business records, but the statute of limitations for that misdemeanor has expired. So Bragg\u2019s office will argue that the misdemeanor is actually tied to a felony because it violates federal election laws. But that violation is one that the Justice Department under both Trump and President Joe Biden looked at and decided against prosecution. That is, as many experts have pointed out, a novel legal theory. I should note that Trump denies any wrongdoing. Given the circumstances, this case has the feel of zealous prosecutors minutely examining all possibilities to find some violation of the law. This upends the notion in Anglo-Saxon law that you first have a crime and then search for the criminal, rather than first looking at the person and searching to see if he or she has committed a crime. How the courts will deal with indicted Donald Trump Many Republicans have darkly prophesied that this is a watershed moment in American history and will unleash a torrent of indictments by state prosecutors against national politicians whom they dislike. Perhaps, but they seem to have forgotten that they have been instrumental in developing this weaponization of the legal system. The Wall Street Journal huffed and puffed last week, \u201cAs these columns have made clear, we believe any prosecution of a former President should involve a serious offense.\u201d Really? The Wall Street Journal filled six volumes with over 3,000 pages of editorials endorsing the crazy Whitewater-related investigation of a sitting president. For those who have forgotten, Whitewater was a failed land deal in which Bill and Hillary Clinton lost money, which triggered a special prosecutor, who found nothing he could use to prosecute them on that matter, but in the course of the investigation learned that Bill Clinton had had a sexual relationship with a White House intern, which he then used to ask Clinton questions that he figured the president would answer dishonestly \u2014 leading to a perjury charge. A serious crime? The Journal\u2019s standard is the right one, however, and the truth is, Trump is likely to face just such charges soon. In Georgia, he quite possibly could be prosecuted for having threatened Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d the 11,000-odd votes he needed to win that state in 2020. And then there is the January 6, 2021, uprising in which he could easily be charged by federal prosecutors with an effort to overturn an election.  Trying a former president breaks centuries of precedent, but he should be tried if the offenses themselves are likewise precedent-shattering, and those election-related ones are. Paying hush money to cover up an affair, however, is not at that level. And I worry that the far more serious cases against Trump will get lumped together with the Stormy Daniels affair as just more efforts to find something to bring Trump down. The rule of law is pursued not simply to punish people but to create a system of self-government that is widely viewed as legitimate. The hush money case will captivate the country. And if the rumors about the charges facing him are true, Trump is probably guilty. But will it create more or less faith in our judicial system and our democratic system? That is the worry that leads me to conclude that this is a case of trying the right man for the wrong crime.",

The news of a potential indictment would likely derail most presidential candidates. But former President Donald Trump isn\u2019t most presidential candidates, and we\u2019ve seen him thrive in politically challenging environments before. Ever since Trump announced last week that he would be indicted in New York, where a grand jury has been hearing evidence about an alleged scheme to falsify records to conceal hush money payments to an adult-film star, we have been waiting to learn his legal fate. But it seems New York is not his only cause for concern. Trump\u2019s legal troubles could be ramping up elsewhere, with an appeals court ruling that Trump\u2019s defense attorney must testify before a grand jury investigating the handling of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago and Georgia prosecutors considering potential racketeering and conspiracy charges in connection to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election in the Peach State. However, it\u2019s worth remembering that the former president has already survived two impeachments, numerous investigations and countless controversies before. Given what he\u2019s gone through, and how he\u2019s established his political persona, an indictment that might end other political careers is not an inevitable body blow for Trump. Opinion: What the rest of the world realizes about prosecuting former presidents In fact, numerous commentators, including Democratic officials, are rightly speculating that an indictment in the New York case could end up strengthening Trump\u2019s hand going into 2024. Based on this perspective, it was not surprising that Trump himself announced (incorrectly) on Truth Social that he would be arrested on Tuesday, calling on his supporters to protest such a move. Privately, according to the New York Times, he has been considering how a \u201cperp walk\u201d might be perceived. And while Trump\u2019s political brand has struggled in the past few months, recent polls show him leading the pack of potential Republican presidential candidates \u2014 with a significant gulf between him and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. So, why might Trump gain further strength if he is indicted? Trump\u2019s legal troubles play directly into the ways he has packaged himself as a politician. For one, Trump thrives on media attention. This is his major weapon in political combat. He loves to dominate the news cycle, redirect national conversations, lash out at his enemies and eclipse all other issues. Trump, who has an instinctive feel for the rhythms of cable television and social media, did it again this week. As war rages in Ukraine and US officials try to contain a potential fallout in the banking sector, there\u2019s been considerable coverage of his possible arrest after his Truth Social post this weekend. It doesn\u2019t seem to matter that much of the attention is negative. As president, reality television star and real estate mogul, Trump has cast himself as a fighter who has warded off individuals and institutions that he claims are out to get him. This is an essential part of his political persona: the aggrieved public figure who is at perpetual war with the world around him. Opinion: Trump left Georgia's GOP in ruins -- and now faces the consequences In a manner that would make President Richard Nixon supremely jealous, Trump knows how to weaponize attacks like nobody else, turning on his opposition and making the case to supporters that his adversaries are the ones who are abusing power. He used this strategy with former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton (\u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d), the media (\u201cfake news\u201d), former FBI Director James Comey (\u201cSlippery James Comey\u201d) and former Special Counsel Robert Mueller (\u201crigged Mueller Witch Hunt\u201d), to name a few examples. Trump went even bigger when he took aim at the entire election system after Joe Biden won the presidency in 2020. Most recently, he called Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg a \u201cwoke tyrant.\u201d Trump uses this to connect with Republican voters, many of whom are White men in rural areas who feel as if the world has left them behind. This allows Trump \u2014 a man of wealth, power and privilege \u2014 to paint himself as being \u201canti-establishment,\u201d a message that continues to resonate in a post-Watergate America. As a result, Trump relates to his supporters, making the case that he is fighting against the forces they are up against as well. It appears Trump\u2019s strategy is still effective, as Republicans have rallied to his defense in a Pavlovian fashion. The airwaves this past week have been filled with Republicans playing their familiar roles. It only took a few days after Trump\u2019s social media announcement for Republican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio to further weaponize the House Judiciary Committee by calling for an investigation into Bragg. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, seemingly unable to separate himself from Trump, accused Bragg of unfair treatment, saying, \u201cLawyer after lawyer will tell you this is the weakest case out there, trying to make a misdemeanor a felony.\u201d Opinion: DeSantis takes a risk on Trump And then there is a part of Trump that has always loved the tough-guy, mob boss image. Professional wrestling fans will remember the gusto with which he embraced the fighting spectacle and the connections he forged to the world of professional boxing. As someone who rose to prominence in New York in the 1970s and 1980s, he is not deterred by the idea that many Americans are more likely to see him as a character out of \u201cThe Godfather\u201d or \u201cGoodfellas\u201d than someone who belongs in the West Wing. As I wrote in 2016, this suits the cultural era of the anti-hero and allows Trump to revel in the tough bravado that comes with that role. And shortly after he entered the Oval Office, he surrounded himself with military officials who bolstered his image as a man of strength. To top it all off, Trump, who does not seem to feel any sense of shame, appears to have insulated himself from the psychological pressure that others might feel to step down in the face of controversy and scandal. Put all of this together and it becomes easier to understand why an indictment might not be the worst thing to happen to the former president. It must also be said that an alleged relationship with a porn star, which Trump denies having, may no longer be an automatically disqualifying issue the way that it used to be. It\u2019s also worth noting that this allegation about his personal life seems to pale in comparison to the full-throated campaign to reverse the will of the electorate and undermine our democratic system in 2020. Whether or not someone benefits from an investigation or indictment should have no bearing on those who work on behalf of the law and the Constitution. And regardless of the outcome of the many investigations, they are \u2014 contrary to what Trump may claim \u2014 worthy pursuits of justice.  Ultimately, voters can still respond how they like in 2024, since an indictment or conviction would not bar Trump from becoming president again. While there are many factors that will determine whether we can reestablish the many guardrails that have disappeared in American politics, the electorate will be of utmost importance when it comes time to decide who should be given the responsibility of inhabiting the Oval Office. On Election Day in 2020, Americans proved that Trump could be defeated. If an indictment, or several indictments, come down in the next few months, voters \u2014 not courts and not prosecutors \u2014 will once again be the ultimate judges of his political fate.",

He is the author of \u201cLincoln and the Fight for Peace.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Don\u2019t underestimate Tim Scott. This week, the South Carolina Republican Senator embarked on the obligatory Iowa listening tour that precedes a possible presidential campaign. He offered up a well-scripted speech in Des Moines and then led the Polk County Lincoln Day dinner, testing out the themes that could define a candidacy. If you glanced at the headlines, you might think that he was selling a warmed over form of Trump\u2019s \u201ccombative vision,\u201d served with a side order of DeSantis\u2019 bitter culture war assaults. That would be a mistake. Because if you actually listened to Scott\u2019s speeches, you\u2019d hear a very different pitch to voters. \u201cFor America to be at our best, we have to work together,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWe must come together on a common ground, built on common sense.\u201d Yes, Tim Scott is an unapologetic conservative. He is a person whose religious faith genuinely defines his personal journey and his politics. That may or may not be your policy preference. But his vision is fundamentally optimistic, a rebuke to grievance politics on the left and (implicitly) the right. He is not fanning the flames of fear about \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d He is not wielding the American flag as a weapon to bludgeon people who look different than him. Amid a wave of strategically induced CRT panic, he is also not trying to whitewash American history to pretend it is an unadulterated story of perfection. Opinion: Bernie Sanders is right about capitalism At the Lincoln Day dinner, he told the story of how his beloved grandfather, born in 1921, was taught to step aside on the sidewalk to let a white man pass and never make eye contact. This was deep in the Jim Crow South. \u201cSo when I talk about our history, I\u2019m not whitewashing it,\u201d Scott said. But he added that his grandfather told him \u201cyou can be bitter \u2013 or you can be better. I chose better.\u201d As the only Black Republican Senator, Scott sees his remarkable rise as evidence of American exceptionalism and our success in forming a more perfect union. And as inherently unique as it is, Scott\u2019s story is not one that can simply be dismissed out of hand. But he is ready to have his patriotism attacked. \u201cFor those of you on the left, you can call me a prop, you can call me a token, you can call me the N-word, you can question my Blackness, you can even call me \u2018Uncle Tim.\u2019 Just understand: Your words are no match for my evidence. The truth of my life disproves your lies.\u201d Opinion: Ron DeSantis abandons former First Amendment defense That\u2019s a good line. It\u2019s also a hard truth rooted in his personal experience. And he is unsparing in his belief that activists try to use our nation\u2019s historic mistakes as a wedge to \u201cbring more power and more resources to their progressive agenda.\u201d You can contest this all day long with stats and facts about systemic racism and its expression in everything from police abuse to housing. Scott might even agree when it comes to certain policies. But his place on the stage as a Black Republican US Senator preaching the need for national unity to achieve national greatness goes a long way toward repudiating the white identity politics that fueled much of Trump\u2019s rise. To be sure, he is still trying to appeal to a party that fell under Trump\u2019s spell \u2013 and Scott does go too far with the play-to-the-base red meat for my taste at times.  For example, his talk of how left-wing Democrats are deliberately trying to \u201cdestroy America\u201d fundamentally undercuts his overall rhetoric about the need to unite America. And he is part of the conservative crew that is dancing around the outright denunciation of Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to overturn an election on the basis of a lie \u2013 a stance that will look as cowardly in the future as it may look pragmatic now, from the perspective of someone running for president as a Republican. But trying to slap a cynical Trump-derivative bumper sticker on Tim Scott does him a disservice. Because Scott\u2019s optimistic pitch for possible presidential campaign is evidence that there is a lane outside of Trump, Trump Lite and Never Trump.
