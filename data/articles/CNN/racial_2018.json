            "article_content": "A US judicial council on Tuesday dismissed 83 complaints that had been lodged against new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, arising largely from statements he made during his contentious September confirmation hearings. In a 10-page order, the judicial council of a Denver-based US appeals court said the complaints \u2013 the first of which were referred to the court by Chief Justice John Roberts on October 10 \u2013 could not be acted on because Kavanaugh, as a justice, is no longer covered by the judiciary\u2019s misconduct rules. Tenth US Circuit Court of Appeals Chief Judge Timothy Tymkovich, who wrote the council\u2019s order, noted that the complaints alleged that Kavanaugh had made false statements in his September hearings, as well as at earlier nomination proceedings before the Senate Judiciary Committee, in 2004 and 2006 when he was up for an appeals court seat on the District of Columbia Circuit. The complaints generally alleged that Kavanaugh had voiced inappropriate partisan statements, demonstrating bias and a lack of judicial temperament, and had treated members of the Senate Judiciary Committee disrespectfully. \u201cThe allegations contained in the complaints are serious,\u201d Tymkovich wrote, \u201cbut the Judicial Council is obligated to adhere to the Act. Lacking statutory authority to do anything more, the complaints must be dismissed because an intervening event \u2013 Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court \u2013 has made the complaints no longer appropriate for consideration under the Act.\u201d That resolution was not a surprise. Legal experts had earlier observed that the 1980 law covering judicial misconduct excludes the nine Supreme Court justices. Yet the action closes out one more chapter of the confirmation hearings that consumed the nation\u2019s capital for several weeks and reverberated in November\u2019s midterm elections. Kavanaugh, who built a solidly conservative record as an appeals court judge, succeeded retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, a conservative centrist who often cast the crucial vote on social policy issues, for example, to uphold abortion rights, to endorse racial affirmative action on campus and to declare a right to same-sex marriage. Legal experts previously noted that Congress chose not to include Supreme Court justices in the law because of their position at the top of the third branch of government under the Constitution. When the Judicial Conduct and Disability Act was passed in 1980, experts said, members of Congress were concerned that it might have appeared unseemly for the justices to fall under the authority of any lower court disciplinary panel. Gabe Roth, director of the watchdog group Fix the Court, said in a statement, \u201cToday\u2019s decision underscores the need for the Supreme Court to adopt its own code of conduct or for Congress to write one if the justices cannot be bothered.\u201d A Supreme Court spokeswoman said Kavanaugh had no comment on the council\u2019s action. Asked for reaction soon after the order came Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, a Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee who clashed repeatedly with Kavanaugh at the hearings, called the decision \u201cstunning\u201d but declined to elaborate because he wants to read the council\u2019s findings first. The council\u2019s order Tuesday said anyone who had filed complaints could petition for review within the next 42 days. But the judiciary\u2019s past practices excluding Supreme Court justices make it unlikely any appeal would be successful. For Supreme Court justices, the only route to removal is impeachment and conviction by Congress. That has never occurred for a high court justice, and it is rare even for lower court judges. In the past three decades, only three lower court judges have been impeached by the House and convicted by the Senate. In those situations, the offenses were related to bribery and perjury. Kavanaugh, who had served for 12 years on the DC Circuit, won the life-tenured seat after a bitter partisan fight and a 50-48 Senate vote on October 6. Senate Democrats criticized his conservative positions on the law during the first round of hearings, but the more volatile session came when Christine Blasey Ford, now a professor at Palo Alto University, accused the nominee of sexually assaulting her at a party when they were both in high school. She said he had been drinking alcohol. Kavanaugh denied her claims and sharply criticized Democratic senators as they questioned him. In one notable moment that was the subject of several of the complaints filed, Kavanaugh turned the tables on Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota when she asked him if he had ever blacked out from drinking. \u201cHave you?\u201d he responded angrily. During the televised hearing, Kavanaugh also asserted that Ford\u2019s allegations had arisen from \u201ca calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election \u2026 revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\u201d The former President George W. Bush aide who previously served with independent counsel Ken Starr\u2019s investigation of President Bill Clinton also asserted, \u201cAs we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around.\u201d Kavanaugh later wrote an essay for the Wall Street Journal, acknowledging, \u201cI was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said.\u201d The allegations handled on Tuesday, by Tymkovich and seven other appellate and district judges, stretched from Kavanaugh\u2019s time as a nominee for the DC Circuit more than a decade ago to his explosive testimony after Ford made her allegations public. According to the order, \u201cthe complaints generally allege that Justice Kavanaugh in his appearances before the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2026 falsely testified about his involvement in various events or programs while he was Assistant White House Counsel and Secretary to the President during the George W. Bush administration; \u2026 falsely testified about his personal conduct, behavior, and recollection of events prior to his joining the federal judiciary; and \u2026 displayed partisan bias and a lack of appropriate judicial temperament.\u201d A review of the 83 complaints reveals that some dated back more than a decade, alleging that Kavanaugh had lied about the Bush administration\u2019s anti-terrorism policies and his involvement with controversial judicial nominees during that tenure. But most of the complaints targeted his impassioned and seemingly vengeful statements, repeatedly noting his assertion that \u201cwhat goes around comes around.\u201d He was also accused of misrepresenting his history of alcohol consumption. The vast majority questioned his judicial temperament. One allegation deemed his testimony \u201cevasive, aggressive and condescending. When questioned by female Senators he acted like a bully, often interrupting and improperly posing questions to his interrogator.\u201d A separate review of Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate testimony also dissolved. The American Bar Association had said it was re-evaluating the \u201cwell qualified\u201d rating it had previously given him because of the sexual assault allegations and his response during September 27 testimony. But the group ended its review after the Senate confirmed Kavanaugh on October 6. Separately on Tuesday, Tymkovich declined to recuse himself from the case arising from a complaint that Kavanaugh had advocated for Tymkovich\u2019s confirmation to the 10th Circuit in 2003, when Kavanaugh worked for Bush. \u201cThe source for the allegations appears to be documents provided to the Senate Judiciary Committee during Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearing,\u201d Tymkovich wrote. \u201cA search of those documents reveals only that Justice Kavanaugh sent an email shortly after I was confirmed proposing a press release about numerous judicial nominees, one of whom was me. I am otherwise unaware that Justice Kavanaugh had any participation in my nomination or confirmation.\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Monday that it was \u201cgratifying\u201d to read two Senate Intelligence Committee reports on the scope of Russian misinformation campaigns, because they reiterated the intelligence community\u2019s 2017 findings. The two reports, both commissioned by the committee, were based on troves of data \u2013 much of it not disclosed publicly \u2013 about the Russian campaign to influence the 2016 US presidential election that Facebook, Twitter and Google gave lawmakers. One concluded that trolls made over 40 phony Twitter accounts and websites purporting to represent news outlets or political groups, and the other found that the Internet Research Agency, a Russian government-linked troll group, was active on many social media platforms working to help Trump win. When asked by CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d if he was surprised by the continued attacks on American elections, Clapper replied, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d \u201cIt was very gratifying for me to read about these reports, because they simply reinforce or buttress what we said in our intelligence community assessment in January of 2017,\u201d he added. The 2017 report found that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d designed to hurt then-Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 election. \u201cThe first objective of the Russians was to sow doubt, discord and discontent in this country, and they\u2019ve succeeded to it fairly well \u2013 capitalizing and exploiting the polarization and divisiveness in this country,\u201d Clapper said. \u201cSecondarily, of course, was to do all they could to damage Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy and to help, when he became serious as the nominee, Donald Trump,\u201d he added. Clapper added that Russian cyberattacks had continued since the 2016 election because of the \u201copportunity to drive a wedge among\u201d Americans on a variety of hot-button issues, including racial tensions and gun rights. \u201cThey had messages for everybody in the campaign, whether it was Black Lives Matter, white supremacists, gun control advocates, Second Amendment advocates,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Russians are always looking for issues to exploit to their advantage.\u201d",

            "article_content": "With Democrats set to take control of the House in January, speculation abounds about whether the new majority would impeach the President. Americans break against that idea, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Half, 50%, say they don\u2019t feel that Trump ought to be impeached and removed from office, while 43% say he should be. Support for impeachment has dipped some since September, when 47% favored it, and is about the same as in a June poll (42% favored it then). Support for impeachment of Trump remains higher than it was for each of the last three presidents at any time it was asked. It\u2019s on par with President Richard Nixon, who 43% of Americans said should be impeached and removed from office in a March 1974 Harris poll. We're a long, long, long way from a real impeachment effort The shift on impeachment comes mostly from political independents. In September, they were evenly split on the question, with 48% behind impeachment and 47% opposed. Now, 36% favor impeachment and 55% are opposed. There\u2019s also been a meaningful shift on the question among younger adults (53% of those under age 45 backed impeachment in September, now that\u2019s down to 45%) and racial and ethnic minorities (66% favored it in September, 50% do now). Related: Full poll results Trump himself warned his supporters during the 2016 midterm campaign that Democrats would try to impeach him, although Democratic leaders like soon-to-be House Speaker Nancy Pelsoi have dismissed the idea. More recently, Trump has been worrying about the prospect, according to reporting by CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, as a number of his former associates cooperate with the special counsel investigation into possible collusion by Trump\u2019s campaign with Russians interfering in the 2016 election. Nadler: Trump payments are 'impeachable offense' The incoming Democratic chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler of New York, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that if allegations by Michael Cohen that Trump directed him to issue illegal payments to women alleging affairs to keep them quiet during the 2016 election were true, those would constitute \u201cimpeachable offenses.\u201d At the same time, Nadler made no suggestion Democrats would pursue impeachment against Trump. One reason Democrats might not impeach Trump even if he is ultimately implicated by special counsel Robert Mueller is that while they control the House, and so could potentially impeach him in that chamber with a simple majority, Republicans will still control of the US Senate. It would require the defection of 20 Republican senators to remove Trump from office if he were impeached by Democrats in the House. That defection among the President\u2019s partisans failed to happened when Republicans in the House impeached Bill Clinton in the late 1990s. There were nowhere near the 67 votes needed in the Senate to remove Clinton from office. Trump, however, is not nearly as popular now as Clinton was then. Clinton reached more than 70% approval when the House voted to impeach him in December of 1998, according to CNN/Gallup/USA Today polling. Former President Richard Nixon, who resigned rather than be impeached, had a much lower approval rating than Trump has now. He was under 30% approval when he resigned in August of 1974. Trump\u2019s approval rating has remained remarkably steady, in the high 30s and low 40s \u2013 much less than Clinton, but much higher than Nixon. All of this remains academic since Democratic leaders have not expressed any interest in impeaching Trump. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS December 6 through 9 among a random national sample of 1,015 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, it is larger for subgroups.",

            "article_content": "The Boston Globe published a searing editorial Thursday pouring cold water on the prospects of a presidential run for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in 2020, a stark contrast to the paper\u2019s call for her to seek the White House three years ago. \u201cWhile Warren is an effective and impactful senator with an important voice nationally, she has become a divisive figure,\u201d the Globe editorial reads. \u201cA unifying voice is what the country needs now after the polarizing politics of Donald Trump.\u201d The Globe, based in the state Warren represents, writes: \u201cWarren missed her moment in 2016, and there\u2019s reason to be skeptical of her\u00a0prospective candidacy\u00a0in 2020.\u201d Warren, a progressive who is widely expected to launch a presidential bid, faced criticism when she unveiled a video in October aimed at putting to rest questions about whether she has Native American heritage. The attempt to stand up to President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks \u2013 he repeatedly calls her \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2013 seems to have backfired. The New York Times reported Thursday, \u201cAdvisers close to Ms. Warren say she has privately expressed concern that she may have damaged her relationships to Native American groups and her own standing with activists, particularly those who are racial minorities.\u201d In 2015 the Globe ran an editorial urging Warren to run for president in the 2016 election, \u201cin part,\u201d it writes, \u201cbecause of the lack of serious competition against Hillary Clinton.\u201d The Globe notes in 2020, lack of competition on the Democratic side \u201cwon\u2019t be a problem.\u201d The Globe notes Republican Gov. Charlie Baker won more votes than Warren in Massachusetts \u2013 a state, the paper writes, that is \u201csupposed to be a Democratic haven.\u201d The editorial also pointed to a September poll that indicated voters in Massachusetts were more enthusiastic about former Gov. Deval Patrick running for president. \u201cThose are warning signs from the voters who know her best,\u201d the Globe writes. Patrick had the backing of some top aides from President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 and 2012 campaigns and had built a small but formidable team of advisers in Boston as he planned a 2020 bid. The former governor announced Thursday he will not run for president in 2020, and cited the \u201ccruelty of our elections process\u201d and the effect it would have on those close to him. Many factors went into Patrick\u2019s decision, people close to Patrick tell CNN, but one key reason was that his wife Diane had recently been diagnosed with uterine cancer and had surgery right before Thanksgiving, a source familiar with the governor\u2019s thinking said. The Globe writes, \u201cDeval Patrick knew when to call it quits on a presidential bid. Other politicians take note.\u201d The paper added that deciding to not run for president can be \u201charder\u201d than running for president. \u201cPoliticians who \u2018explore\u2019 or \u2018consider\u2019 presidential campaigns set in motion a machine that can be hard to stop,\u201d the editorial writes. \u201cPatrick did, and that\u2019s to his credit. There\u2019s no shame in testing the waters and deciding to stay on the beach.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Almost two years after President Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election, and just weeks away from the midterms, comedy legends Dave Chappelle and Jon Stewart laid bare their thoughts on the state of their nation, and warned against ascribing racial or class divisions purely to President Trump\u2019s election, or Russian meddling. \u201cEven when they say that Russia influenced the election,\u201d Chappelle said, \u201cit\u2019s kind of like, is Russia making us racist? Is that who\u2019s doing it? Oh OK, oh my God, thank goodness \u2013 I thought it was us.\u201d \u201cIf they killed the country that way then we\u2019re the murder weapon,\u201d he joked. In an exclusive interview with Christiane Amanpour for her program on CNN International and PBS, Chappelle said President Trump gets \u201ctoo much credit\u201d for defining the era. \u201cHe\u2019s not making the wave, he\u2019s surfing it.\u201d Just days after Election Day 2016, Chappelle delivered \u201cSaturday Night Live\u2019s\u201d opening monologue. \u201cI\u2019m going to give him a chance,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cAnd we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too.\u201d It was the \u201cright thing at the right time\u201d to say, he now opines. \u201cI\u2019m a black American, so we\u2019ve \u2013 these feelings that people felt right after the election, we\u2019ve felt them, many elections consecutively. And to some degree, people overreacted. The alternative to giving him a chance was storming the street.\u201d But two years on from that olive branch, the comedian spoke with less optimism. \u201cIs he doing a good job? Am I happy with what he\u2019s doing? No, it\u2019s been very difficult to watch the last couple of years.\u201d After an impromptu joint show last year on the day of a neo-Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, the two comics have teamed up for a global comedy tour tackling some of America\u2019s darkest challenges, including gun violence and the opioid crisis. Stewart, too, said \u201cthere was a part of me\u201d that hoped being in the White House would transform the person Trump had been as a candidate. In reality, he now says, \u201cI imagine he walked in that room \u2013 he\u2019s like, \u2018Take that down, take that down, put up dogs playing poker. Can a fellow get some French fries around here?\u2019\u201d \u201cOddly enough, he transformed the White House, and the White House wasn\u2019t able to transform him.\u201d Stewart did not reserve his criticism solely for the President. Pointing fingers at the press, the former \u201cDaily Show\u201d host lamented the ongoing clashes between the White House and the media, arguing that reporting on their own war of words with the White House distracts Americans from the damaging consequences of his policies. \u201cI\u2019m less interested in his insults and more interested in his injuries \u2013 in the people that are being hurt, not the people that are being insulted,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThey are personally offended and wounded by this man. He baits them and they dive in.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith will win Mississippi\u2019s US Senate runoff election, CNN projects, in a contest that centered on her actions and comments evoking the state\u2019s dark history of racism and slavery. Hyde-Smith will defeat Democratic challenger Mike Espy, a former congressman and agriculture secretary, in the last Senate race to be decided in 2018. The victory will make her the first woman ever elected to Congress from Mississippi. Her win on Tuesday means Republicans will hold 53 seats to Democrats\u2019 47 seats in the Senate in January. The GOP grew its majority in the Senate by two seats in this year\u2019s midterm elections even as Democrats took control of the House. Hyde-Smith\u2019s victory also means that there will be 24 women in the Senate next year. That will set a new record for women serving in the Senate, one more than the current high, set during this Congress. Hyde-Smith will finish out the final two years of former Sen. Thad Cochran\u2019s term, who retired earlier this year due to health concerns. Hyde-Smith will have to run again in 2020 to serve a full six-year term. RELATED: A political blockade is colliding with the evidence on climate change President Donald Trump visited Mississippi on Monday to rally Republican voters behind Hyde-Smith after her comments about a \u201cpublic hanging\u201d set off weeks of controversy. It began when video emerged online of her telling supporters earlier this month that she\u2019d be \u201con the front row\u201d if one of her supporters \u201cinvited me to a public hanging.\u201d She later called the comments an \u201cexaggerated expression of regard,\u201d but her use of the phrase brought memories of Mississippi\u2019s history of lynchings to the forefront and put the contest under the national microscope. Asked about her remark in a debate, Hyde-Smith said she would \u201ccertainly apologize\u201d to anyone who was offended, but then pivoted to an attack on her opponent. \u201cThis comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me,\u201d Hyde-Smith said. The race to control the Senate in 2020 has already started Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments prompted deeper dives into her history. The same progressive blogger who published the video of her using the phrase \u201cpublic hanging\u201d later published one in which Hyde-Smith told a small group at Mississippi State University that suppressing the votes of students at other colleges was \u201ca great thing.\u201d Her campaign said it was a joke, but that explanation backfired when the black student seen laughing in a picture from the event her campaign posted on Twitter responded that Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign was using him as a prop. On Friday, the Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith had attended a private high school that was founded in 1970 so that white parents could avoid attempts to integrate public schools. Hyde-Smith\u2019s daughter later attended a similar private school established around the same time, according to the Free Press. The senator\u2019s campaign responded to the report by attacking the \u201cliberal media.\u201d Over the weekend, CNN reported that Hyde-Smith once promoted a measure that praised a Confederate soldier\u2019s effort to \u201cdefend his homeland\u201d and had pushed a revisionist view of the Civil War. In photos posted to her Facebook account in 2014, Hyde-Smith was pictured posing with Confederate artifacts during a visit to Beauvoir, the home and library of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The caption on the post read, \u201cMississippi history at its best!\u201d Democrats had hoped a surge in turnout among black voters \u2013 who make up nearly 40% of Mississippi\u2019s population, the largest share in the nation \u2013 could carry Espy to victory in a state that is highly polarized along racial lines, with most white voters backing GOP candidates and black voters supporting Democrats. Espy\u2019s campaign hammered Hyde-Smith with television ads that cast her as an embarrassment to a state that has attempted to overcome its history of slavery and racism. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to overcome the stereotypes that hurt our economy and cost us jobs. Her words should not reflect Mississippi\u2019s values, either,\u201d a narrator said in one ad. The ad also called Hyde-Smith \u201cso embarrassing, she\u2019d be a disaster for Mississippi.\u201d Several companies that had donated to Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign, including Walmart, publicly withdrew their support for the senator over the \u201cpublic hanging\u201d comment. The controversies surrounding her set off a major push by national Republicans to avoid the same embarrassment they\u2019d suffered last year in Alabama over the Senate campaign of Roy Moore and save Hyde-Smith. While Hyde-Smith largely stayed off the campaign trail, the party\u2019s infrastructure rallied to her defense. GOP groups spent $4 million on the Mississippi runoff \u2013 much more than Democrats\u2019 $1.2 million, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Republican groups spent more than twice as much as Democrats on television advertisements, per the ad tracking firm Kantar/CMAG. Trump\u2019s visits to Mississippi on Monday night were also seen as bid to rally the Republican base to vote in an election taking place two days after the Thanksgiving weekend.

            "article_content": "The 2018 election officially ends today as Mississippi voters head to the polls to choose between Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith (R) and former Rep. Mike Espy (D). Hyde-Smith is considered the favorite in the runoff due to the clear Republican lean of the Magnolia State but her campaign has drawn a series of negative headlines over the past few weeks, headlines that have injected race into the, well, race. To get a sense of the lay of the land of the last Senate election of 2018, I reached out to Sam R. Hall, who is the executive editor of the Clarion Ledger, the largest paper in Mississippi. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Cillizza: It\u2019s Election Day in Mississippi. Which side feels better \u2013 and why? Hall: Hyde-Smith. She\u2019s had a rough three weeks \u2013 largely self-inflicted \u2013 but I think most of it turns out to be political flesh wounds. Mississippi is still heavily and reliably Republican. Gov. Phil Bryant and President Donald Trump are immensely popular; the rallies Monday will be a huge boost for her. And Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign has been relentless with political attack ads against Espy for three solid weeks. Espy has garnered a lot more attention because of Hyde-Smith\u2019s screw-ups, but I don\u2019t think it is anywhere near enough for him to win. If he gets within 10 points, then that would be a monumental voting shift and point toward Hyde-Smith possibly having a serious primary challenger in 2020. Cillizza: Cindy Hyde-Smith has drawn LOTS of negative national headlines over the past month. What\u2019s the reaction been like in Mississippi? Hall: Almost universally partisan. While there have been a number of Republicans who privately admit she\u2019s made major missteps, few think it\u2019s going to cost her the race. The most diverse opinions seem to center around the hanging comment. There are diehard supporters who believe it was nothing more than a turn of phrase, that she meant nothing by it and that Democrats and the \u201cliberal media\u201d are just making much out of nothing. Other supporters \u2013 and most GOP politicos with whom I\u2019ve spoken \u2013 tend to agree with much of that sentiment but also acknowledge that a) it was a stupid thing to say and b) that the response was grossly mishandled, which led to the firestorm that has engulfed her. Whoever told her she should steadfastly refuse to apologize and stubbornly point back to her initial statement should never be allowed near another campaign. The only thing that would have been worse for her campaign would have been to say, \u201cYeah, I said it, and I meant it.\u201d By letting it continue on, it gave more and more credence to every misstep or questionable issue from her past \u2013 especially to the national media. Democrats and Espy supporters seemed more shocked at the way she handled it than what she actually said. They couldn\u2019t believe that she allowed it to get so far away from her. As more questionable pieces came out, they continued to follow a narrative of an old school, Deep South Republican politician with racist world views running against a moderate African-American Democrat with a history of crossing party lines. It was a godsend for them and the kind of narrative they were honestly expecting had [former state senator] Chris McDaniel made the runoff, not Hyde-Smith. But, overall, this is Mississippi. Everyone here \u2013 Republican, Democrat and other \u2013 are desensitized to a degree about racial issues from someone\u2019s past. We still have the Confederate emblem on our state flag, despite the business community and a growing number of politicians from both parties saying it should be changed (including Sen. Roger Wicker.) It\u2019s going to take more than an off-the-cuff comment and a photo at a museum to move large swaths of the electorate. I\u2019d be remiss not to point out that Hyde-Smith doesn\u2019t have a history of racial divisiveness in her political life. There are a lot of people \u2013 Republicans and Democrats \u2013 who believe she may not have been ready for the national spotlight that came with this campaign, but they don\u2019t believe she is a bigoted racist, especially considering some of the elected officials and politicians who consistently say and embrace far worse things. Cillizza: Trump was initially skeptical of Hyde-Smith as an appointed senator. He\u2019s now all in for her \u2013 including two rallies in the state on Monday. What changed? Hall: Gov. Phil Bryant. He and the President have forged an interesting relationship. The governor was the only one who was going to persuade the President and his staff that Hyde-Smith was the candidate they needed. McDaniel is clearly more in line with the President\u2019s brand, but he sealed his fate in 2014 when he continued to challenge his defeat to Sen. Thad Cochran and refused to ever concede that race. There was real political animosity between McDaniel and state GOP leaders, including Bryant. Too, the Alabama [Senate] race scared a lot of people, and Republicans here feared a repeat of that race if McDaniel was in a runoff against a credible Democrat like Espy. That was likely a big selling point. Finally, it didn\u2019t hurt that Hyde-Smith was with Trump from the beginning. Had she not been, who knows what would have happened. Cillizza: Espy avoided highlighting some of Hyde-Smith\u2019s potential negatives \u2013 the public hanging comment, segregated schools etc. \u2013 during their debate. What explains his strategy? Hall: He did highlight the public hanging comment. His most memorable line (and, honestly, there weren\u2019t many) was when he went after her for a very late apology she read from notes: \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth.\u201d But past that, I don\u2019t think he felt like carrying the water on that attack was in his best interest, and he was probably correct. He didn\u2019t go after her as hard on racial issues as some of his supporters would have liked, but that was an extremely tricky line for him to walk. To win this race, he has to have sizable white support. If he had gone with a full-throated offensive on race-related issues, he potentially could have lost moderate whites who thought her comment was dumb and her response petty but still weren\u2019t convinced that she meant anything racist by it. He probably didn\u2019t want to be painted as a black candidate playing the race card, especially while running on a message of working with everyone regardless of race or partisan leanings. (And to his credit, he has a history of doing those things.) As for the segregated schools issue, that had not come up yet \u2013 or at least wasn\u2019t widespread. I suspect he would have approached it much the same way for the same reasons. Too, this issue is not clear-cut, either. Yes, there are a lot of private schools that were started as segregation academies, and some of them still exist today. However, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to say that they all still exist solely \u2013 and in some (many?) cases \u2013 for the same reason. Then there is the fact that Espy sent his children to a private school, too. Granted, his children went to an Episcopalian private school that did not have the same racial history, but try explaining that to voters in a 15-second soundbite in a debate or making voters care that there is a difference. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cIf Cindy Hyde-Smith wins by a comfortable margin, the lesson is _____________.\u201d Now explain. Hall: \u201cUnclear and complicated.\u201d The easy \u2013 and lazy \u2013 assumption would be that nothing has changed, that Mississippi still embraces a racist heritage. Yes, there is still a sizable portion of our electorate who do just that, but I sincerely believe they are the minority. They may still be large enough to swing some elections, but they are in the minority and continue to dwindle. (Look at the number of people who continue to come out in favor of changing the state flag to see that it\u2019s changing. Look at those running for higher office who refuse to advocate for a new flag despite their largest financial backers doing so as evidence that the racist element of our electorate is still sizable enough to matter \u2013 at least in GOP primaries.)   More importantly, however, is the fact that a number of people in Mississippi \u2013 on both ends of the political spectrum \u2013 believe the national political parties and national media got carried away. Saying you would be on the front row of a public hanging may be disturbing \u2013 it is certainly not very smart for someone running for office, especially in Mississippi \u2013 but it isn\u2019t automatically racist. Not admitting to how such a comment could be interpreted as having racial undertones and initially refusing to just apologize for anyone hurt by it and then move on was far dumber than saying it in the first place. But the political storm it set off drew clear lines in the sand that have held ever since. At the end of the day, this race was essentially decided on November 6 when Hyde-Smith drummed McDaniel and ended up matching Espy\u2019s vote total. That should have been his ceiling \u2013 41% \u2013 and the next three weeks should have been pretty mundane. Now he may surpass 41%, but to believe he is going to shoot up 10 percentage points is naive. I said right after the debate Tuesday that I felt like the runoff results would be essentially what everyone expected after the runoff was set: essentially a 60-40 win for Hyde-Smith, give or take a couple of points. I also said I would be more shocked by a 10-point race than a 30-point or higher race. While I now would be more surprised by Hyde-Smith hitting 65%, I still don\u2019t think this race is that close. Espy getting to 45% would be a strong showing, though it would likely point more toward Hyde-Smith\u2019s weakness as a candidate than his strength. All in all, don\u2019t be surprised to see a 60-40 race. For all the national attention, I don\u2019t think the needle has moved much here. This is a solidly Republican state, and for all her missteps and the very poor way she\u2019s handled the controversies, Hyde-Smith hasn\u2019t done anything that I see would cost her the race. And quite honestly, Espy hasn\u2019t really done anything that would convince a lot of people to switch to him. He\u2019s run a credible race, but just running a credible race isn\u2019t good enough for a Democrat in Mississippi. He\u2019s not done enough to motivate voters. You hear plenty of talk about voting against Hyde-Smith for various reasons, but you hear very little about voters inspired to go vote for Espy.",

A win for the GOP in Mississippi would further pad the party\u2019s majority in the Senate, even as Democrats have taken a solid majority in the House. Hyde-Smith has spent the days leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election mired in controversy that evoked the state\u2019s dark history of racism and slavery. It began when video emerged online of her telling supporters earlier this month that she\u2019d be \u201con the front row\u201d if one of her supporters \u201cinvited me to a public hanging.\u201d She later called the comments an \u201cexaggerated expression of regard,\u201d but her use of the phrase \u201cpublic hanging\u201d brought memories of Mississippi\u2019s history of lynchings to the forefront and put the contest under the national microscope. Those comments prompted deeper dives into her history. The same progressive blogger who published the video of her using the phrase \u201cpublic hanging\u201d later published one in which Hyde-Smith told a small group at Mississippi State University that suppressing the votes of students at other colleges was \u201ca great thing.\u201d Her campaign said it was a joke, but that explanation backfired when the black student seen laughing in a picture from the event her campaign posted on Twitter responded that Hyde-Smith\u2019s campaign was using him as a prop. On Friday, the Jackson Free Press reported that Hyde-Smith had attended a private high school that was founded in 1970 so that white parents could avoid attempts to integrate public schools. Hyde-Smith\u2019s daughter later attended a similar private school established around the same time, according to the Free Press. The senator\u2019s campaign responded to the report by attacking the \u201cliberal media.\u201d Over the weekend, CNN reported that Hyde-Smith once promoted a measure that praised a Confederate soldier\u2019s effort to \u201cdefend his homeland\u201d and had pushed a revisionist view of the Civil War. In photos posted to her Facebook account in 2014, Hyde-Smith was pictured posing with Confederate artifacts during a visit to Beauvoir, the home and library of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The caption on the post read, \u201cMississippi history at its best!\u201d Espy\u2019s campaign hammered Hyde-Smith with television ads that cast her as an embarrassment to a state that has attempted to overcome its history of slavery and racism. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard to overcome the stereotypes that hurt our economy and cost us jobs.

Democrats hope Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments will lead to a surge in black turnout and propel them to victory. However, even if black voters, who make up nearly 40% of the state\u2019s electorate, come out in full force, Espy would still have to outperform his party\u2019s history with whites to have a chance of winning. The state is polarized along racial lines, with most white voters backing Republicans and nearly all black voters supporting Democrats. Democrats have to overcome partisan trends in the deeply red state. Earlier this month, when multiple candidates in both parties were on the ballot, Hyde-Smith and conservative Chris McDaniel combined for 58% of the vote, while Espy and Democrat Tobey Bartee got 42%. Trump\u2019s visits to Mississippi on Monday night were also seen as bid to rally the Republican base to vote in an election taking place two days after the Thanksgiving weekend. For Democrats, the best-case scenario is similar to how Democratic Sen. Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy Moore in Alabama a year ago: a narrow victory fueled by massive turnout from black voters. But Mississippi is, in some ways, more challenging than Alabama. Moore faced allegations that, as an adult, he had sought sexual relationships with teenage girls, which Moore denied. And the state is more rural than its eastern neighbor. Like Alabama, Mississippi hasn\u2019t voted for a Democrat in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter in 1976. Trump won Mississippi by 18 percentage points in 2016.",

            "article_content": "The Mississippi Senate runoff was expected to be a quiet finale to the 2018 election season but instead has turned into a nationally watched affair. Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments about attending a \u201cpublic hanging,\u201d along with a series of other controversies, have led to critical media coverage and several companies publicly disavowing her. But while her statements and actions may make Tuesday\u2019s special Senate election a closer affair than it might otherwise have been, make no mistake: she is a heavy favorite against Democrat Mike Espy. Mississippi is as red as they come. It hasn\u2019t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter won the state in 1976. The last Democrat elected to the Senate was John Stennis in 1982. The last Democrat elected governor was Ronnie Musgrove in 1999. Mississippi Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith pushed resolution praising Confederate soldier's effort to 'defend his homeland' Mississippi\u2019s redness showed no sign of abating when voters went to the polls earlier this month. Republicans Hyde-Smith and Chris McDaniel combined for 58% of the vote in the jungle primary, while Democrats Tobey Bartee and Espy combined for 42%. That doesn\u2019t look very different from Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s 18-point 2016 victory in the state. It shouldn\u2019t be too surprising that there wasn\u2019t much movement off the 2016 baseline. Mississippi Democrats seem to have a low ceiling in Senate elections. No Democrat has come closer than 8 points to a Republican in the last 30 years. Only two Democrats have come within single digits. Democrats\u2019 inability to come close is in large part because they can\u2019t win over white voters in the state. Mississippi voters are highly polarized along racial lines. According to the 2018 exit poll, Bartee and Espy combined won only 16% of the white vote in the first round of the special election. They took 94% of the black vote. The problem for Democrats is this a pattern seen over and over again. Voters just don\u2019t shift that much in the state. In the closest Senate race in the state of the last 20 years, Musgrove earned 18% of the white vote and 92% of the black vote in the 2008 special Senate election. He lost overall by 10 points. Put another way, Espy needs to break the mold in some way. He can, for instance, win over more white voters than the traditional Mississippi Democrat does. Even if you assume Hyde-Smith\u2019s recent comments allow Espy to capture 98% of the black vote, he\u2019ll need to win north of 22% of the white vote to emerge victorious given traditional turnout patterns. There\u2019s not much of a sign that will happen. After proportionally allocating undecideds, Espy is averaging only around 16% to 17% of the white vote in polling for the runoff over the last few months. Speaking of that polling, it\u2019s been limited but consistent. Hyde-Smith has averaged a low double-digit lead. Still, there just hasn\u2019t been that much polling. Only one public poll was taken and released in the final 21 days of the campaign. (More polls were taken before that.) Based on Senate elections since 1998, the true margin of error (i.e. 95% confidence interval) is +/- 13 points for any one poll in this final 21-day period. That means this race is technically within the margin of error. We\u2019re also talking about a special election the Tuesday after Thanksgiving. This is not the type of election most pollsters are used to polling, or the type of election for which there is a lot of historical precedent. The inability to model off past elections is why special Senate election polling has historically been less accurate than for other Senate elections. Indeed, Espy\u2019s best hope is for turnout patterns to change from the first round. There is precedent for this. The percentage of African-Americans as part of the electorate rose between the first round and runoff in the last two midterm Senate runoffs in next door Louisiana. We also saw a spike in black turnout in the Alabama special Senate election last year, which was also not held on Election Day. Because of Mississippi\u2019s highly polarized racial voting patterns, Hyde-Smith\u2019s margin shrinks more than a point for every extra percentage of the electorate black voters makeup. Of course, this is still Mississippi. Espy will need to win over a significantly larger percentage of white voters than he did in round one, even if turnout patterns change. I\u2019m unaware of any polling, public or private, to suggest that is likely.",

            "article_content": "Andrew Gillum, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida, conceded to his Republican opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, on Saturday, ending a protracted fight that saw the Tallahassee mayor take back his Election Day concession during a statewide recount. The concession ended Gillum\u2019s first bid for statewide office in Florida, but the run \u2013 despite his loss \u2013 vaulted the 39-year old politician into the upper echelons of Democratic politics. \u201cR. Jai and I wanted to take a moment to congratulate Mr. DeSantis on becoming the next governor of the great state of Florida,\u201d Gillum said in a Facebook video in which he appeared alongside his wife. \u201cThis has been the journey of our lives.\u201d DeSantis responded to Gillum\u2019s concession with a call for unity. \u201cThis was a hard-fought campaign,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to bring Florida together.\u201d The reality, however, is that the race between DeSantis and Gillum was anything but unifying. The contest was a heated affair that largely reflected the broader national tensions over race and class in the Trump era. Those issues, which were already bubbling up throughout the primary, were escalated by DeSantis when he went on Fox News a day after the primary to warn Florida voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum. DeSantis denied there was any racial innuendo in his remark, but race \u2013 and allegations that DeSantis was using it against his opponent \u2013 were never far off during the 10-week general election sprint. They hit a boiling point during the pair\u2019s second and final debate. DeSantis loudly objected to suggestions he was in cahoots with far-right figures or that his ties \u2013 unwitting, he said \u2013 to white supremacists should be held against him. \u201cNow, I\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist,\u201d Gillum said in response. \u201cI\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201d If that line earned Gillum viral praise and national recognition, his indirect connections to an FBI investigation into public corruption in Tallahassee was a drag on his campaign, which at times struggled to explain Gillum\u2019s relationship with a former lobbyist and friend and his run-ins with an undercover federal agent. Gillum maintained throughout the campaign that the FBI told him he was not a target of the probe, which could continue to dog him in the coming months or years. DeSantis has largely flown under the radar since Election Day. The conservative lawmaker began to put together a gubernatorial transition shortly after Election Day despite the ongoing recount. Gillum, after conceding the race on Election Night, took back his concession as late-counted ballots brought the race within just over 33,000 votes. \u201cI am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote,\u201d he said, after Florida election officials ordered a recount in three statewide contests. Gillum\u2019s race all but ended on Thursday, however, when the machine portion of the recount ended and DeSantis lost only one vote on the Tallahassee mayor. Because Gillum\u2019s race did not fall within the .25% standard that automatically triggers a manual recount, there was nowhere near the number of votes need for Gillum to close the gap. The state\u2019s Senate race, between Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican Gov. Rick Scott, and Florida\u2019s race for agriculture commissioner did fall within that margin and are currently in the midst of a hand recount. Gillum\u2019s fight during the recount, however, became bigger than just winning the race. He and other Democrats repeatedly said they were sticking with the campaign until all legally cast votes were counted. Lawyers for Democratic interests, including Nelson\u2019s campaign, looked to expand the number of available votes in federal court by overturning a series of Florida election laws, but those efforts largely failed. Gillum or his campaign were not party to any of those suits, but he could have stood to benefit from them. Gillum acknowledged this fight in his concession video. \u201cThis was not just about an election cycle, this was about creating the kind of change in this state that really allows for the voices of everyday people to show up against in our government,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cWe know that this fight continues.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sophie Tatum and Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.

            "article_content": "So much for the old rule that all politics is local. The results of last week\u2019s election demonstrated how powerfully national trends now shape election outcomes in every region. The election produced remarkably consistent divides along demographic and geographic lines in states as diverse as Arizona, Georgia and Texas on one side, and Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on the other. Though some important regional differences remained, voters who shared the same characteristics or resided in similar places largely voted the same way no matter what state they lived in. In virtually every state, Democrats last Tuesday displayed a clear advantage in densely populated, culturally and racially diverse white-collar metropolitan areas, while Republicans relied on elevated margins in the preponderantly white, religiously traditional, smaller places beyond them. In almost all cases, the outcome in each state was determined less by how much they varied from that persistent pattern than by how much of each group was present in the state\u2019s electorate to begin with. The continued nationalization of American politics threatens greater polarization and social tension as the lines harden between these two distinct political coalitions. But paradoxically, it means that the party that can generate the most exceptions to these solidifying trends may be the one most likely to control Congress and the White House. Whether measured by demography or geography, the 2018 election produced remarkably consistent patterns. Viewed by age, the results offered a vivid portrait of the price Republicans are paying among younger voters as Trump redefines the party in his confrontational image. The exit poll measuring preferences in House elections found that Democrats carried fully two thirds of voters aged 18-29. That was their best showing with them in exit polls since at least 1986 (narrowly exceeding their level even in former President Barack Obama\u2019s sweeping 2008 victory) and a big improvement on Hillary Clinton\u2019s 55% among them in 2016. And preliminary calculations indicate that youth turnout may have been half again as large in 2018 as it was in 2014, the most recent midterm. Even more striking was the consistency of the Democratic advantage around the nation. The Democratic candidate won voters aged 18-29 in all 21 Senate races with an exit poll except for Indiana, where Joe Donnelly tied Republican Mike Braun. (These figures do not include the exit poll in California, where two Democrats ran against each other after claiming the top spots in last June\u2019s state top-two primary.) Senate Democrats carried about three-fifths or more of these younger voters in Florida, Michigan, Minnesota (both for incumbent Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, who was elected in a special election), Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin. Democrats also reached at least 60% with them in governor\u2019s races in Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In the California governor\u2019s race, Democrat Gavin Newsom carried 69% of younger voters. Just as important, the Democratic advantage extended up the age ladder. Against Trump in 2016, Clinton carried only 51% of voters aged 30-44; while Trump won just 41% of them, a substantial 8% scattered to third-party candidates. This time, those voters consolidated behind Democrats. In the national House exit poll, Democrats won 58%. The margins weren\u2019t always as large in the Senate races with exit polls. But every Democratic Senate candidate carried the voters in this age group except for Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota. In states from Pennsylvania, Minnesota (both races) and Wisconsin to Florida and Nevada, Democrats carried about three-fifths of these voters. (The Arizona exit poll results combined voters aged 18-44: Democrat Kyrsten Sinema carried 59% of the combined group.) 2018 midterms update: What has changed since election night Republicans in turn consistently performed better with older voters \u2013 though with a surprising crack in their armor. In the national House exit poll, voters aged 45-64 split almost exactly evenly between the two parties. But Republicans won them, often convincingly, in most of the closely contested Senate races, including Florida, Indiana, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. That group of older workers, often described as the \u201canxious generation\u201d facing the final years before retirement, has emerged as a key Republican constituency. The results among seniors, though, were competitive. About four-fifths of today\u2019s seniors are white and they have moved right in recent elections: Trump won them in 2016, and Republicans have consistently carried them in recent congressional contests, exit polls have found. But this year they split about evenly in the national House exit poll (48% for Democrats versus 50% for Republicans) and in the state races they scattered more than most groups. Republicans won them convincingly in the contested Senate races in Florida, Tennessee, Indiana, Missouri, Texas and Nevada; but Democrats won them with solid margins in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, carried them narrowly in North Dakota and West Virginia and essentially split them in Montana and Wisconsin. (In the tight Arizona Senate race, Republican Martha McSally comfortably carried voters in the combined category of 45 and older.) The two Americas just lurched further apart Across the country, the results converged along educational lines too. In the national House exit poll, Republicans carried 61% of whites without a college education, Trump\u2019s best group. It\u2019s difficult to precisely compare that to previous years, because the exit polls changed the way they weight the results for education. What is clear from last week\u2019s results is the Republican advantage with these voters persisted in all regions: Klobuchar in Minnesota was the only Democratic Senate candidate to win most white voters without a college education, although Tester and Manchin came close. Both Joe Donnelly in Indiana and Claire McCaskill in Missouri, who had shown appeal to these voters earlier in their careers, each carried only about on -third of them while losing their Senate seats to Republican challengers. In southern states, where many non-college whites are also evangelical Christians, the numbers were even more lopsided: Ron DeSantis carried almost two thirds of them against African-American Democrat Andrew Gillum in the Florida governor\u2019s race; Ted Cruz carried nearly three fourths of them in his Texas Senate race against Beto O\u2019Rourke; and Brian Kemp won over four fifths of them against African-American Democrat Stacey Abrams in their Georgia governor\u2019s contest. Democrats, by contrast, carried 53% of whites with a college education in the national House exit polls. Again, it\u2019s difficult to precisely compare that with earlier results because of the changes in the poll\u2019s methodology. But on Tuesday Democrats won these voters in 13 Senate races and tied in another (North Dakota). Democrats won about three fifths or more of college-educated white women in Senate races from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Missouri, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, to Nevada, Florida and Montana. White-collar whites also helped Democrats win governorships in Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Nevada. The persistence of these demographic trends through all corners of the country largely explains the lopsided geography in results for the House of Representatives. Republicans suffered very few dents in their dominance of small town and rural House seats last week. Democrats won only three districts whose rural population ranks in the top 20% of the House, while losing two of their own in those ranks, according to tabulations by CNN producer Aaron Kessler. But the palpable recoil from Trump among white-collar voters in all regions explains why the GOP losses in suburban House seats extended so widely. It was perhaps not a surprise that Democrats ousted many of the last House Republicans who had survived for years in suburbs of otherwise blue-trending metro areas, such as Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle. But the breadth of the movement toward Democrats among well-educated white voters explains why the GOP also lost suburban House seats last week in Atlanta, Charleston, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City, Des Moines, Oklahoma City, Orange County (CA), and possibly Salt Lake City, all places that had earlier resisted the white collar Democratic tide. Of the 33 Republican-held seats that CNN has called for the Democrats, 26 (or nearly four-fifths) are in districts where the share of college graduates exceeds the national average, according to Kessler\u2019s calculations. It is impossible to ignore the defection of women voters away from the GOP The result is a politics that is converging across different regions. Political analysts, with justification, are accustomed to thinking of Pennsylvania as a quintessential swing state and Texas as the foundation of the Republican coalition. But the results in both places on Tuesday shared many similarities. In both states, Republicans continued to run very well in small towns and rural places (though Democrat Bob Casey in Pennsylvania regained ground in such mid-sized blue-collar communities as Erie and Scranton). And just like Casey, Beto O\u2019Rourke ran up the score in diverse and younger urban places (he won each of the counties including Austin, Dallas and Houston by 200,000 votes or more and amassed a 100,000-plus margin in San Antonio), and made marked gains in previously red-leaning suburban areas around those metropolitan centers, from Collin and Denton counties near Dallas to Williamson and Hayes outside of Austin. Until now, Republicans had dominated both the urban and rural parts of Texas since the mid-1990s. In terms of its political alignment \u2013 a suddenly competitive contest between growing Democratic strength in metro areas and undiminished Republican dominance beyond them \u2013 2018 may be the year that Texas rejoined the union. Yet for all the consistency of these geographic and demographic trends, the results in the 2020 presidential race may be shaped most by each party\u2019s ability to defy them  \u2013 or at least to bend them at the margins. In the Rust Belt states that tipped the 2016 election to Trump \u2013 especially Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania \u2013 Democrats won both Senate and governor\u2019s races last week by restoring an old advantage that Trump had largely erased: In all three states, the Democratic nominees ran slightly better among whites without a college degree than their party did almost anywhere else. They\u2019ll need to continue that revival to recapture the states in two years from Trump, who may present a more formidable challenge in them than the Republicans on last week\u2019s ballot. Conversely, despite the Democratic gains in Southern suburbs, Republicans continued to run better among college-educated white voters in Florida, Texas and Georgia than they did in most places. (Although exit polls weren\u2019t available in North Carolina, the voting results there point to a similar conclusion.) To hold those states in 2020, Trump will need to prevent any further erosion, even as white-collar voters elsewhere appear to be hardening in their hostility to him. Even in a politics increasingly homogenized by the same national trends, these small regional variations could provide the tipping point for the epic confrontation approaching in 2020.",

Hyde-Smith faces former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy in a runoff election on November 27 for the Mississippi Senate seat. The runoff election was triggered when neither she nor Espy received more than 50% of the vote total on November 6. Hyde-Smith was appointed in April to fill the seat vacated by longtime Republican Sen. Thad Cochran, who stepped down due to health reasons. She became the first female senator to represent the state. Espy said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Monday morning that the comments were \u201cdisappointing\u201d and reflected poorly on the state. \u201cThey are hurtful to millions of\u00a0Mississippians who are people of\u00a0goodwill,\u201d Espy said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re harmful\u00a0because they tend to reinforce\u00a0the stereotypes that have held back\u00a0our state for so long and that\u00a0have cost us jobs and harmed our\u00a0economy.\u201d In the video, Hyde-Smith appeared to be speaking during a campaign event about the support of a Mississippi rancher. The line drew applause and laughter from the crowd. The short video clip was met with immediate backlash online and had more than 2 million page views as of late Sunday night. Hyde-Smith issued a statement on Sunday after the video posted, saying, \u201cIn a comment on Nov. 2, I referred to accepting an invitation to a speaking engagement. In referencing the one who invited me, I used an exaggerated expression of regard, and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\u201d \"If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row\"- Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith says in Tupelo, MS after Colin Hutchinson, cattle rancher, praises her. Hyde-Smith is in a runoff on Nov 27th against Mike Espy. pic.twitter.com/0a9jOEjokr In a statement posted to Twitter on Sunday, Espy, who would become the first black senator to represent Mississippi since the Reconstruction era if he wins, called the comments \u201creprehensible.\u201d He wrote, \u201cThey have no place in our political discourse, in Mississippi, or our country. We need leaders, not dividers, and her words show that she lacks the understanding and judgment to represent the people of our state.\u201d In his CNN interview Monday morning, he said Hyde-Smith\u2019s response was \u201ctone deaf,\u201d but when asked if the remark itself was racist or had racial connotations, Espy demurred and instead presented himself as a unifying candidate. \u201cMy campaign is the campaign that tries to reach across the racial chasm, reach across the party chasm and bring us together,\u201d Espy said. Mississippi had the highest number of lynchings in the nation between 1882 and 1968, according to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. \u201cHyde-Smith\u2019s decision to joke about \u2018hanging\u2019 when the history of African Americans is marred by countless incidents of this barbarous act, is sick,\u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson said in a statement Sunday, according to The Washington Post. \u201cAny politician seeking to serve as a national voice of the people of Mississippi should know better.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eli Watkins contributed to this report.",

Lee also noted that the group had put no Asian American students on the stand over the past three weeks to voice their grievances and back up the group\u2019s bias claims.

Ultimately at stake is a 1978 Supreme Court ruling that first allowed universities to consider race as one of many factors in admissions but forbade quotas. The case could change who gets into Harvard and highly competitive universities across the country. Students for Fair Admissions, which filed the case in November 2014, asserts that Harvard intentionally discriminates against Asian-Americans as it engages in unlawful racial balancing that awards preferences to blacks and Latinos. Harvard denies the claim, defends the fairness of a process that considers a range of student characteristics, and contends that if it was forced to abide by racially neutral criteria, the number of black and Hispanic students on campus would plummet. A ruling in this initial district court phase is still months away. US District Court Judge Allison Burroughs said she would hold a post-trial briefing with the parties early in 2019 to address any remaining issues, before eventually ruling. Students for Fair Admissions, founded by conservative advocate Edward Blum, has sued Harvard under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which bars intentional race discrimination at colleges and universities that receive federal funds. Blum, based in Maine, has brought a series of lawsuits against racial policies up to the Supreme Court. Abigail Fisher, a white student who sued the University of Texas at Austin over affirmative action, lost her long-running case in 2016. The Texas program was upheld by a single vote, that of Anthony Kennedy, who resigned this summer and was succeeded by the more conservative Brett Kavanaugh. Three years earlier, however, Blum achieved a major victory in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, as the Supreme Court curtailed the reach of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Blum, a former stockbroker who is not a lawyer, recruited the Alabama county that successfully challenged a VRA provision that had required states with a history of discrimination to clear any proposed changes in election rules with the US Department of Justice before enactment. Harvard receives about 40,000 annual applications and ends up with a final freshman class of about 1,600. The percentage of Asian American students has been rising through the years and the most recently admitted class of 2022 is 23% Asian American. African Americans constitute about 15% and Latinos, 12 percent. A category of mainly white students account for 50% Students for Fair Admissions has argued that those percentages have been relatively constant because of \u201cracial balancing,\u201d and that Asian American applicants are essentially capped below the acceptance percentage they merit. The group says Harvard tamps down successful Asian American applicants mainly through manipulation of crucial \u201cpersonal\u201d rankings, which assess a range of traits from leadership to likeability and which can be determinative among so many high-achieving applicants. (In the group that became the current Class of 2019, for example, 8,000 of the US applicants had perfect GPAs, and more than 5,000 had a perfect math or verbal SAT score.) In his final arguments Friday, Hughes argued that Harvard uses the important \u201cpersonal\u201d rating to deflate Asian American admission chances, while it inflates the chances for blacks and Hispanics. He displayed a chart showing racial categories of students who had earned the highest academic scores. The top Asian Americans consistently received the lowest \u201cpersonal\u201d ratings, while the top African American applicants were awarded the highest \u201cpersonal\u201d ratings. Harvard rejected the evidence, saying it rested on a false assumption that academic superiority aligns with a personal character assessment. The \u201cpersonal rating,\u201d insisted Seth Waxman, a lawyer for Harvard who shared the closing arguments, \u201chas almost no correlation\u201d to the academic index. More broadly, Waxman faulted the challengers\u2019 data models, which showed Asian American applicants at a disadvantage among other racial groups, because they excluded these \u201cpersonal\u201d ratings, as well as a whole class of traditionally favored applicants: athletes, children of alumni, faculty and staff or on a special dean\u2019s list. The challengers also removed from their data analyses a student\u2019s parents\u2019 occupation and the student\u2019s intended career \u2013 both of which Harvard said mattered in trying to bring in a range of backgrounds and experiences. Lawyer Adam Mortara, who closed out the session on behalf of Students for Fair Admissions, rebuffed Harvard\u2019s efforts to discount the group. He said it had 20,000 members and was determined to try to end admissions practices that arise from racial stereotyping. \u201cSome day this [case] will be written about in the history books, and those books will say there was Asian American discrimination at Harvard. Of that, I am confident. Those books might say that Harvard let the wolf of racial bias in through the front door,\u201d Mortara said. \u201cI hope those books will say this court slammed the door shut.\u201d In Burroughs\u2019 own brief remarks as the trial ended Friday afternoon, she said she felt the weight of the case, for students and universities nationwide. Appointed to the bench in late 2014 by President Barack Obama, Burroughs began presiding over the dispute soon after it was filed. Throughout the trial, she asked relatively few questions, mainly testing the presumptions behind the data analyses. On Monday, she heard from eight Harvard students and alumni who spoke about their experiences as racial and ethnic minorities at the Cambridge campus. From Native American, Vietnamese and other diverse backgrounds, they recounted feeling marginalized and stereotyped in their youth and that they came to feel appreciated for their differences at Harvard. Presented by civil rights organizations that had entered the case as amici, \u201cfriends of the court,\u201d that testimony brought a human dimension to a trial filled with data crunching and contrasting views of what factors most illuminated Harvard\u2019s screening practices. \u201cNo criticism intended,\u201d Burroughs said at one point to Harvard\u2019s leading data witness as he was criticizing the challengers\u2019 interpretation, \u201cbut I assume that you\u2019re both presenting the data in the way that\u2019s most efficacious for your models.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Opportunity and necessity alike are pushing Democrats to focus more intently on gaining ground across the Sun Belt in next week\u2019s election, from Florida and Georgia in the Southeast to Nevada and Arizona in the Southwest. The opportunity comes from changing demographics: with their young, diverse populations and in most cases, growing ranks of white-collar, information-age workers clustered into busting metropolitan areas, the Sun Belt states increasingly embody the modern Democratic electoral coalition. The necessity is driven by the prospects of losses for Democrats not only next week, but in years ahead in states across the nation\u2019s interior. In an era when older, blue-collar, rural and culturally conservative white voters are moving more toward the Republican Party under Donald Trump, Democrats are facing increasing challenges in Heartland and Rust Belt states dominated by exactly those kinds of voters. That long-term challenge is evident this year in the difficulty Democrats are facing holding Senate seats in North Dakota, Missouri, Indiana, and to a slightly lesser extent, Montana and West Virginia. To offset what could be future Republican gains in the Heartland at every level \u2013 the House, the Senate and the Electoral College \u2013 Democrats in the coming years will need greater inroads in states across the Sun Belt. These include Florida, North Carolina and Georgia in the Southeast, as well as Arizona, Nevada and eventually Texas in the Southwest. (Two other Southwestern states, Colorado and New Mexico, after performing as swing states earlier this century, now lean more reliably toward the Democrats. Virginia in the Southeast, has followed the same trajectory.) Despite favorable demography, Democrats have established only a very limited beachhead in these six key Sun Belt battlegrounds. In many of these states, the Democratic Party has been virtually moribund: it hasn\u2019t won a statewide office in Texas since 1994 or in Arizona since 2008. In Arizona, Bill Clinton in 1996 is the only Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state since 1948. In 2016, Trump carried all of these states except Nevada. The only governorship among them that Democrats now hold is in North Carolina, and they control just two of their dozen Senate seats (Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada and Bill Nelson, who\u2019s locked in a tight battle for reelection with outgoing Gov. Rick Scott in Florida.) Democrats haven\u2019t elected a US Senator in Arizona for 30 years. But this year, Democrats are pulsing with vastly more energy across the Sun Belt states, though they still face big structural barriers in all of them. In the Southeast, the emergence of the party\u2019s first African-American gubernatorial nominees in Georgia (Stacey Abrams) and Florida (Andrew Gillum) has electrified local activists. Both are locked in tight races, with Gillum given slightly better odds. Democrats also have a strong chance to win the governorship in Nevada, though their candidates trail badly in Arizona and Texas. (Democrats are also favored to win the governorships in Colorado and New Mexico, the two Southwestern states that already lean more toward them.) The best two Democratic opportunities to pick up a Republican-held Senate seat are in the Southwest: Nevada, where Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen is challenging Dean Heller, and Arizona, where Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is battling Republican Rep. Martha McSally. CNN polls released Wednesday showed both Democrats holding a narrow advantage. In Texas, Democrat Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke has galvanized Democrats nationwide, and raised unprecedented sums of money, while launching a vigorous challenge to Sen. Ted Cruz. O\u2019Rourke still faces a tough climb to beat Cruz, but many Democrats believe his dynamic grassroots campaigning has provided the party a pathway toward restoring its competitiveness in the state. All of these states are politically defined by a stark racial divergence between their diverse youth populations and predominantly white seniors \u2013 what I\u2019ve called the brown and the gray. Brookings Institution demographer Bill Frey has projected that by 2020, minorities will constitute a clear majority of the under-30 population in Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, and Texas, and more than two-fifths of that population in North Carolina. At the same time, the population aged 65 to 69 in each of these states (save for Texas) will remain roughly two-thirds white by then. And even in Texas, whites will represent about three-fifths. The political challenge this creates for Democrats is starkly apparent in Arizona. Especially in mid-term elections like this year, young people and minorities here vote at vastly lower rates than older and white people. While over 46% of eligible Arizona whites turned out in 2014, only one-third of African-Americans and slightly less than one-third of Hispanics did so, according to Census Bureau figures. The generational contrast was even more dramatic: While more than three-in-five eligible voters 65 and older voted in Arizona in 2014, according to the Census Bureau, less than one-in-five of those younger than 35 did so, an anemic figure. Chuck Coughlin, a Phoenix-based Republican consultant says it\u2019s likely that voters older than 50 will comprise at least 55% of the electorate next week. \u201cWe keep talking about a younger group \u2013 and it will happen \u2013 but as most things happen in politics, it\u2019s incremental,\u201d he says. Latino groups in Arizona are mounting a major effort to accelerate that change. Eduardo Sainz, the Arizona director for Mi Familia Vota, says a coalition of Latino groups have registered 200,000 new voters in the state this year. But increasing their turnout remains a grudging process. While Trump has stirred anger among Latinos, Sainz says, it isn\u2019t always easy to convince irregular voters that they can express their distaste for him by voting for Democrats in Congressional elections this year. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s hard to make sure the community members are participating when [we\u2019re] not having Donald Trump on the ballot,\u201d he says. It doesn\u2019t help, he notes, that campaigns have usually focused their own spending on groups considered more likely to show up. Still, Sainz is confident that the sheer growth in the Latino population will steadily translate into more influence, even if turnout increases only slowly. \u201cThis is going to be the last election that politicians can take us for granted,\u201d he says. \u201cI believe that in the future politicians are not going to have a choice to take us for granted because the demographics in Arizona for Latinos are growing tremendously.\u201d And Democrats can find reason for optimism in early voting returns that show youth turnout enormously increasing across the Sun Belt states compared to 2014. On the other hand, that growth is measured against a very low base in 2014 turnout, which has caused some experts to question whether or how much young people will increase their actual share of the vote relative to older voters, who are also casting ballots in large numbers so far. In any case, increasing turnout among non-white voters, especially younger ones, is only half of the equation for Democrats in all of the Sun Belt states they are hoping to flip. The other is replicating the gains that Democrats in other regions have made with college-educated whites, especially women. In many states along the coasts, Democrats now win about half or more of those college-educated white voters. But those voters are generally more conservative across the Sun Belt: in 2016, Hillary Clinton won less than one-third of college educated whites in Georgia and Texas, only slightly more than one-third in Florida, just under two-fifths in North Carolina and slightly more than two-fifths in Nevada and Arizona. Only in the latter two states did she approach her national share of 45%, according to exit polls. This year, unease with Trump among these voters, especially women, have positioned Democrats for gains with them. Abrams and O\u2019Rourke face the toughest roads: though each have notched gains compared to earlier Democrats, most polls show him stuck below 40% with them, and Abrams generally even lower (though she is campaigning heavily in the Atlanta suburbs). But several surveys have shown Gillum in Florida running even or leading among college-educated whites. And the CNN polls this week showed both Rosen and Sinema holding narrow leads among those voters and winning about half of them. Sue Gerard, a former GOP state legislator in Arizona, is one of the college-educated white voters tilting away from the party in the Trump era. Gerard counts conservative icon Barry Goldwater as one of her heroes. Now she\u2019s heading a Republicans for Sinema group. \u201cIt\u2019s not as big a step now because so many of my friends and colleagues that were Republicans are no longer Republicans because of what\u2019s been happening in the party,\u201d Gerard says. \u201cMy attitude is I haven\u2019t moved in my beliefs, the party has moved, so I\u2019m thinking there will still be a day when moderate Republicans will not be a dirty word or an endangered species.\u201d In all of the Sun Belt states, public polls show Republicans in the key races holding crushing leads among Trump\u2019s best constituency: white voters without a college degree. To overcome that, Democrats will need to both turn out more minority and young voters than they have in the past, and run better among college-educated whites in the region. On both fronts, says Coughlin, the GOP consultant, Democrats are likely to post at least some improvement. \u201cI think they will,\u201d he says. \u201cIs it enough to flip? Is it enough to turn it?\u201d The answer to that question in Arizona and other Sun Belt states will likely grow increasingly pressing for Democrats in years ahead as the demographic and geographic resorting of American politics proceeds. Given the GOP\u2019s strength among older and blue-collar whites \u2013 Trump in 2016 carried three-fifths of whites older than 45 and two-thirds of whites of all ages without a college degree \u2013 Democrats are likely to face growing pressure across older, whiter, heavily Christian interior states. They received a preview of that challenge in 2016 when Trump swept Michigan, Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, while coming close to swiping Minnesota. This year, Democrats have stabilized their position in all six of those states. Democratic Senate incumbents are seeking reelection in each of them except Iowa and all of them are solid favorites to win next week. Democrats are also favored to win the governorships in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Minnesota and are locked in toss up races in the other three states. Yet even with that recovery in the industrial Midwest, next week could dramatize the long-term threat to Democrats across these older interior states. The party is still at high risk of losing Senate seats in five other Heartland states. The greatest danger confronts Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota and Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Joe Donnelly in Indiana leads in the latest public polls but trailed in surveys earlier in October. Though the polls send somewhat conflicting signals, Joe Manchin in West Virginia and Jon Tester in Montana appear better positioned to survive. Arizona and Nevada offer Democrats their best opportunity this year to counter those possible Senate losses in the Heartland. Gains across the Sun Belt could be even more important for the party\u2019s presidential ticket in 2020 when all signs suggest Trump will remain a formidable competitor for the big Rust Belt battlegrounds generally tilting back toward the Democrats this year. This year\u2019s big marquee races across the Sun Belt-the governor\u2019s contests in Florida and Georgia along with the Senate races in Nevada, Arizona and Texas \u2013 will offer important clues about whether these states are moving toward the Democrats, or remain leaning toward the GOP, as attention turns from the midterm toward the epic presidential showdown of 2020.",

            "article_content": "House forecast: Democrats will win 226 seats (and the House majority) while Republicans will win just 209 seats. A Democratic win of 203 seats and 262 seats is within the margin of error. Senate forecast: Republicans will hold 52 seats (and maintain control of the Senate) next Congress while Democrats will hold just 48. Anything between Republicans holding 49 seats and 56 seats is within the margin of error. For those of you hoping the 2018 midterms will end on Election Day, I have some bad news: It\u2019s possible that we go into overtime. I\u2019m not just talking recounts. I\u2019m talking about runoff elections in Georgia and Mississippi. Let\u2019s look at Georgia first. Georgia state law requires that a candidate receives a majority of the vote in order to win. Right now, it\u2019s not clear that either Democrat Stacey Abrams or Republican Brian Kemp will reach the magical 50%+ on November 6. That\u2019s because Libertarian Ted Metz is also running. When one averages all the polls taken in October and allocate the undecideds between Abrams and Kemp, Kemp leads with 49.3% to Abrams 48.3% to Metz\u2019s 2.3%. In other words, if the polls were right on (and they probably won\u2019t be), Kemp and Abrams would face each other in a runoff on December 4. It would be tempting to assume that Kemp would be a favorite for that runoff. Not only would he have earned the most votes in the general election, he\u2019d be likely to pick up more of Metz\u2019s votes than Abrams would. Additionally, runoffs in Georgia have not been kind to Democrats over the last 26 years. Back in 1992, Democratic Sen. Wyche Fowler won a plurality (not a majority) in the general election. He lost the runoff to Republican Paul Coverdell with turnout a little more than half what it had been in the general election. In the 2008 Senate race, it was basically the same story. Republican Saxby Chambliss got three points more of the vote than Democrat Jim Martin in the general election but fell short of 50%. Chambliss, however, would beat Martin by 15 points in the runoff. Like in 1992, turnout was significantly lower in the runoff than it had been in the general election. Low turnout on its own didn\u2019t hurt the Democrats in those races. It was the fact black voters didn\u2019t turn out in as high numbers relative to white voters in either runoff. Although Georgia\u2019s vote isn\u2019t divided along racial lines as much as it is in Mississippi, Democrats need high black turnout in order to win in Georgia. The question, therefore, is whether black voters will turn out for a runoff election in 2018. It\u2019s not clear whether 1992 or 2008 are a good guide for what might happen. Both 1992 and 2008 were presidential years, which usually feature significantly higher turnout than a midterm election. This is a midterm election where turnout is going to be lower. It\u2019s taking place in a year when we\u2019ve already seen high Democratic turnout in special elections off cycle. Perhaps as importantly, 2008 featured the first black presidential major party nominee in Barack Obama, who was not on the ballot in the runoff. This year is something different all together. Abrams, who is aiming to become the first black woman governor, will be on the ballot in both the general election and the runoff. It\u2019s not difficult to imagine that black voters would come out to vote in the runoff in a way they might not otherwise if the Democratic candidate were white. Indeed, Louisiana\u2019s recent runoffs tell a very different story than Georgia\u2019s. Looking to Louisiana isn\u2019t a perfect guide, but it gives us some guidance on midterms. Unlike Georgia, Louisiana, another southern state with racially polarized voting patterns, has recently held major statewide runoffs in midterm cycles. Both the 2002 and 2014 Senate races required runoffs. Instead of seeing the black percentage of the electorate fall in the runoff relative to the November election, it actually rose in both 2002 and 2014. In 2002, it went from 25.9% to 27.1%. In 2014, it climbed from 28.8% to 30.3%. These 1-point to 2 point differences may not seem like they matter. They could. Because of the state\u2019s racial voting patterns, increasing the black percentage of the electorate by even a point could swing a 1 point Kemp lead in the general election to a 1 point Abrams win in the runoff. The power of the black vote in southern politics shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. In 2014, the top vote getter in the Mississippi Republican Senate race changed between the primary and primary runoff. Why? It was thanks to an unusual and seemingly successful attempt by Thad Cochran\u2019s campaign to get black voters who hadn\u2019t voted in the primary to vote in the runoff. Speaking of Mississippi, it seems likely at this point that there will be runoff in the state\u2019s special Senate election. This Tuesday\u2019s election will act as a primary in which all the candidates, regardless of party affiliation, will run against each other. The major vote getters in the primary look to be Democrat Mike Espy, Republican Chris McDaniel and Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith. The polling isn\u2019t entirely clear, but it seems plausible that Espy will finish first because the Republican candidates will split the Republican vote. The bad news for Espy is that none of the polls have him close to a majority on Tuesday. In fact, no poll has any of the candidates close to 50% at this time. They all, however, have Espy and Hyde-Smith finishing either first or second with McDaniel in third. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff in late November will be held between the top two vote getters. Hyde-Smith would be a heavy favorite in a runoff against Espy. Our forecast has her favored by 15 points. Were McDaniel to make the runoff with Espy, polls indicate that Espy would have a real chance of winning. That match up seems unlikely at this point. One final and exhausting scenario is that after Election Day, Democrats control 50 Senate seats, Republicans control 49 Senate seats and Mississippi requires a runoff. If Espy and McDaniel make that runoff, we might not know who controls the Senate until late November. If it\u2019s Espy and Hyde-Smith, we won\u2019t be able to call Senate control next week, but the answer to the question of who will control will be more of mere formality than anything else.",

They felt compelled to endorse someone. 2. Both Menendez and Republican Senate nominee Bob Hugin are truly awful. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! In an op-ed headlined \u201cChoke it down, and vote for Menendez\u201d (I told you it was bad!), the editorial board writes: \u201cThis year\u2019s U.S. Senate race presents the most depressing choice for New Jersey voters in a generation, with two awful candidates whose most convincing argument is that the other guy is unfit to serve.\u201d Democracy! Love it! For the uninitiated, Menendez is running for a third term amid the lingering whiff of corruption. In April 2015, he was charged with 14 criminal counts \u2013 8 of which dealt with bribery \u2013 revolving around his relationship with a wealthy doctor named Salomon Melgen. In November 2017, the jury deadlocked on the charges and a mistrial was declared. The Justice Department declined the opportunity to pursue a retrial. But in April 2018, the Senate Ethics Committee \u2013 including its three Democratic members \u2013 released a \u201cpublic letter of admonition\u201d that read in part: \u201cThe Committee has found that over a six-year period you knowingly and repeatedly accepted gifts of significant value from Dr. Melgen without obtaining required Committee approval, and that you failed to publicly disclose certain gifts as required by Senate rule and federal law. \u2026 The Committee has determined that this conduct violated Senate Rules, federal law, and applicable standards of conduct.\u201d Here\u2019s what the Star-Ledger op-ed had to say about Menendez\u2019s ethical issues: \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that Menendez escaped criminal conviction, and an act of profound narcissism that he stayed in the race despite this baggage, putting a Democratic seat at risk while Donald Trump sits in the White House.\u201d Amazing! You\u2019d think Hugin, a wealthy businessman and former chairman of Donald Trump\u2019s New Jersey campaign, would clear that incredibly low bar, right? WRONG! The Star-Ledger op-ed details a series of complaints against Hugin during his time at Celgene, a pharmaceutical firm, including a settlement of more than $280 million in a whistleblower lawsuit \u2013 not to mention the company\u2019s aggressive work to limit the development of generic alternatives to its cancer drugs. But the editorial board saved its most vicious bile for Hugin\u2019s decision to run TV ads alleging that Menendez frequented child prostitutes in the Dominican Republic, a claim based on a single anonymous source in the Menendez indictment.   \u201cWhich candidate is worse when it comes to personal ethics,\u201d writes the editorial board. \u201cAsk a philosopher, because to us it seems neither man can claim much advantage.\u201d So why then choose a candidate at all? And why Menendez? On the first front, the op-ed explains that voting is too important a right to give up. \u201cBeing a patriotic American is not just about fighting enemies abroad or helping flood victims at home,\u201d they write. \u201cIt\u2019s about making our democracy work, even when pulling the lever brings no joy.\u201d On why Menendez, the answer is simple: Donald Trump. \u201cThe question is which candidate can best fight Trump\u2019s toxic policies, his grotesque appeals to racial and ethnic tribalism, and his corrosive attacks on the pillars of our democracy, starting with the rule of law,\u201d reads the piece, concluding that Menendez is clearly the better choice to fight Trump\u2019s policies. Which, congratulations \u2013 or something. But trust me: You\u2019re not going to be seeing this \u201cendorsement\u201d in any ads for Menendez in the closing week of the Senate race.",

            "article_content": "A top campaign consultant to Corey Stewart, the Republican nominee for US Senate in Virginia, once wrote in a Facebook post that black Americans should \u201cstop whining about \u2018racism.\u2019\u201d Rick Shaftan, the Stewart media and polling adviser who made the comment, has in the past disparaged prominent Civil Rights figures like John Lewis and Rosa Parks, described majority-black cities as \u201csh**holes\u201d and told his followers not to open businesses in black neighborhoods, The Daily Beast reported \u201cMessage to black people, stop whining about \u2018racism.\u2019 Everyone else, including other \u2018minorities\u2019 are getting sick of hearing about it and no longer care that your feelings are hurt,\u201d Shaftan wrote in a July 2016 Facebook post. \u201cIt\u2019s not 1964 any more. You\u2019ve lost public sympathy. The only people you have left are old guilty whites and they\u2019re dying off.\u201d \u201cMy conservative black friends understand this, but they are all in the 0.1% of blacks that didn\u2019t vote for Obama,\u201d he added. Shaftan\u2019s consulting firm, Atlantic Media & Research, has been paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by Stewart\u2019s campaign during Stewart\u2019s 2017 run for governor and current bid for US Senate, according to election records. Last month, Stewart cut ties with spokesman and consultant Noel Fritsch, who, as CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported, spread conspiracies and made anti-Muslim comments. In his latest FEC filing this month, Stewart paid Shaftan\u2019s firm an additional $16,409 dollars. Stewart is running against Democratic incumbent Tim Kaine. The most recent polling of the race, conducted September 4-9 by the University of Mary Washington and SSRS, showed Kaine leading 52% to 36% among likely voters. CNN rates the race as a Solid Democrat. A spokesperson for Stewart\u2019s campaign declined to comment for this story. Stewart is not the only candidate who has paid Shaftan\u2019s company for work this year. FEC records, first noted by the liberal watchdog group Media Matters, show that Republican congressional candidates Wendy Rogers in Arizona and Seth Grossman in New Jersey both paid Shaftan\u2019s firm for work. The National Republican Congressional Committee pulled support for Grossman earlier this year. CNN\u2019s KFile team reported that Grossman, who railed against diversity, had a history of anti-Muslim comments. Rogers is running against incumbent Democratic Rep. Tom O\u2019Halleran in an Arizona district that he last carried by seven percentage points, and Hillary Clinton won by a narrow margin in 2016. Shaftan, according to two other posts on his Facebook account, believes that most African-Americans are racist against whites. \u201cThe reason race relations are in the sad state they are today is not hatred of blacks by whites but hatred of \u2018whites\u2019 (defined as anyone not black) by African-Americans,\u201d Shaftan wrote in July 2015. \u201cNormal Black people in this country need to speak out against the vile anti-\u2018white\u2019 racist views of the overwhelming majority of African-Americans in this country. These racists have self-segregated and hate those who do not look like them,\u201d he stated in December 2014. Even after Shaftan\u2019s past comments were reported by CNN, the Daily Beast and others, the consultant to Stewart has continued to comment on racial issues. On September 19, 2018, Shaftan linked to an article about a New Jersey schools superintendent wanting a public apology from another school district for a player on their football team using the N-word in social media post about the opposing team\u2019s players. \u201c#WhyTrumpWon,\u201d Shaftan wrote.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump launched what opponents decried as a racially loaded attack Monday on Florida Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum, labeling him a \u201cthief\u201d without evidence and claiming that, as mayor of Tallahassee, Gillum oversees one of the country\u2019s \u201cmost corrupt cities.\u201d The President\u2019s tweet comes just eight days before the election to decide who will lead the state: Gillum or his Republican rival, former Rep. Ron DeSantis. Early voting is already underway and Gillum, who is vying to become the state\u2019s first African-American governor, led by double digits in a recent CNN poll. In Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country! Gillum responded less than an hour after Trump\u2019s attack and, like the last time they clashed, mocked the President for not engaging him more directly. \u201cOn Twitter there is a choice between having the courage to @ the person you are trash talking, or not,\u201d Gillum wrote. \u201c@realDonaldTrump is howling because he\u2019s weak. Florida, go vote today.\u201d His opponent, DeSantis, has keyed in on Gillum\u2019s 2016 decision to accept a ticket to see the Broadway show \u201cHamilton\u201d from a group that included an undercover FBI agent, according to text and email records released under subpoena last week, as evidence that an ongoing federal corruption probe in Tallahassee is closer to the mayor than has been reported. DeSantis has also questioned whether a trip Gillum took that year to Costa Rica with his wife, along with lobbyist and longtime friend Adam Corey and his associates, was appropriate. Gillum has said he paid his own way. No one connected to Gillum or the investigation has been charged with a crime, and Gillum has repeatedly said the FBI has told him he is not a focus of the probe. There has been no suggestion of outright thievery, as suggested by Trump, even by Gillum\u2019s political opponents. The probe centers on whether developers successfully influenced city projects, although at one point an undercover agent infiltrated Gillum\u2019s inner circle and attended the trip to New York with Corey, Gillum and Gillum\u2019s brother. Despite Gillum\u2019s assertions that he is not a target of the federal probe, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders claimed Gillum was under investigation by the FBI when asked at a news conference on Monday what the President meant when he used the word \u201cthief\u201d to describe the candidate. \u201cThat individual\u2019s under FBI investigation. I would refer you to that,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into specifics on that matter because it involves two candidates running for office and I\u2019m not going to impact that due to the Hatch Act. I\u2019ll leave that to the President to make those kinds of statements.\u201d Gillum\u2019s campaign dismissed Sanders\u2019 assertions as \u201cdesperate falsehoods\u201d in a statement Monday. \u201cThese desperate falsehoods make it clear the Trump Administration is more concerned with saving the failed gubernatorial campaign of its loyal lapdog Ron DeSantis, than it is with the truth,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt\u2019s simply wrong to say Mayor Gillum is under FBI investigation\u2014he\u2019s not under FBI investigation and the FBI has confirmed it. Conspiracy theories aren\u2019t true just because President Trump and Ron DeSantis pretend they are.\u201d The President\u2019s comment earlier Monday sparked an instant backlash from an array of Democrats, including the group led by billionaire donor Tom Steyer, one of Gillum\u2019s top supporters, which described the language as \u201canother racist dog-whistle meant to stir up his base because he knows DeSantis is behind.\u201d DeSantis began the general election campaign by warning voters not to \u201cmonkey this up\u201d by electing Gillum, a remark he subsequently denied had any racial component. DeSantis has also faced questions over his role as an administrator on a racist Facebook page, which a spokesman for him said the former lawmaker had been added to unwittingly and had since left. Questioned last week at their second debate over his decision to speak at conferences hosted by David Horowitz, an anti-Muslim conservative political activist, DeSantis angrily rejected any suggestion he shared those views. The exchange teed up Gillum, who shot back, \u201cMy grandmother used to say, \u2018A hit dog will holler,\u2019 and it hollered through this room,\u201d adding that while he wasn\u2019t calling DeSantis a racist, \u201cI\u2019m simply saying the racists believe he\u2019s a racist.\u201d The records relating to Gillum\u2019s theater excursion in New York, which were subpoenaed by the state ethics commissions two weeks ago, according to the Tampa Bay Times, cast doubt on the explanation from Gillum\u2019s campaign that the mayor received the ticket from his brother, Marcus. At a debate last week, Gillum took responsibility for not asking \u201cmore questions\u201d about the situation at the time. \u201cI was aware that Adam Corey and (an agent known as) Mike Miller arranged so that we could go and see the show. I arrived at the theater and received my ticket from my brother,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cThe problem that I have is that I should have asked more questions to make sure that everything that had transpired was aboveboard.\u201d Gillum had also addressed the controversy earlier last week at a CNN debate with DeSantis. DeSantis and Gillum spar over race, Trump in contentious Florida governor debate \u201cDid you pay for the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ticket, or did the undercover FBI agent pay for the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ticket?\u201d DeSantis had asked. Gillum never directly answered, but said he had \u2013 in general terms \u2013 always paid his own way during his political career. \u201cWe all have friends that sometimes let us down,\u201d Gillum said of Corey, while also suggesting DeSantis was using the issue as a not-so-subtle way of trying to provoke a racial backlash in a campaign that could end with the election of Florida\u2019s first African-American governor. \u201cI\u2019m a hardworking person,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do.\u201d CNN\u2019s Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former President Jimmy Carter, a Georgia native, wrote a letter to GOP gubernatorial nominee Brian Kemp asking him to step down as secretary of state and hand off oversight of the state\u2019s elections to someone else since he is currently running for governor of the state. \u201cIn Georgia\u2019s upcoming gubernatorial election, popular confidence is threatened not only by the undeniable racial discrimination of the past and the serious questions that the federal courts have raised about the security of Georgia\u2019s voting machines, but also because you are now overseeing the election in which you are a candidate,\u201d Carter wrote in a letter to Kemp dated October 22. His letter to Kemp came as the Republican has received sweeping criticism for his oversight of the elections this year and faces accusations of suppressing the minority vote. Kemp\u2019s Democratic opponent, Stacey Abrams, has likewise called for him to resign ahead of the election this November. Carter added, \u201cIn order to foster voter confidence in the upcoming election, which will be especially important if the race ends up very close, I urge you to step aside and hand over to a neutral authority the responsibility of overseeing the governor\u2019s election.\u201d Carter is a former Democratic governor of Georgia and, as he noted in his letter, has observed elections around the world since the end of his presidency. A coalition of civil rights groups moved to sue Kemp earlier this October to block enforcement of an \u201cexact match\u201d requirement that they said endangered more than 50,000 voters, most of whom are African Americans. Kemp released a statement amid the criticism saying, \u201cWhile outside agitators disparage this office and falsely attack us, we have kept our head down and remained focused on ensuring secure, accessible, and fair elections for all voters.\u201d \u201cThe fact is that it has never been easier to register to vote and get engaged in the electoral process in Georgia, and we are incredibly proud to report this new record,\u201d the statement said. Should he remain in office through the election, Kemp\u2019s role would likely take on sustained attention if neither he nor Abrams secures a majority of the vote after polls close on Election Day. Georgia has a majority rule with a runoff voting system, meaning if neither candidate takes a majority of the vote, the two alone will compete in a runoff election. Asked in a debate about the prospect of a recount, Kemp said he would not recuse himself from election oversight. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very competent elections team to oversee that (recount) process,\u201d Kemp said. CNN\u2019s Marylynn Ryan and Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On a drizzly Saturday morning, nearly 200 people gathered in a downtown conference center here for what was billed as a \u201cblack joy\u201d brunch \u2013 complete with mimosas, glasses of sweet tea and plates of fried chicken and waffles. But the gathering wasn\u2019t merely social. As a DJ blared Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCrazy in Love\u201d over the sound system, the crowd of mostly African-American women pulled out their cell phones, logged into an online voter-outreach tool called Relay and began a texting marathon. In a little more than two hours, they had reached 65,000 infrequent African-American voters in a swath of rural Georgia, known as the Black Belt. Their messages warned of purges of African-American residents from the voting rolls and urged support for Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat who\u2019s vying to make history as the nation\u2019s first black female governor. This brunch and a crop of other quasi-social events organized around the country by the two-year-old Color of Change PAC seek to drive black turnout in key states. That includes Georgia, where African-Americans make up nearly 31% of the population but, like many voters, sit out off-year elections in droves. The event also illustrates how a little-known but growing network of African-American political groups is laboring behind the scenes to reshape who will vote in the midterms and engineer what Color of Change\u2019s executive director, Arisha Hatch, hopes will become a \u201cblack wave\u201d that sweeps Abrams and other Democrats into power. Their ultimate goal: build lasting political clout for African Americans, especially in the South, where more than half of the nation\u2019s black residents live. To do so, they will have to defy history and permanently change decades of voting behavior. Faced with a \u201cbigoted and destructive agenda\u201d in Washington, \u201cblack voters are seeing this as a transformative moment for the country,\u201d said Adrianne Shropshire, who runs BlackPAC, a two-year-old political action committee. \u201cThey are using their votes as their resistance,\u201d she said. BlackPAC, which helped boost turnout for winning Democrats last year in Virginia and Alabama, is now spending $8 million in the final sprint to Election Day to target African-American voters with radio ads and mailers in Georgia and nine other states. Stacey Abrams could forge a new path for Democrats in the Old South Other groups working to change the complexion of the midterm electorate include PowerPAC Georgia, a group affiliated with San Francisco lawyer and veteran Democratic strategist Steve Phillips, which is plowing in $5 million to help turn out 100,000 infrequent African-American voters who live outside the metro Atlanta area. Collective PAC, which bills itself as the EMILY\u2019s List for black candidates, is launching a national text-messaging program to reach about 2 million African-American voters in at least five states, including Florida and Mississippi. The Black Economic Alliance, a group started in this election cycle by African-American executives, is spending $2.6 million in a last-minute voter-mobilization push in 15 federal and state races. Color of Change PAC, whose financial backers include labor unions and Democratic billionaire Tom Steyer, plans to spend about $5 million to reach 1 million black voters. And a coalition of African-American groups, led by the Black Women\u2019s Roundtable is trying to mobilize at least 150,000 black women to vote in Georgia. Several of these groups, including BlackPAC and Collective PAC, came to life in 2016, as African-American political operatives prepared for the end of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency and a new era in American politics. Quentin James \u2013 who co-founded Collective PAC with his wife, former Obama campaign aide Stefanie Brown-James \u2013 said he also wanted to help turn the energy feeding Black Lives Matter protests into something more durable: greater political representation. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018I don\u2019t just want to protest. I want to run. I want a seat at the table to make the change,\u2019 \u201d he said. Black turnout helped swing two high-profile contests \u2013 the battles for a US Senate seat in Alabama and Virginia governor \u2013 to Democrats last year. Exit polls in Alabama\u2019s special election for the Senate found that 98% of black women who voted in that election backed Democrat Doug Jones, helping him beat Republican Roy Moore to become Alabama\u2019s first Democratic US senator in a quarter-century. Those voters and the black female activists who got them to the polls sparked comparisons from political commentators and late-night comedians alike to the little-known black female number-crunchers at NASA whose work, chronicled in the book and 2016 movie \u201cHidden Figures,\u201d helped the space agency achieve some of its biggest early accomplishments. Now some of these strategists believe they could use the Alabama template to achieve something even bigger next month, when Abrams and two other African-Americans, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum in Florida and former NAACP chief Ben Jealous in Maryland, compete in governors\u2019 races. Like Georgia, the contest in Florida is highly competitive. A recent CNN poll found Gillum 12 points ahead of his Republican rival, former US Rep. Ron DeSantis. Meanwhile, in the Republican stronghold of Mississippi, another African-American candidate, former congressman and US Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, is on the Nov. 6 ballot in a three-way US Senate race. Strategists in both parties say the contest, in a state with the highest percentage of black residents in the country, could end in a late-November runoff. \u201cWe are in a special moment,\u201d said LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter, who worked on the Alabama race and now is leading a bus tour, dubbed \u201cThe South is Rising,\u201d to mobilize African-American voters in Georgia and other states. \u201cI see black excellence when I see a Stacey Abrams, a Mike Espy, an Andrew Gillum,\u201d she said in a telephone interview. \u201cThese are the candidates I have been praying for.\u201d Republicans say it\u2019s unlikely these organizations can replicate the special election in Alabama, where Jones\u2019 rival, Roy Moore, faced accusations of sexual abuse. \u201cAll the controversy surrounding Judge Moore is what won that election,\u201d said Jason Thompson, a GOP national committeeman from Georgia. \u201cIt\u2019s not organic,\u201d he said of the activity by groups flooding his state on Abrams\u2019 behalf. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have an effect on people.\u201d The new African-American organizations say they expect to make gains with activism that extend far beyond the marquee races of the midterms. Brown, for instance, is advocating for a referendum on the Nov. 6 ballot in Nashville that would create a civilian-led board to review police actions. The Color of Change PAC is mobilizing voters to influence local prosecutor races around the country amid concerns about excessive police force. Wesley Bell, a Ferguson, Missouri, city council member who received support from Color of Change and the Collective PAC, in August toppled longtime St. Louis County prosecutor Robert McCulloch in the Democratic primary. McCulloch had faced intense scrutiny over his handling of the investigation into the 2014 fatal shooting by a white officer of a black teenager named Michael Brown in Ferguson. But for many of the activists, Georgia is ground zero in the battle to expand the midterm electorate. They face rough terrain. Georgia hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic governor in two decades. President Donald Trump won the state in 2016 by 5 percentage points. Abrams\u2019 supporters hope the state\u2019s growing racial and ethnic diversity and substantial investments by voter-outreach groups, including the New Georgia Project founded by Abrams in 2013, will pay off next month \u2013 and translate into electoral competitiveness in the 2020 White House battle. \u201cIf Abrams wins or even comes close, I think it confirms the view that some of us have held for a while: that Georgia is becoming a swing state and that in the not-distant future \u2026 could be up for grabs in the presidential election,\u201d said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist. But Chip Lake, a veteran Republican strategist in Georgia, said Abrams and her allies face stiff headwinds, in part because she\u2019s vying to succeed a popular figure in Georgia, two-term Republican Gov. Nathan Deal. \u201cVoters are really happy with the direction of state government,\u201d he said. \u201cAll things being equal, this is still a red state right now.\u201d Less than two weeks before Election Day, the campaign between Abrams, a former Democratic leader of the George House, and her Republican rival, Secretary of State Brian Kemp, is neck-and-neck, raising the possibility that the race won\u2019t be decided next month. A third candidate, Libertarian Ted Metz, trails far behind but could have a big impact on the outcome. If no candidate wins a majority on Nov. 6, the contest goes to a Dec. 4 runoff between the top two finishers. The race has been rocked repeatedly by allegations of voter suppression, and those battles spilled into the candidates\u2019 first televised debate. Abrams argued that Kemp had \u201csuppressed\u201d voting and \u201cscared\u201d Georgians from the polls during his tenure as the state\u2019s election chief. Kemp said he actually had lowered barriers. \u201cWe have a million more people on our voters\u2019 rolls today than we had when I took office,\u201d he said during Tuesday\u2019s faceoff. Voting access remained a flashpoint for the groups trying to drive African-American turnout. In an incident that quickly went viral, Brown\u2019s Black Voters Matter bus was stopped on the first day of in-person early voting from taking a group of African-American seniors to vote in Jefferson County, Georgia. A county administrator told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution he felt uncomfortable letting patrons of the county-run senior center leave with an \u201cunknown third party.\u201d Brown said the episode seemed to make the seniors, and other African-American voters who heard about it, only more determined to cast their ballots. Brown said one of the older women forced off the bus that day later told her: \u201d \u2018Baby, I got off that bus and went and got in my car and picked up my friend and both of us went and voted.\u2019 \u201c \u201cSo that one vote turned into two votes,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe transformed what would have been a very devastating moment into a moment of empowerment.\u201d So far, early voting is skyrocketing in Georgia. Nearly three times as many people had cast ballots as of Friday afternoon as had during the same period in the 2014 midterm elections, according to statistics compiled by Georgia Votes, a privately run website tracking voting data. African-American voters accounted for 29.3% of the total. Patricia Benjamin-Young, 51, said she had cast her ballot on the very first day of in-person early voting to ensure nothing got in the way of her support for Abrams. Nearly a week later, encouraged by members of her church, the corporate auditor joined Color of Change\u2019s brunch and sent her very first peer-to-peer political texts. In all, she communicated with about 30 people. Only one texted back \u201cSTOP,\u201d she said. One had voted already, and several others said they wanted to cast their ballots on Election Day. \u201cI felt good about knowing that people are getting out and are registered to vote,\u201d she said. Benjamin-Young also had a little fun, joining dozens of other participants who clutched their phones and continued texting while dancing the electric slide. Other attendees posed for photos against a wall adorned with pink paper flowers. Organizers encouraged the party atmosphere. \u201cVoter engagement in many states has become incredibly transactional,\u201d said Hatch of the Color of Change PAC. \u201cLots of folks hear from the candidates or hear from the party a week before the election, two weeks before the election, and they never hear from them again.\u201d Hatch said her group instead wants to build a community of activists who will stay engaged after Nov. 6 in places like Georgia. \u201cWe are trying to make volunteering fun and build that muscle within families.\u201d Erica Waverly, a 38-year-old union organizer, said politics runs in her blood. At age 3, she had already joined her father and five siblings on the streets of Birmingham, Alabama, to distribute sample ballots. Now living outside Atlanta, Waverly brought her young daughters, Esa and Eri, to the text-a-thon \u201cas a way of continuing the tradition,\u201d she said. She expressed little doubt that Abrams would prevail, despite the ongoing battles over voting access. \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to see the first black president in their lifetimes and the first black woman governor of Georgia and the country,\u201d she said as her girls ran around the conference center lobby, clanging a plastic toy cowbell.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty awesome time to be alive right now.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Washington is locked in a destructive and acrimonious ritual that plays out every time President Donald Trump is called upon to lead in a moment of national peril \u2013 and that ensures that America\u2019s political estrangement will only deepen. The controversy over explosive devices sent to prominent Democrats, a liberal billionaire and CNN \u2013 all frequent targets of the President\u2019s rhetoric \u2013 is following a pattern repeated over and over during over 21 tumultuous months. When a natural disaster, a political controversy or a mass shooting takes place, the media and political establishment set expectations for Trump to invoke a poetic vision of common purpose and unity, craving a spectacle in line with the traditional conventions of the presidency at great historical moments. Trump then produces a scripted response that is adequate, but in the moment or in subsequent days undercuts that message with radioactive comments or tweets that spark fierce criticism and mobilize the conservative media machine in his defense while he often deflects blame back onto the media as he did in a pointed 3 a.m. tweet early Friday morning. Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, \u201cit\u2019s just not Presidential!\u201d It suggests the President has little desire to play the role of national counselor being forced upon him \u2013 one that is a poor fit given his deliberately divisive style. The drama usually ends with another layer of bile added to the nation\u2019s politics. That a President who has based his political career on crushing conventions and norms should so constantly be tripped up by the behavioral and ceremonial codes that define the role of head of state is deeply ironic. But Trump knows that refusing to bow to the standards the establishment demands is the secret of his bond with his loyal political base. \u201cDo you see how nice I\u2019m behaving tonight?\u201d he said on Wednesday, letting a crowd in Wisconsin in on the joke of a performance toned down after the bombs were discovered. These dual forces operating on Trump help explain why the political divides and mutual mistrust cleaving America \u2013 between the President\u2019s loyalists and critics \u2013 are unbridgeable and will produce a bitter 2020 election campaign. The last few days have stuck to the script. As soon as authorities discovered that homemade bombs had been sent to former President Barack Obama and the home of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as other Trump targets like George Soros and CNN, eyes started turning to the White House. The President had to say something, and he did so at the top of a previously scheduled event on Wednesday. \u201cI just want to tell you that, in these times, we have to unify.\u00a0We have to come together, and send one very clear, strong, unmistakable message that acts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America,\u201d Trump said, slamming the \u201cegregious\u201d and \u201cabhorrent\u201d attacks. It was a strong statement on the face of it, though was notable in failing to name any of the victims, all often the focus of Trump\u2019s ire. But Trump got a passing grade in the eyes of most commentators. It was only later that his unwillingness to play the role presidential tradition requires became clear. At a rally in Wisconsin, the President undercut his message by appearing to blame the media and his opponents for the sour national mood in which the pipe bombs had been crafted and delivered. His performance not only flouted the paternal conventions of the modern presidency \u2013 which date at least to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s fireside chats during the Great Depression \u2013 it also suggested that when he\u2019s not in a formal, scripted setting, Trump really cares only about his own political motivations. \u201cIt was one of the worst moments in the Trump presidency,\u201d said CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley. \u201cIt was a golden opportunity to be large, to try to say something that would unify the country. \u2026 He came off, in my opinion, as a very small president.\u201d The President\u2019s attitude set off a media storm, and then a backlash from his White House. Press secretary Sarah Sanders accused reporters of always focusing \u201con the negative\u201d and not playing their own role to foster national unity. Trump next fired off a tweet unleashing new acrimony, sparking fresh accusations about his attitude toward norms and constitutional freedoms and his understanding of what a president is supposed to do. The fight back on such occasions resonates with Trump supporters, however, who see the President as the victim of unrelenting and slanted news coverage, a factor that endears him to them even more. A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News. It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST! One Trump confidant told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny that criticism of the President\u2019s behavior over the bomb scares just cemented Trump\u2019s view that he is \u201ctreated with hostility and unfairly \u2013 there\u2019s no talking him out of that.\u201d Around 3 a.m. Friday morning, Trump again took to Twitter to defend himself and criticize the media saying that the media has been \u201cblaming me for the current spate of Bombs.\u201d He went on to claim that while he faces much media criticism, he is called \u201cnot Presidential\u201d when he hits back. This was not the first time that the criticism of him left Trump brooding after critics charged that his performance fell well short of the standards of decorum and decency expected of a commander-in-chief and revealed a leader unable to rise above political combat to console and steer his nation. After violence at a white supremacists rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year in which an anti-racism protester was killed, Trump was initially criticized for an inadequate response but then delivered a speech condemning an \u201cegregious display of bigotry, hatred and violence\u201d that has \u201cno place in America.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t help himself. A day later in a Trump Tower news conference, he blamed \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence, setting off a days-long debate about race. \u201cYou had a group on one side that was bad. You had a group on the other side that was also very violent. Nobody wants to say that. I\u2019ll say it right now,\u201d Trump said. It was almost as if the President couldn\u2019t let his scripted, \u201cpresidential\u201d-style remarks have the last word. Maybe it\u2019s a symptom of his rebellious character. Or perhaps it shows a need to signal his loyal base, which embraced his revolt against the establishment, that he hasn\u2019t gone native in Washington. The same scenario unfolded when Trump returned from Finland amid outrage over his deference to Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit. He read out a statement designed to make clear he accepted intelligence community assessments on Moscow\u2019s interference in the 2016 US election. But he couldn\u2019t resist adding a caveat \u2013 \u201ccould be other people also\u201d \u2013 in an ad-lib that undermined his statement but was also an act of defiance against Washington\u2019s expectations. Every time the weight of convention and tradition requires him to act one way, Trump the outsider and iconoclast can\u2019t bring himself to comply. And each time, the criticism that Trump stirs, and consequent fury within his inner circle at the media response, makes the polarization even worse. It\u2019s been a trait of his presidency right from the beginning, emerging when he went to the CIA on his first full day in office, attacked the media for its coverage of his inaugural crowds and effectively conducted a campaign rally in front of the agency\u2019s revered memorial wall to fallen officers. Some commentators believe Trump simply has no desire to honor the moral authority of the presidency and simply sees it as a vehicle for his own power, prestige and self-glorification. Others suggest he doesn\u2019t understand the magnitude of his responsibilities. \u201cHe is now the President of the United States. He is not on a talk show somewhere,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin on Thursday. \u201cWhen that position of power is spewing hateful rhetoric, that has an effect.\u201d Another theory about Trump\u2019s behavior could be that he has banked so exclusively on his political base that he cannot allow himself to do anything that would damage his image as the ultimate rabble-rouser. The President also knows he\u2019s most effective when he\u2019s attacking an enemy, in the heat of a fight. And a political method that relies on inflaming cultural, racial and societal divides means he might not ever be accepted by those who despise him anyway. But that all leaves a bigger question: What will be the impact on American life and national unity of years of such civic discord? Trump may simply be unable to summon the words and the aspiration to bring the country together \u2013 as President George W. Bush did on a pile of rubble after 9/11 \u2013 or he may not even want to do so. Ultimately, as a self-styled disruptor, he may realize that it\u2019s simply impossible to honor the historical expectations and conventions of his job while being true to himself. And if it comes to a choice, there\u2019s no doubt which side of that equation he will choose.",

            "article_content": "Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum received a ticket to the Broadway show \u201cHamilton\u201d from a group that included an undercover FBI agent, according to text and email records released on Tuesday under subpoena by the lawyer for a former Florida lobbyist. The revelation is the latest development regarding a federal investigation into public corruption in Tallahassee, Florida, where Gillum has been mayor since 2014.The records, which were subpoenaed by the state ethics commissions last week according to the Tampa Bay Times, cast doubt on the explanation from Gillum\u2019s campaign that the mayor received the ticket from his brother Marcus. The FBI probe centers on whether developers successfully influenced city projects. At one point in the probe, an undercover agent successfully infiltrated Gillum\u2019s inner circle. No one has been charged with any wrongdoing. Gillum has repeatedly said the FBI told him he is not a focus of the investigation. But his attendance at a Broadway show with lobbyist and longtime friend Adam Corey, along with his brother and the federal agent, who went by Mike Miller, has been used by political opponents to suggest Gillum is potentially under more direct scrutiny. At issue is a 2016 trip to New York, where the group saw the hit musical \u201cHamilton.\u201d Gillum\u2019s campaign has said his brother was the source for his ticket. But within the nearly 150 pages of records provided on Tuesday by Corey to ethics officials, text messages between Gillum and Corey present a murkier picture. In a message from August 8, 2016, Corey texts Gillum saying, \u201cMike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight at 8pm,\u201d then asks if Gillum can join them and notes: \u201cI think your brother has already arrived by the way.\u201d Gillum\u2019s campaign pushed back against any implication that he had misled the public, saying that his brother, the previously cited source of the ticket, was part of the \u201ccrew\u201d cited in the text. \u201cThese records vindicate and add more evidence that at every turn I was paying my own way or was with my family, for all trips, including picking up tickets from my brother, Marcus, who was with a group of his own friends,\u201d the campaign said in a statement. In a Facebook Live video Tuesday night, Gillum dismissed the revelations as \u201cdistractions\u201d from his campaign message. \u201cWhat I wanted to make sure that folks understood was that these messages only confirm what we have said all along,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did go to see \u2018Hamilton.\u2019 I did get my ticket for \u2018Hamilton\u2019 from my brother. At the time we believed that they were reserved by friends of Adam\u2019s, Mike Miller.\u201d \u201cWhen I got there after work \u2013 got my ticket, went in and saw it, assumed my brother paid for it and so far as I know that was the deal,\u201d he continued. Gillum\u2019s Republican opponent Ron DeSantis commented on the news while speaking in Miami. \u201cAndrew\u2019s running on impeaching Trump. OK, I mean, I don\u2019t know what for,\u201d he said. \u201cTrump did not receive a free Hamilton ticket from an undercover FBI agent.\u201d In their CNN debate Sunday, DeSantis questioned Gillum about the source of the tickets and who footed the bill. \u201cDid you pay for the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ticket, or did the undercover FBI agent pay for the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ticket?\u201d DeSantis asked. Gillum never directly answered, but insisted he had \u2013 in general terms \u2013 always paid his own way during his political career. \u201cWe all have friends that sometimes let us down,\u201d Gillum said of Corey, while also suggesting DeSantis was using the issue as a not-so-subtle way of trying to provoke a racial backlash in a campaign that could end with the election of Florida\u2019s first African American governor. \u201cI\u2019m a hard working person,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cI know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do.\u201d",

            "article_content": "No policy decision during former President Barack Obama\u2019s first two years contributed more to the Democratic loss of the House of Representatives in 2010 than the party\u2019s drive to pass the Affordable Care Act. Now, no policy decision in President Trump\u2019s first two years is boosting Democratic hopes of recapturing the House majority more than the failed Republican effort to repeal the ACA. The backlash against the GOP attempt to rescind the ACA represents a stunning shift in the politics of health care. Signed into law by Obama in early 2010, the ACA expanded health coverage to roughly 20 million previously uninsured Americans and imposed comprehensive changes in the operation of insurance markets \u2013 all in the direction of requiring greater sharing of risk between the healthy and sick and balancing an individual requirement to obtain health insurance with a guarantee that coverage would be available. After confidently attacking the law in four consecutive elections, Republicans for the first time this year are playing defense. They are especially struggling to defend the provisions in the House-passed repeal bill, and a separate lawsuit by attorneys general and governors from 20 Republican states, to unravel the law\u2019s requirement that insurers provide coverage, with no surcharge, to patients with preexisting health conditions. Over half of all Democratic ads in House and Senate races over roughly the past month have dealt with some aspect of the health care debate, far more than in the past, according to ad tracking by the Wesleyan Media Project. \u201cHealth care is the defining issue of the election,\u201d Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who is consulting for several liberal groups on the issue, including Protect Our Care, says flatly. Here's what should excite and depress Democrats so far in 2018 This shift in the law\u2019s political fortunes reaffirms the belief of many political scientists \u2013 and the fears of many conservative thinkers \u2013 that government benefits are hard to revoke once they have been established. It also represents a delayed vindication for the ACA\u2019s advocates, who long argued that voters would warm to it once it was fully implemented. \u201cIt took more time than you\u2019d like from a political standpoint,\u201d said David Axelrod, the chief White House political strategist for Obama when he passed the law. \u201cI remember, and I\u2019m sure there are many senators \u2013 and more to the point former senators \u2013 who would tell you that I came to the caucus and talked about the fact that however unpopular this is now, when it is implemented it will be popular. It\u2019s an axiom of politics that I think is true: it\u2019s much harder to take away things after they are in effect than it is to demonize the unknown, especially at a time of great cynicism about government.\u201d What\u2019s less clear, though, is whether this fall\u2019s Republican tactical retreat on the law means that it has outlasted the GOP efforts to undo it. After the strong backlash during the campaign, some party professionals believe it is unlikely that Republicans could muster the votes for another effort to fundamentally repeal the law, even if they maintain control of the House and Senate next month. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell recently declared that Republicans could make another run at undoing the law if the November election leaves them in control of both chambers, and Vice President Mike Pence has made a similar declaration. Other GOP Senators, such as Nevada\u2019s Dean Heller, have also promised another try at dismantling the ACA if the party holds the House and expands its Senate majority. Long-time Republican strategist Bill Kristol, founder of the Weekly Standard magazine, led conservative efforts against Bill Clinton\u2019s universal health coverage plan in the 1990s. Now he sees public reluctance to change the health care system much in any direction. \u201cWhichever party is on the offense on health care, is trying to change the status quo, is running a risk, because people for all their general dissatisfaction with the system, they are mostly reasonably content with their health care, and very nervous about it getting worse,\u201d Kristol says. The Republican effort to repeal or retrench the ACA has already extended much longer than the struggle over any other modern safety net program. After Franklin Roosevelt signed Social Security into law in 1935, for instance, Alf Landon, the Republican presidential nominee in 1936, ran on repealing the law. But after Landon won only two states, Wendell Willkie, the GOP presidential nominee in 1940, ran on expanding Social Security. Although Congressional Republicans continued some rearguard actions against the law through the 1940s, the party never again proposed complete repeal. There is still a huge divide on gender roles in the US Medicare and Medicaid, the giant federal health care programs for the elderly and the poor respectively, became politically impregnable even more rapidly. In his 1964 campaign, GOP presidential nominee Barry Goldwater denounced Medicare as a step toward socialism. But after Lyndon Johnson and the Democratic Congress passed Medicare and Medicaid in 1965, neither a meaningful number of GOP Congressional candidates, or, more importantly 1968 presidential nominee Richard Nixon, ran on repealing the new programs. No GOP presidential nominee ever did, though Democrats have sharply attacked Republicans whenever they have proposed to reduce spending on the program, or to change their structure by transforming Medicare into a voucher system or Medicaid into a block grant (as outgoing House Speaker Paul Ryan has done). The contrast with the ACA is striking. Both Mitt Romney in 2012 and Trump in 2016 pledged to repeal the law, the first time two successive nominees had promised to undo a new entitlement. After the 2016 election delivered Republicans unified control of Congress and the White House, legislation to scrap the ACA passed the House and fell just one vote short in the Senate, when the late John McCain dramatically turned a thumbs down on the bill. In all, though, just three Senate Republicans and 20 in the House, voted against rescinding the law. GOP lawmakers were able to zero out the financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance in passing their tax reform last December, after which Trump tried to declare: \u201cEssentially, we are getting rid of Obamacare\u201d even though the vast majority of the law has remained intact. The Republican determination to erase the ACA reflected not only their philosophical disagreement with the law, but a conviction that opposition was good politics. And indeed through the law\u2019s first years, more Americans consistently expressed an unfavorable than favorable view of it. But those attitudes had already started to shift by the time the GOP began its repeal drive in 2017 \u2013 and the repeal effort itself accelerated the reversal. Polling by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation during the October of election years tracks the trend. In October 2010, just before the GOP landslide that swept the party to control of the House, Kaiser found that 44% of Americans viewed the ACA unfavorably while 42% viewed it favorably. The balance was even more lopsided among voters: exit polls that fall found that 56% of white voters, including not only 57% of non-college whites but also 55% of college-educated whites, supported repeal. By the 2014 mid-term election, after the glitch-riddled 2013 launch of the ACA\u2019s federal website, Kaiser\u2019s numbers had tilted further toward opposition, with 36% favorable and 43% unfavorable. In the exit polls that fall, slightly more Americans said the law went too far than said it was about right or didn\u2019t go far enough. By the November 2016 election, though, with the law\u2019s implementation almost completed, opinion began to shift. Through Obama\u2019s final two years, the Kaiser poll occasionally found as many, or more, Americans viewed the law favorably as unfavorably. And once the Republican Congress seriously began its repeal drive, the share of Americans expressing positive views of the law lastingly moved ahead of those who viewed it negatively; in this month\u2019s survey 49% of adults said they viewed the law favorably, compared to 42% who are unfavorable. There's a suburban tsunami driving 2018 \u201cIf you look back at that time what we always said was that repeal would be unpopular and the law would get more popular as the benefits kicked in,\u201d said Ferguson, who served as communications director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2010, when the ACA backlash helped propel landslide Republican gains. \u201cIt just took longer and it was more painful than a lot of people hoped or expected. But the predictions weren\u2019t wrong.\u201d Large racial and partisan gaps still color attitudes toward the ACA. Even in the latest Kaiser survey about three-fourths of Republicans still view the law unfavorably, as do half of whites (compared to about two-fifths with positive views.) But detailed results provided to CNN by Kaiser show that the law has gained more support among all the key groups of white adults since 2010. Compared to the October 2010 survey, opinion about the law among minorities in the October 2018 poll is virtually unchanged: 62% of non-whites supported the law then and 63% do now. But over that period, the share expressing a favorable opinion about it has grown among college-educated white women from 45% to 57%; from 39% to 48% among college-educated white men; 30% to 41% among white women without a college degree; and, more modestly, from 29% to 34% among white men without a college degree. Though most non-college whites still oppose the law, the gains among them are even more substantial when compared to 2014, when only about one-fourth of both blue-collar white men and women viewed it favorably. In the 2014 exit poll a majority of both non college educated and college educated whites still said the ACA went too far. The ACA\u2019s protections for pre-existing conditions have proven even more popular than the overall law: Kaiser polling has found that three-fourths of adults believe insurance companies should be prohibited from denying coverage because of such health needs, and nearly as many say they should be barred from charging such patients more for coverage. The House GOP\u2019s repeal bill explicitly authorized states to allow insurance companies to charge patients with preexisting conditions more for their coverage. And the lawsuit against the ACA from Republican states also explicitly seeks to remove those protections; in its court filing the Trump Administration supported their legal position. On Monday, even as Republicans proclaim their determination to protect such patients, the Administration announced changes in ACA regulations that analyst say could also make it more difficult for consumers with preexisting conditions to purchase affordable coverage. A Republican stronghold has become ground zero in 2018 Democrats are stressing their commitment to defending protections for pre-existing conditions more than any other health care issue this year. But they are pushing on other fronts too. In several key governor\u2019s races \u2013 particularly Florida and Georgia \u2013Democrats are running hard on accepting the ACA\u2019s funds to expand eligibility for Medicaid, which Republican governors and legislators in those states have refused to do. Other Democrats vow to lower prescription drug costs, partly by ending the current ban on Medicare negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for lower prices. And some Democrats, like Scott Wallace, who is challenging Republican Brian Fitzpatrick in a suburban Philadelphia district, are directly warning that Republicans will launch another effort to repeal the ACA if they retain control of both chambers. \u201cThe ACA will never be truly safe until Democrats have the majority in the House and Senate,\u201d Wallace tweeted. This Democratic offensive has forced Republicans \u2013 including Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley, the GOP\u2019s Senate nominee there, who joined the state lawsuit to unravel the ACA\u2019s regulations \u2013 to insist they intend to protect patients with preexisting conditions by other means, though none have revealed a plausible plan to do so. The Democrats\u2019 renewed confidence on health care also encouraged many in their party to propose moving beyond the existing ACA. Several liberal candidates are pushing Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 plan to create a single payer government system that would eliminate private insurance; more modestly, others have proposed to allow working-age adults to buy into Medicare (which is now available only to seniors) as an alternative to the private companies offering insurance on the ACA exchanges. Kristol predicts that a Democratic House looking to expand the ACA could run into the same hesitance about change that stung the Republican House when it tried to repeal it. \u201cThe great irony is the progressive wing of the Democrats want to be for \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 but the actual core of the Democratic message is a conservative message with a little \u2018c\u2019, which is don\u2019t mess with Obamacare [the ACA],\u201d he says. \u201cThat is not consistent realistically with Medicare for all.\u201d The debate on whether to expand the ACA will come into focus after November if Democrats take the House, Senate or both. On the more immediate question of whether or not Democrats make those gains, a far more important variable will be whether Republicans in swing states and districts can defend their efforts to unravel the existing law. \u201cThe irony of the whole thing is John McCain saved them from themselves,\u201d says Axelrod, now a CNN senior political commentator. \u201cIt would have been catastrophic for them if they had [passed repeal] .The president may revile McCain for having done it; McConnell may have been unhappy about it; but the political ramifications of actually having reversed the Affordable Care Act would have been really dire for them and they are just getting a little taste of that now.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hours after a new CNN poll found him trailing by double digits in their race to become the next governor of Florida, Republican Ron DeSantis leapt out of the gates to attack Democrat Andrew Gillum in his opening remarks at their first debate. DeSantis, a former GOP congressman who resigned to focus on this contest, began the CNN debate by calling Gillum a \u201cfailed mayor\u201d and alleging that he was \u201cinvolved in corruption\u201d before the Democrat had a turn to speak. \u201cWell, that was a mouthful,\u201d Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, deadpanned in response. Few campaigns in 2018 have run so directly parallel to the broader national political fight \u2013 and this, like so much else in the era, had the feel of a brawl. DeSantis spent more time on the offensive, perhaps feeling he needed to change the trajectory of a campaign that\u2019s found him consistently on the back foot, while Gillum sought to downplay accusations of impropriety, while talking up his health care plan and casting himself as the more competent choice to lead the state. The rapid-fire, one-hour debate kicked off with a sharp exchange \u2013 initiated by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, who moderated from Tampa \u2013 over climate change and its outsized effects on a state that was slammed only a couple weeks ago by yet another devastating hurricane and is currently at war with a harmful algae bloom. DeSantis denied claims he denies the science behind the issue, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an alarmist. I want to look at this and do what makes sense for Florida,\u201d and touted his recent endorsement by the Everglades Trust. Gillum, who has the backing of the Sierra Club, called the Republican \u201can election year environmentalist.\u201d \u201cWhat Florida voters need to know is that when they elect me governor, they are going to have a governor who believes in science,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich we haven\u2019t had for quite some time in this state.\u201d DeSantis was also forced to confront concerns that he has tried to use Gillum\u2019s race against him. The most high profile incident came in the first 24 hours after the primary, when DeSantis went on Fox News and warned Floridians not to \u201cmonkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda\u201d and voting for Gillum, who stands to be the state\u2019s first African American governor. The Republican vigorously denied that his comment was about race, saying, \u201cFloridians can know that I\u2019ll be a governor for all Floridians.\u201d Gillum responded, \u201cHe has only continued in the course of his campaign to draw all the attention he can to the color of my skin. The truth is, I\u2019ve been black all of my life. So far as I know, I will die black.\u201d Though his upset victory in the primary was driven by an endorsement from President Donald Trump, DeSantis sought to keep some space from the President, never quite answering whether he considered Trump a good \u201crole model,\u201d and instead talking up the administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Gillum, who also called DeSantis a Trump \u201cstooge,\u201d took the question as an opportunity to tie his opponent to the President \u201cDonald Trump is weak,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cAnd he performs as all weak people do: they become bullies and Mr. DeSantis is his acolyte. He\u2019s trying out to be the Trump apprentice at every turn. He\u2019s tweeting at him and he\u2019s talking to him. He\u2019s showing up. He\u2019s complimenting him.\u201d After the face-off ended, Trump tweeted to declare for DeSantis \u201ca great debate victory tonight against Andrew Gillum.\u201d Early on in the course of a rollicking hour, the candidates also broke into a heated exchange over suggestions from the DeSantis camp that an ongoing FBI investigation into public corruption in Tallahassee has implicated Gillum in wrongdoing. Gillum has repeatedly said that FBI told him he was not a focus of the probe, which centers on the relationships between developers and lobbyists in the state capital, including one with longstanding connections to Gillum. In the course of the investigation, Gillum once unknowingly attended the Broadway hit musical \u201cHamilton\u201d in the company of an undercover agent. \u201cDid you pay for the Hamilton tickets?,\u201d DeSantis asked. Gillum insisted he\u2019s always paid his own way as he came up as a young political star, but never directly answered DeSantis. His campaign has said the ticket was given to him by his brother Marcus, who attended the show with him, the agent and a lobbyist friend, Adam Corey, who volunteered as finance chair on Gillum\u2019s 2014 mayoral campaign. \u201cWe all have friends that sometimes let us down,\u201d Gillum said of Corey, while also pushing back at DeSantis with a suggestion this, too, was a racial dog whistle: \u201cI\u2019m a hard working person,\u201d he added. \u201cI know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do.\u201d The candidates\u2019 exchange over health care was less bruising, but pushed DeSantis into a political corner inhabited by many Republicans this midterm season, as he effectively pitted himself against the party\u2019s own efforts to dismantle Obamacare. Though those efforts, both in Congress and the courts, succeeded in changing the law and ending coverage regulations for people who have pre-existing conditions, DeSantis said, he would push through statewide legislation to counteract them. \u201cI will sign a bill to take care of people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d he said, before pivoting to jab repeatedly at Gillum\u2019s support for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer health care. DeSantis warned that it would end current programs, many of them popular \u2013 which is true, though single-payer advocates argue the replacement would be more comprehensive. Gillum flinched a bit, not defending the program which is a non-starter in Florida and most states around the country, instead seeking to talk up his plans to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. DeSantis opposes that, but has not yet released a health care plan of his own. His campaign website\u2019s \u201cissues\u201d page makes no mention of it.",

            "article_content": "Only a few days after making his return to the campaign trail following a hurricane-enforced hiatus, Florida Democrat Andrew Gillum will square off with Republican Ron DeSantis on Sunday night in the first debate of their high stakes gubernatorial race. CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper will host the one-hour face-to-face beginning at 8 p.m. ET, from the WEDU studios in Tampa. The debate will be broadcast live on CNN. With only a little more than two weeks now before Election Day, and early voting starting on Monday, DeSantis is likely eyeing the showdown as an opportunity to alter the course of a race he\u2019s consistently trailed in the polls. A new CNN survey conducted by SSRS out Sunday found Gillum with a double-digit lead, 54% to 42%. At a campaign stop on Friday, Gillum, the young progressive mayor of Tallahassee, predicted the Republican former congressman would hit him low and hard \u2013 then warned he was prepared to return the favor. \u201c(DeSantis) is going to call me a socialist. He\u2019s going to call me corrupt. He\u2019s going to throw his covered-up versions of racial epithets. He\u2019s going to call me anti-Israel,\u201d Gillum said, comparing his opponent to President Donald Trump, whose endorsement DeSantis rode to victory in the August primary. \u201cI\u2019m going to do everything I can to have a debate that is deserving of the people of Florida,\u201d Gillum said. \u201cBut if I have to go there, I\u2019m going to go there.\u201d Though they have blanketed the airwaves with ads, the debate will offer Gillum and DeSantis a chance to introduce themselves to voters in a more intimate and unscripted setting. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of this that\u2019s sort of the initial pass/fail thing everyone has to go through,\u201d Florida-based Democratic strategist Steve Schale said. \u201cObviously, I think Andrew\u2019s done more of this stuff in his life, but both of them are fairly new quantities on the statewide scale and stage.\u201d DeSantis, like Gillum, was a surprise primary winner. But his transition to the general election has been a rocky one. After outlasting Adam Putnam, the state\u2019s agriculture commissioner, DeSantis went on Fox News to warn Floridians not to \u201cmonkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda\u201d and voting for Gillum, who stands to be the state\u2019s first African American governor. \u201cIt has zero to do with race,\u201d DeSantis said during the firestorm that followed. \u201cIt has everything to do with whether we want Florida to go in a good direction.\u201d DeSantis resigned from his House seat soon thereafter to focus on the gubernatorial contest. But his campaign, which in the primaries was almost entirely predicated on his fealty to Trump, has moved slowly in rolling out a policy platform. DeSantis opposes Medicaid expansion in the state, which Gillum ardently supports, but has still not \u2013 just weeks out from the election \u2013 released a comprehensive health care plan. His website\u2019s issues page doesn\u2019t address it, which polling has shown to be a top concern for Florida voters. On Saturday morning, though, the Republican got another boost from Trump, who tweeted his support \u2013 and an attack on Gillum. \u201cDeSantis is working hard. A great Congressman and top student at Harvard & Yale, Ron will be a record setting governor for Florida. Rick Scott gave him tremendous foundations to further build on,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHis opponent runs one of the worst & most corrupt cities in USA!\u201d Ron @RonDeSantisFL DeSantis is working hard. A great Congressman and top student at Harvard & Yale, Ron will be a record setting governor for Florida. Rick Scott gave him tremendous foundations to further build on. His opponent runs one of the worst & most corrupt cities in USA! Gillum promptly fired back, quoting Trump and suggesting the President hadn\u2019t been brave enough to mention him by name: \u201cWhen you lie about me from the most powerful office in the world,\u201d Gillum wrote, \u201cand still don\u2019t have the courage to @ me\u2026\u201d Trump was referring to an ongoing federal investigation into public corruption in Tallahassee. Gillum has said the FBI told him he was not a focus of the probe. Earlier this month, his campaign sent a letter to television stations asking that they halt running a Florida Republican Party ad that ties Gillum directly to it. Gillum has successfully united Florida Democrats \u2013 one of his primary opponents, Chris King, is now his running mate \u2013 and has the uniform support of the political left\u2019s best-known national figures. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders was an early supporter of Gillum, who has received significant financial backing from liberal megadonors Tom Steyer and George Soros. Gillum will appear alongside Hillary Clinton at a private event later in the week and, separately, at events with former Vice President Joe Biden, who will also be campaigning for Sen. Bill Nelson, the incumbent Democrat now in a tight re-election fight with GOP Gov. Rick Scott. DeSantis and Gillum will meet again, for their second and likely final debate, on Wednesday in South Florida.",

            "article_content": "One suburban Georgia county has become a flashpoint for concerns over voter suppression for rejecting hundreds of mail-in absentee ballots weeks before Election Day. Gwinnett County, located northeast of Atlanta, now faces two federal lawsuits and accusations from voting rights activists who say the rejections disproportionately affect minority voters, particularly Asian Americans and African Americans. The county has rejected 595 absentee ballots, which account for more than a third of the total absentee-ballot rejections in the state, even though Gwinnett County accounts for only about 6% of absentee ballots submitted in Georgia, according to state data analyzed by CNN Friday. More than 300 of the rejected ballots belonged to African Americans and Asian Americans. Officials tossed out the ballots due to missing birthdates, address discrepancies, signatures that do not match those on registration records and other issues, according to the data. A lawsuit brought by the Coalition for Good Governance on behalf of a group of Georgia voters demands that a judge order the county to notify voters within one day of the rejections and provide adequate time to address the discrepancies. Court documents in a separate suit with similar demands filed by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of two advocacy groups describe the county\u2019s rejections as a \u201cconstitutional train wreck.\u201d That suit specifically challenges the county\u2019s rejection of ballots based on signature mismatches, which the suit calls a violation of due process. A judge has scheduled a hearing for that case Tuesday. Gwinnett County released a statement that said it\u2019s \u201ccommitted to a process that protects the voting rights of all of its citizens and fully complies with the law in the process,\u201d but some voters have found the rejections confusing. Lilieth Walters, whose ballot was tossed due to a signature issue, said she did not know her ballot was rejected until CNN told her. She said she has worked at poll stations and plans to help others vote on November 6. \u201cWhat was the issue with my signature?\u201d she asked. \u201cMaybe I didn\u2019t sign the same way I normally do, but \u2026 a signature shouldn\u2019t prevent one from voting.\u201d State data shows Carol Hutcheson\u2019s ballot was denied due to a missing birthdate, but she said she hadn\u2019t received any notification from the county even though she said she mailed in her absentee ballot about two weeks ago. \u201cI swear I thought I put the right information on there. Right now, I\u2019m fuming,\u201d said Hutcheson, a Republican. Three others reached by CNN said they received letters from the county notifying them of the rejections. The letters included instructions on how to resubmit absentee ballots or vote in person. Voters whose absentee ballots were rejected can still vote in person on Election Day or during the early voting period that is already underway. \u201cI screwed up and it was my fault,\u201d said Clyde Hall, who said he made a mistake when writing his birthdate on his absentee ballot, but he didn\u2019t consider the rejection a problem because he could cast another ballot. Gwinnett County spokesman Joe Sorenson declined to answer specific questions from CNN related to the rejections, citing ongoing litigation, but he said in a statement that none of the allegations in the lawsuits assert any violations of the law by the Gwinnett County Board of Registration and Elections or the county. \u201cThe handling of absentee ballot applications and the acceptance and rejection of ballots by Gwinnett County (have) complied with the law and will continue to do so,\u201d Sorenson said. Michael McDonald, a University of Florida associate professor of political science, tracks state voter data and found that Gwinnett County tossed out 15% of absentee ballots submitted by Asian Americans, 11.4% of those submitted by African Americans and only 4% of those submitted by whites. \u201cIt\u2019s not the fault of the voters. It\u2019s the fault of the elections officials for creating a confusing ballot,\u201d McDonald said. McDonald believes part of the problem stems from the design of the county\u2019s absentee ballot. He said because a comparatively high number of Latinos live in Gwinnett County, election officials there are federally mandated to include both English and Spanish instructions on the ballots. He said the absentee ballots now contain long strings of bilingual text that could appear confusing. Kristen Clarke, the president of the Washington DC-based advocacy group Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the racial disparities in the county\u2019s rejections set off red flags for her organization. Clarke\u2019s group sent a letter to Gwinnett County that argued officials should \u201cerr on the side of the voter\u201d and accept more of the ballots, since she said Georgia county officials have discretion to decide if ballots contain sufficient information to establish a voter\u2019s identity and eligibility. \u201cSadly, this is a pattern we\u2019re seeing across Georgia this election cycle. We are seeing policies and practices being implemented in ways that bear more heavily to minority voters across the state,\u201d Clarke said. Clarke\u2019s organization and the Campaign Legal Center filed a separate lawsuit earlier this month that challenges the constitutionality of Georgia\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d law, which stipulates that voters\u2019 registration applications must match information on their state ID\u2019s or Social Security records. A recent Associated Press report found about 53,000 people, the majority of whom are African-Americans, had their registrations placed in limbo because of some type of mismatch with that information. Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who is also running as the Republican candidate for governor, has said that voters on the pending list can vote in November\u2019s election so long as they show proper identification at polling places. Kemp has also called reports of voter suppression a politically driven rallying point for Democrats. \u201cDespite any claim to the contrary, it has never been easier to register to vote in Georgia and actively engage in the electoral process,\u201d Kemp said in a previous press release. Kemp\u2019s spokesperson with the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office, Candice Broce, said her office opened an investigation on behalf of the state\u2019s election board to ensure counties follow the law on absentee ballots. \u201cWe will not be bullied by out-of-state organizations or political operatives who want to generate headlines and advance a baseless narrative. We will do our part to keep elections secure, accessible, and fair in Georgia,\u201d Broce said.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has long used Twitter to define \u2013 and defame \u2013 his political opponents, but about 20 months into his presidency it\u2019s become blindingly clear that his use of social media to target critics, disloyal former lieutenants and the media tells us more about him than anyone else. Trump\u2019s attacks took a particularly dehumanizing turn in late August, when he called former aide Omarosa Manigault Newman, the only African-American to serve in a senior role in his White House, a \u201cdog.\u201d On Tuesday, he went back to the same fetid well to describe adult film actress Stormy Daniels in a tweet as \u201cHorseface.\u201d \u201cFederal Judge throws out Stormy Danials lawsuit versus Trump. Trump is entitled to full legal fees.\u201d @FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas. She will confirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me, a total con! Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has directly insulted, attacked or otherwise maligned more than 100 individuals, according to our unscientific review of his feed. And that doesn\u2019t account for his broadsides against the FBI and other institutions in and outside of government. (Hat tip to this New York Times compendium, which traces back to before his candidacy.) The numbers can only tell us so much. As an example, of the roughly 82 men he\u2019s tweeted negatively about by name, 69 are white. More than a dozen are not. But that doesn\u2019t account for the three UCLA basketball players he criticized as not sufficiently grateful \u2013 \u201cI should have left them in jail!\u201d he tweeted \u2013 for his intervention following their arrest for shoplifting in China last year. Nor does it include the estimated 200 NFL players \u2013 almost all of them black \u2013 who have knelt or in some other way protested racial inequality and police brutality during the National Anthem and been assailed by the President for it. Trump has repeatedly attacked the protesters, accusing them, as he did in an October 2017 tweet, of \u201cshowing total disrespect to our Flag & Country.\u201d But the calculation plainly ran deeper than his stated reasoning. As he told Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, according to a deposition given by Jones and reported by the Wall Street Journal, \u201cThis is a very winning, strong issue for me.\u201d \u201cTell everybody,\u201d the President said, in an apparent reference to other owners and league officials, \u201cyou can\u2019t win this one. This one lifts me.\u201d By Trump\u2019s definition, whether it\u2019s the NFL or the investigations, and investigators, into Russian election interference, what \u201clifts\u201d him tends to be synonymous with what lays others low \u2013 especially if it\u2019s by his own hand, or tweeting digit(s). Of the 24 women he has gone after specifically, 17 are white and 12 were over 50 years of age at the time, according to our count. But his attacks on older women (by our arbitrary definition) and those of color have been memorably visceral. As an example, while Trump is fond of saying this or that person behaved in some way \u201clike a dog,\u201d since becoming President he has referred to only one person as a dog: Manigault Newman. (Trump called Arianna Huffington \u201ca dog who wrongfully comments on me\u201d a few months before beginning his 2016 campaign.) You can decide where his \u201cHorseface\u201d insult \u2013 directed against a woman \u2013 fits on the spectrum. In June 2017, Trump singled out then 50-year-old Mika Brzezinski, co-host of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d in a tweet disparaging her appearance and intellect: I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.. ...to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no! Trump has also used the \u201clow IQ\u201d insult against actor Robert De Niro and, a few weeks later, Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat who is black. More recently, he went after a pair of black men who have been critical, NBA star LeBron James and CNN anchor Don Lemon, saying that Lemon \u2013 whom he called \u201cthe dumbest man on television\u201d \u2013 made James \u201clook smart, which isn\u2019t easy to do.\u201d During his time on the job, the President has singled out on Twitter at least two corporate CEOs: Ken Frazier of the pharmaceutical giant Merck, who is black, and Disney\u2019s Bob Iger, who is white. No individual, however, has popped up more in Trump\u2019s feed than Hillary Clinton. And this count began after the 2016 election. Trump has used the phrase \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d more than 60 times since taking office. By comparison, \u201cFake News\u201d clocks in with 275 appearances and \u201cWitch Hunt\u201d at 127. Special counsel Robert Mueller, either directly or in reference to his team, has been named in around 43 tweets. (A second hat tip here to the Trump Twitter Archive.) Attacks on a pair of female figures, both with connections to men Trump has sought to discredit in relation to the Russia probe, have also brought attention to the way he addresses women \u2013 thinly cloaking his obvious contempt with loaded allusions to their appearances. The President has twice described former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who exchanged critical texts about Trump during the 2016 campaign with the since-fired FBI agent Peter Strzok, as \u201cthe lovely Lisa Page.\u201d The first such tweet came on August 1 and the second on August 11, the same day the President described Nellie Ohr, a former Fusion GPS contractor married to career Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, as his \u201cbeautiful wife.\u201d .....Will the FBI ever recover it\u2019s once stellar reputation, so badly damaged by Comey, McCabe, Peter S and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, and other top officials now dismissed or fired? So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers! Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was, along with Comey, McCabe, Strzok and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful! The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele\u2019s many meetings with Deputy A.G. Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly. It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC.... Before entering the White House, Trump tended to be more direct with his insults, as former Fox News host Megyn Kelly noted during the first Republican primary debate. Perhaps this is, after all, his version of \u201cpresidential.\u201d Or not. \u201cWhile I know it\u2019s \u2018not presidential\u2019 to take on a lowlife like Omarosa,\u201d he tweeted on August 13, \u201cand while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible. Sorry!\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "For two years Democrats have raged over Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, quarreled among themselves over the best strategy for responding to it, and above all, counted the days until next month\u2019s midterm election. The biggest political questions facing Democrats, needless to say, all remain to be decided on election night. But that doesn\u2019t mean the tempestuous 2018 campaign season hasn\u2019t already sent important signals \u2013 both encouraging and ominous \u2013 about the Democrats\u2019 future against a Republican Party that Trump is reshaping in his image. What follows is an attempt to identify some of the most important trends already evident on each side of that ledger for Democrats \u2013 along with a few critical questions that remain very much to be decided. There's a suburban tsunami driving 2018 1. The white-collar suburban discontent with Trump is real and widespread. The shift away from the GOP among white voters holding at least a four-year college degree is most intense among women, but also apparent among men. And those voters are retreating from the GOP not only along the East Coast (across Republican-held suburban seats in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Northern Virginia) and the West Coast (in a concentration of five GOP-held seats around Los Angeles and another near Seattle) but importantly also through the center of the country. There, Democrats are poised to capture suburban seats outside Minneapolis, Kansas City, Denver, Detroit, Chicago and Tucson; have toss up chances in other seats near Des Moines, Salt Lake City, Detroit and Chicago; and have solid, though more challenging opportunities in Houston and Dallas. (More on that below.) When the Washington Post/Schar School poll recently surveyed voters in 69 of the most competitive House districts they found that Democrats led among college-educated whites in them by fully 13 percentage points; by comparison, House Republicans carried those voters by nearly 20 point margins in both the 2010 and 2014 mid-terms, according to exit polls. Republicans respectively won control of the House and Senate in those midterms. 2. Democratic Senate and governor candidates in the Midwest are showing renewed competitiveness among blue-collar white voters who keyed Trump\u2019s victories in the states that propelled him into the White House. Democratic Senate incumbents in Ohio, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan \u2013 all states won by Trump \u2013 now appear solid favorites for re-election. The party is favored for the governorships in Michigan and Pennsylvania and locked in close races in Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa \u2013 the fifth Midwestern state key to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. And it could pick up as many as four House seats combined in Iowa and Michigan. In each case, that\u2019s at least partly because the Democratic nominees are posting much better numbers than Hillary Clinton among working-class white voters. Some of that may reflect what political professionals call \u201cdifferential turnout\u201d \u2013 meaning that the non-college whites who dislike Trump are more likely to show up than the working-class whites who surged to the polls for him in 2016, but aren\u2019t as enthusiastic about conventional Republican candidates. But Trump also appears to have suffered genuine erosion among working-class white women, largely because of his attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and a sense among many that the improved national economy hasn\u2019t provided them appreciably more security. If that crack in Trump\u2019s armor persists to 2020, it would arguably provide the single most important advance for Democrats in the midterm election. 3. In a party whose national leadership is conspicuously older and whiter than its younger and multi-racial voting base, Democrats may transform their roster of elected officials with an array of diverse young leaders. Educated white women were already recoiling from Trump. Then came Kavanaugh. They have chosen the most women ever as nominees in House, Senate and gubernatorial races; picked a wide array of talented young national security veterans (a striking number of them female as well) in House contests; selected African-American gubernatorial nominees in three states, Latino nominees in three more, as well as a native-American in Idaho; and nominated several openly gay, bisexual or trangender candidates in high profile statewide offices (including Krysten Sinema in the Arizona Senate race and Jared Polis in the Colorado governor\u2019s contest.) It\u2019s not hard to amass a list of Democratic House contenders who could graduate very quickly to future Senate nominations if they win next month: Mikie Sherrill in New Jersey, Conor Lamb in Pennsylvania, Jason Crow in Colorado, Dan McCready in North Carolina, Amy McGrath in Kentucky and Colin Allred in Texas among them. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will arrive in Congress from New York City an instant national figure among progressives. If Texas Senate challenger Beto O\u2019Rourke wins or even recovers from his current polling dip to finish close to Republican Ted Cruz, he could quickly become a serious presidential contender. Like the class of 1974 propelled into politics by the backlash against Richard Nixon and Watergate, the class of 2018 launched by the recoil from Trump could shape Democratic politics for years. \u201cThe 2018 [Democratic] class\u2026 will bring extraordinary number of national security experts into Congress at a time when America needs to reimagine its role in the world,\u201d says Simon Rosenberg, founder of the NDN, a Democratic advocacy and research group. \u201cIt is my bet that that the next \u2018John McCain\u2019 \u2013 a proud passionate patriot \u2014 will come from this class, and be a Democrat. \u201c 4. The party has built a powerful national small-donor fund-raising base. The vision of mass small contributor online fundraising earlier pursued in presidential races by Howard Dean, Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders has exploded from a niche opportunity to the default option for Democratic candidates this year. With the Democratic base\u2019s bottomless antipathy for Trump providing the fuel, mass donor fundraising is providing the party financial advantages that not long ago would have been unimaginable, especially when Democrats control none of Washington\u2019s power levers. The poster child for this revolution is O\u2019Rourke, who raised a head-spinning $38 million in just this year\u2019s third quarter. But more impressive may be the breadth of this financial river: the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says that in just that third quarter 30 Democratic House challengers raised at least $2 million, while another 30 raised at least $1 million. Those numbers are unprecedented and they suggest the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020 will have all the money he or she could possibly spend. 1. Trump \u2018s provocations alone show few signs of improving the subpar turnout patterns among Latinos and millennials, two core Democratic constituencies. Fear Factor: GOP hopes to convince voters that Democrats will sow chaos In polls, both groups express preponderant opposition to Trump\u2019s posture on cultural and racial issues. But most polls suggest that their turnout next month will plummet compared to 2016, just as it typically has in midterm elections. Compounding the problem, when Latino turnout sags, what\u2019s left in the voter pool tends to be older and more Republican. Democrats received encouraging news from Sunday\u2019s ABC/Washington Post poll, which found much higher levels of youth engagement than almost any other recent survey. But that result looks like an outlier compared to most other polls. And even if young people participate in somewhat higher numbers, their share of the vote could fall if they don\u2019t keep pace with the greater-than-usual midterm interest evident among other voter groups. By 2020, millennials will significantly exceed baby boomers as a share of eligible voters, but based on their turnout trajectory they will continue to lag them among actual voters. That would be a huge opportunity cost for Democrats given Trump\u2019s consistently low marks with the generation (apart from younger non-college whites). 2. White-collar suburbanites in the South still appear much more resistant to Democrats than elsewhere. \u201cThe electorates there are definitely more conservative,\u201d says Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. \u201cA Texas suburban voter is not the same thing as a New York suburban voter or a Denver suburban voter.\u201d A wide array of recent polls support that assessment. In Texas, O\u2019Rourke has shown clear gains among college-educated white voters compared to earlier statewide Democratic candidates, but in recent surveys he\u2019s stalled out at around 40% of them, too little to win. The New York Times/Siena College polls have found Democratic House candidates trailing among college-educated whites by about 20 points in two suburban North Carolina districts and by about 15 points in two suburban Texas districts. Stacey Abrams, the African-American Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia, has also shown little progress with those voters. The big exception is Andrew Gillum, the African-American gubernatorial nominee in Florida, who has run competitively with those voters in several surveys. But most of Florida more resembles the North in its cultural affinities; the larger trend is that ambivalence over Trump still doesn\u2019t appear to be moving a critical mass of Southern suburbanites, many of them culturally conservative Christians, away from the GOP. 3. Trump hasn\u2019t yet decisively tipped the Southwest toward the Democrats. Poll: Democrats have +11 advantage on choice for Congress As I\u2019ve written before, Democrats over the long run will likely need deeper inroads in the Southwest to offset what\u2019s likely to be slow erosion in Great Plains and maybe also Midwestern states dominated by the older and blue-collar white voters that now consistently favor the GOP (even if Democrats trim those margins this year in the Midwest). Many Democrats hoped \u2013 and Republicans feared \u2013 that Trump could drive away Southwestern states through his anti-immigrant agenda and a suspicion of free trade that plays better in the industrial Midwest than in Western states with less manufacturing and greater ties to Mexico and other global markets. But the key Southwestern states, while competitive, remain tough battles for Democrats. Democrats are favored in the governors\u2019 races in Colorado and New Mexico (more narrowly). But they are facing a dead-heat governor contest in Nevada and a likely landslide defeat against Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbot. In Arizona and Nevada, Democrats are struggling in the Senate races much more than many in the party hoped, or even expected. Meanwhile the latest polls have shown Cruz comfortably ahead of O\u2019Rourke, despite the Democrats\u2019 enormous crowds and fundraising. Apart from the Texas governor race, Democrats could still rescue any of these races. But their difficulty reflects the combined impact of the discouraging signs (1) and (2) just above: not enough Latino turnout (or margin) and insufficient inroads among white-collar suburban voters. Texas offers a variation on that equation tilted even more toward the GOP, largely because of point (4): 4. Outside of a few key Midwestern states, non-college whites in most places are still flocking to Trump and Republicans. That tilt is most evident in the South: In the latest Quinnipiac University Texas Poll, Cruz was not only winning an incredible 86% of non-college white men but also almost three-fourths of blue-collar white women. In the New York Times/Siena surveys, the Republican nominees were winning about three-fifths or more of those voters in all four North Carolina and Texas suburban districts it has polled. Looking more broadly, the Washington Post/Schar poll found Republicans leading among non-college whites by double digits across the 69 battleground House districts it surveyed. A Republican stronghold has become ground zero in 2018 The bright spot for Democrats \u2013 echoed in some, though not all, national polls \u2013 was that the party faced only a single-digit deficit in that survey among non-college white women, less than it has typically confronted in recent House elections. Still the bulk of the evidence suggests that apart from a few admittedly pivotal-Midwestern states with stronger traditions of class consciousness and deeper union roots, Democrats still face a tough climb to recapture many working-class whites from the Trump-era GOP. That means the party will likely struggle next month to extend its House gains much beyond the white-collar suburban seats inside the major metropolitan areas where Trump is most toxic. And that means to the recapture the House majority, Democrats probably can\u2019t leave many of those top-tier suburban opportunities on the table. In one sense, the answer, of course, is that everything is still To Be Determined: the election results could scramble any of the conclusions offered above. But some questions seem especially uncertain and fraught with implications for the Democrats future. 1. Does mobilization tip Florida, Georgia or Texas? Gillum, Abrams and O\u2019Rourke are road testing the strategy that many liberals prefer for the presidential race: placing the greatest priority on expanding the electorate by turning out more minority and young voters rather than focusing on reassuring ordinarily Republican-leaning whites disillusioned with Trump. If any of those three win, it will be a great boost for 2020 Democratic candidates whose principal strength is their potential to mobilize younger and non-white voters. Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, O\u2019Rourke himself, and \u2013 in a slightly different way \u2013 Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders could benefit. More centrist white men including Joe Biden, Michael Bloomberg, Terry McAuliffe and John Hickenlooper could face tougher questions about whether they offer Democrats the best path to victory. 2. If Democrats take the House, can they use the platform to soften up Trump for 2020 or can he effectively use them as a foil? The answer may turn at least partly on whether Democrats give him the contrast he\u2019s expecting, with a septuagenarian leadership headlined by Nancy Pelosi, 78. The alternative for Democrats is to make the same kind of generational change that Republicans did when they leapt from John Boehner (born in 1949) as speaker to Paul Ryan (born in 1970). But Democrats won\u2019t need to confront that choice unless they can fill in a \u201cyes\u201d on the biggest question of all in 2018: will they win back the House?",

            "article_content": "Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA test identifying her distant Native American ancestry is at its root a first stab at a question all 2020 Democratic hopefuls must answer: How do they run against a foe as menacing as Donald Trump? It is a mark of how the President has dragged campaign politics into a surreal era that what was seen as a de-facto declaration of a coming White House bid by a major rival involved an investigation into her own genetic make-up. The President has long mocked Warren for claiming she has a Native American connection and said he would love to confront her about it in a presidential debate. He showed Tuesday he is relishing an early 2020 showdown with Warren, lampooning her move in a withering tweet. \u201cPocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed. She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, \u2018DNA test is useless.\u2019 Even they don\u2019t want her. Phony!\u201d Trump tweeted, later calling on Warren to \u201capologize for perpetrating this fraud.\u201d In a video accompanying the results of her DNA testing, the Massachusetts Democrat said she is not enrolled in any tribe but that her \u201cfamily history is my family history. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about casual racism, war whoops, tomahawk chops \u2026 Trump can say whatever he wants about me, but mocking Native Americans, or any group, in order to get at me, that\u2019s not what America stands for,\u201d she said. In what could be a preview of things to come, the President immediately dismissed Warren\u2019s attempt to choose her own narrative. \u201cOne one-thousandth?\u201d Trump later asked reporters Monday, quickly spotting the most damaging potential of Warren\u2019s DNA result \u2013 the finding first reported by The Boston Globe that she is between 1/32 and 1/1024th Native American. Trump\u2019s mockery encapsulates the conundrum facing Democrats as the 2020 campaign kicks into gear, even before the 2018 midterm race wraps up in 21 days. As a supposedly golden generation of Republican candidates and Hillary Clinton discovered in 2016, Trump is dangerous because he lacks shame. There\u2019s no level to which he will not stoop for political gain. When truth and evidence \u2013 or a DNA test, branded \u201cjunk science\u201d by his counselor Kellyanne Conway on Monday \u2013 get in the way, he will pounce. Elizabeth Warren releases DNA test results By blasting Warren as \u201cPocahontas,\u201d Trump is emphasizing that he will use identity politics, racial slurs and political hiccups such as Warren\u2019s clumsy previous storytelling about her own upbringing in an effort to bring her down. He will do or say whatever it takes to win. As he told Lesley Stahl on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on Sunday when asked why he mocked Christine Blasey Ford, who accused new Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, we won.\u201d Warren released a sleek, nominating convention-style biographical video Monday, complete with her holding a beer and showing her in her native Oklahoma with her older brothers. It came across as an effort to prevent Trump from defining her and introducing herself to Americans on her own terms if she decides to run for president. Perhaps it will draw the sting from Trump\u2019s attacks, just as President Barack Obama sought to defuse the then real-estate magnate\u2019s claims he was born abroad by producing his Hawaii long-form birth certificate. But it probably won\u2019t. Trump, who craves enemies and invents them if they don\u2019t exist, is relishing Warren\u2019s decision to engage. If the facts don\u2019t favor him, he will just invent a more useful political reality. Warren's DNA never mattered to Trump Warren faced a difficult choice. She could have ignored Trump\u2019s taunts and stuck to her message about middle class pain in an economy rigged by the rich. But Trump was sure to come after her. The President has already seized on GOP claims that Warren used or lied about her Native American heritage to win benefits for minorities in her academic career \u2013 a charge her video says is false. The issue also hits a sweet spot for the President because it offers an opening to skewer Democrats for a perceived obsession with racial identity and minorities that plays well with Trump\u2019s white voting base. But by addressing her ancestry before a campaign, Warren is signaling she won\u2019t be \u201cswiftboated\u201d like another Massachusetts senator who ran for President, John Kerry, who never effectively stifled attacks on his Vietnam War record in 2004 by veterans supporting George W. Bush. Her move, which will give her a brief moment in the spotlight ahead of a bloated Democratic field, is also an early sign to party activists that if they chose her to take on Trump, she will not hold back. In fact, she was already trolling the President on Monday in a manner that seems to have got under his skin before. \u201cI took this test and released the results for anyone who cares to see because I\u2019ve got nothing to hide. What are YOU hiding, @realDonaldTrump? Release your tax returns \u2013 or the Democratic-led House will do it for you soon enough. Tick-tock, Mr President.\u201d Warren tweeted. I never expected my family\u2019s story to be used as a racist political joke, but I don\u2019t take any fight lying down. I want you to have the power to fight lies with the truth, so here's a new site for you to review every document for yourself. https://t.co/900SsAMNjb But there are potential risks to her strategy. By talking about the issue at all, she is allowing Trump to define the early campaign terrain \u2013 a technique he used to fell GOP primary candidates like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Chris Christie last time. Warren\u2019s gambit coincides with an intensifying debate among Democrats about the best way to confront Trump in 2020. Clinton said last week in an interview with CNN that you \u201ccannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about.\u201d The 2016 Democratic nominee was referring to the midterms, but she also effectively laid out a tonal pointer for 2020 Democratic candidates. But another former first lady, Michelle Obama, warned last week that fear is not a motivator, preferring the elevated politics of her husband, who sketched his own anti-Trump strategy in September. She said that her 2016 mantra, \u201cwhen they go low, we go high,\u201d still stands, even though its effectiveness was questionable two years ago. Obama was responding to former Attorney General Eric Holder, who may also mount a 2020 run, who said last week: \u201cWhen they go low, we kick \u2018em. That\u2019s what this new Democratic Party is about.\u201d There are other approaches that could work. By 2020, Americans might be tired of the crash-and-burn rhetoric and exhausting daily twists of life under Trump and could embrace a quieter, more conventional choice. Or maybe an issues-heavy campaign \u2013 by someone such as Bernie Sanders, bristling with liberal policy solutions on health care, inequality and the environmental movement could be a good fit for the times. But moderation may not tap furious energy raging through the Democratic grassroots ahead of the midterms. In a party electrified by opposition to Trump and embittered by losing a Supreme Court fight, there is plentiful fuel to feed a scorched earth campaign against the President. Still, no one can tell whether an all out negative assault can work against the master of \u201cgoing low,\u201d who stoked racial and societal divides to build a winning coalition from a fervent Republican base in 2016. It could also end up hurting challengers as much as it wounds Trump. After all, Republican foes such as Rubio saw their brands dinged by joining Trump in the gutter in a way that clashed with their more moderate political persona. An aide to Warren told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that the DNA test was part of an effort to release as much information as possible, including a decade of tax returns, and academic files as the senator weighs a 2020 run. She got a mixed reaction from Democratic political professionals. Jen Psaki, a former campaign aide and White House communications director for Obama, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that Warren\u2019s calculus was \u201csmart\u201d though probably would not work entirely because Trump would respond. \u201cShe is going to run for President clearly, she wants to clear the decks, she is going to do everything she can to do that \u2026 then she wants to move forward,\u201d Psaki said. One of Psaki\u2019s former colleagues, Jim Messina, who ran Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign, worried that Warren\u2019s timing was off. \u201cArgue the substance all you want, but why 22 days before a crucial election where we MUST win house and senate to save America, why did @SenWarren have to do her announcement now? Why can\u2019t Dems ever stay focused???\u201d Messina tweeted. Joe Trippi, who ran Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 Democratic presidential effort said Warren had actually waited too long. \u201cI would have done this a year or two ago \u2026 because they didn\u2019t do it, she had to (now),\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "When Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old black Florida high school student, was shot to death by a neighborhood watchman, African-Americans \u2013 voters, bloggers, columnists, lawmakers, activists and academics \u2013 wanted to hear from the nation\u2019s first black president. It took President Barack Obama, who was running for re-election at the time, about a month to finally weigh in. And when he did, his comments reflected his reticence to weigh in on an active investigation, but also his caution on matters of race. \u201cMy main message is to the parents of Trayvon. You know, if I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon,\u201d Obama said, in his only reference at the time to the racial dynamics of the killing. \u201cAll of us as Americans are going to take this with the seriousness it deserves.\u201d Obama\u2019s approach to race, at least as he was campaigning for white support, was predictable for much of his two terms \u2013 tread lightly or, if possible, say nothing at all, to maintain the illusion of post-racial politics. (The furor touched off by Obama\u2019s comment that Cambridge police \u201cacted stupidly\u201d in arresting a black Harvard professor at his home was a defining and instructive moment. Polls suggest his white support took a dip and never fully recovered in the summer of 2009.) Obama\u2019s 2008 race speech was imbued with both-siderism. And his lectures to black audiences about their behavior assured whites that he wouldn\u2019t be captive to African-Americans as the first black president but instead would take a \u201ctough love\u201d approach. But in 2018, the three African-American Democrats running for governor represent something of an evolution from Obama on matters of race. The candidates \u2013 Georgia\u2019s Stacey Abrams, Florida\u2019s Andrew Gillum and Maryland\u2019s Ben Jealous \u2013 speak to this post-Obama shift, which has been defined by the raw racial politics of Trumpism and the Black Lives Matter agenda. Trump reportedly referred to African nations as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d He suggested a moral equivalence between white supremacists and people protesting against white supremacists. And he has called NFL players protesting against police brutality \u201csons of bitches.\u201d  In short, he has been a master of white identity politics, stoking white grievance by suggesting that his white base is under siege. \u201cYou can\u2019t talk about people getting shot by cops and not talk about race. You can\u2019t talk about the President\u2019s comments and be kumbaya and expect people to take you seriously,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, an Emory University professor who has an upcoming book on Obama and what political scientists call \u201cderacialization.\u201d \u201cThis moment calls for a different approach. They have the same challenge of Obama, though, to prove that they are running to govern everybody and not just the black community,\u201d she said. This new era hints at a post-post-racial era of American politics. Black politicians, courting white voters, are engaging in conversations about racism in a way that seemed politically perilous just a decade ago. Even as they take a somewhat bolder approach than Obama, all three black gubernatorial candidates are careful to say America\u2019s first black president faced different challenges that made his approach to race more complicated. On the stump in Florida, Tallahassee Mayor Gillum often turns to the story of Markeis McGlockton, who was shot and killed by a white man during an encounter over a handicap parking spot at a Florida convenience store. But in his telling, Gillum, who says he would repeal the \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d law if he becomes governor, likes to make the listener do some work, reversing the racial roles in the McGlockton killing. What if a black man were yelling at a white woman sitting in the car with her two kids as her white partner went into the store? What if the black man then shot the white man who confronted him over yelling at his wife and kids? \u201cCould you imagine, just for a moment, if the shoes had been reversed?\u201d he asked his audience a few weeks ago, as part of a Congressional Black Caucus panel featuring black gubernatorial candidates. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to be sensational about this, I\u2019m just trying to speak the truth. We all know that race still matters in this society.\u201d The idea of \u201ckeeping it real\u201d on race was echoed by Abrams, who\u2019s running at the top of the statewide ticket in Georgia. Often, that authenticity relies on biography. At a recent rally in Clayton County, Abrams framed her stump speech with her experiences as a Spelman College student after the 1992 Rodney King verdict, where protests broke out across black America. The Atlanta power structure saw the protesters as \u201cbad black people,\u201d she said. She ended her standard stump speech, to a diverse audience, with a story from her teenage years, when, as valedictorian of her high school, her trip to the governor\u2019s mansion hit a snag. \u201cWe walked up to the guard. He said, \u2018This is a private event. You don\u2019t belong here,\u2019 \u201d she recalled, telling a story she tells at almost every stop. The guard, she said, looked at the public bus her family traveled in \u201cwith a sneer.\u201d Eventually the guard let her family in. The point of the campaign trail story \u2013 which nods to race and class \u2013 is that Abrams belonged in the governor\u2019s mansion as a teenager to celebrate her academic achievements and she belongs there now. \u201cPart of the responsibility is to have honest and authentic conversations about race,\u201d Abrams told CNN in an interview. \u201cWhat we have to talk about is how race intersects with power. And my mission is to demonstrate that we can change the face of power, evolve it to include more people and people of different complexions and different backgrounds without diminishing anyone else\u2019s access to opportunity. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do that when you ignore that race is part of the conversation.\u201d Jealous, a former president of the NAACP, is running for governor in Maryland. \u201cI\u2019m a black civil rights leader who has a white dad and a black son, so when I look at the issue of handguns, I\u2019m urgently aware that black boys like my son are at extreme risk of homicide,\u201d he told CNN in an interview. \u201cI have black cousins who have been shot in the last 10 years, and a white cousin who is in rehab. I am running with these labels.\u201d While he is trailing in polls against Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, Jealous said he is \u201cclear with folks that racism is a tool of wealthy special interests.\u201d \u201cThe end effect of racism is we all lose,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump may have never had a better time being President. Only a re-election party on the night of November 3, 2020, could possibly offer the same vindication for America\u2019s most unconventional commander in chief as the 36 hours in which two foundational strands of his political career are combining in a sudden burst of history. Trump became an undeniably consequential President when Senate voted Saturday to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, consecrating the conservative majority that has long been the impossible dream of the GOP. On Friday, Trump had celebrated the best jobs data for 49 years as the unemployment rate dipped to 3.7%, offering more proof of a vibrant economy that the President says has been unshackled by his tax-reduction program and scything cuts to business regulations. While his 2016 election campaign was most notable for swirling chaos and shattered norms, Trump\u2019s vows to nominate conservative judges to the Supreme Court and to fire up the economy were the glue for his winning coalition. The struggle to confirm Kavanaugh split the country, deepened mistrust festering between rival lawmakers and threatens to further drag the Supreme Court into Washington\u2019s poisoned political stew. But Trump stuck with it and ground out a win. So he has every right to return to voters in the next four weeks ahead of the midterm elections to argue he has done exactly what he said he would do. He now has a strong message to convince grass-roots Republicans that it\u2019s well worth showing up at the polls. He got his first chance to road-test his new, improved message at a campaign rally in Topeka, Kansas, on Saturday night. It\u2019s ironic that it was Trump, a late convert to conservatism \u2013 not authentic Republicans like President Ronald Reagan, both Bush presidents and beaten GOP nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain \u2013 who finally delivered the Supreme Court majority. Kavanaugh is Trump\u2019s second nominee to reach the court in less than two years, following Neil Gorsuch. Of course, the Supreme Court win is the culmination of decades of work by conservative activists and was masterminded by the cunning of Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell. But Presidents get credit when they are in the Oval Office when things go well and Trump, whether it is his fault or not, has taken more than his share of criticism. On Saturday morning, Trump celebrated the imminent vote, praising pro-Kavanaugh women activists while again jabbing protesters opposed to the judge, many of whom said they had their own stories of assaults. His attitude reflected what critics say is a habit of siding with the accused rather than the alleged victims of assaults. \u201cWomen for Kavanaugh, and many others who support this very good man, are gathering all over Capitol Hill in preparation for a 3-5 P.M. VOTE. It is a beautiful thing to see - and they are not paid professional protesters who are handed expensive signs. Big day for America!\u201d Trump wrote. The President\u2019s remarks came as people gathered outside the US Supreme Court building to protest the vote. There is more evidence than the soon-to-be reshaped Supreme Court and the roaring economy to make a case that Trump is building a substantial presidency that in many ways looks like a historic pivot point, despite its extremely controversial nature. Largely unnoticed in the Washington imbroglio over sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh, the Trump administration is engineering significant changes at home and abroad that often represent sharp revisions of direction from traditional American positions. This week, for instance, the White House initiated a potentially momentous shift in the US approach to China, recognizing the Asian giant as a global competitor and a threat to American security, prosperity and interests \u2013 reversing decades of policy designed to manage Beijing\u2019s ascent as a major power and eventual partner. The administration is also tightening a vise around Iran in a strategy that threatens to escalate into open confrontation with the Islamic Republic. Elsewhere in the Middle East, a bolstered anti-ISIS strategy has blasted the radical group from its strongholds in shattered Syria. And Trump has rejected decades of US orthodoxy in managing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which could have uncertain results. Trump\u2019s bullying approach to trade negotiations has recently yielded remodeled agreements with Canada, Mexico and South Korea. While he exaggerates how much he changed existing deals, he can still boast that his \u201cArt of the Deal\u201d negotiating strategy \u2013 another core component of his appeal to his supporters \u2013 is working. An announcement of a deeper slashing of refugee admissions by the United States further cements the \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy that has changed global strategic assumptions. At home, Trump\u2019s assault on regulations at agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency is accelerating, in a blitz against what Steve Bannon once called the administrative state that fulfills another long-dreamed-of goal of the conservative movement. Many of Trump\u2019s perceived achievements are hugely controversial, and his opponents will argue that they stain America\u2019s image, reverse a march toward human progress and justice, and will ultimately exert a price the nation will be paying for many years to come. And Democrats carp that Trump is only building off the far more significant economic work of his predecessor Barack Obama in the wake of the Great Recession and argue that his tax cuts sharply worsened inequality and exploded budget deficits in a way that will haunt the economy for decades. Trump\u2019s critics say his approach to the world threatens to buckle the international system of alliances and a rule-based trading system that made America the richest and most powerful nation in US history and a beacon of democracy. They say his presidency is in fact most notable for a culture of corruption, falsehood and demagoguery. There is a case to be made that Trump\u2019s constant twisting of truth, invention of false political realities and strategy of tearing at the country\u2019s racial, gender and societal divides in order to capture and wield power threaten the eternal values and institutions of the nation itself. This week, the President stood accused of tax fraud after a New York Times investigation into his family finances in the 1990s. And, though special counsel Robert Mueller has gone quiet in election season, Trump\u2019s campaign is under investigation to see whether it conspired with a foreign power to win his election. Most credible pollsters have the President at only around 40% approval, a level that is rarely conducive to successful congressional elections. Republicans are in danger of losing the House of Representatives, a scenario that could cripple Trump\u2019s White House with relentless committee investigations and even the specter of impeachment. Often the chaos and discord the President sows distracts from more successful aspects of his presidency, and his raging temperament and insistence on waging perpetual political warfare exhaust many voters. It will be up to voters in November and in 2020 to decide which of the two interpretations of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 an era of conservative achievement or a disastrous national distraction \u2013 becomes dominant. But it already seems that Trump\u2019s grand design will be difficult for a future President to quickly reverse. Less than two weeks ago, foreign diplomats at the United Nations laughed at Trump when he boasted about the historic sweep of his presidency \u2013 and there was no doubt that he was, as usual, exaggerating. But it\u2019s also no longer possible to credibly argue \u2013 despite the distracting blizzard of controversy, busted decorum and staff chaos constantly lashing Washington \u2013 that there is not something significant taking place that is changing the political and economic character of the nation itself.",

            "article_content": "If Brett Kavanaugh is confirmed to the Supreme Court, the question that would hang over him, based on all he has been through and all he has said, is: Can he be fair? Kavanaugh nomination: Murkowski no, Flake yes for Saturday's final vote Retired Justice John Paul Stevens, prominent law professors, attorneys and lawmakers have all raised that question as senators prepare to vote on his nomination Saturday. Stevens told a Florida audience that there was \u201cmerit\u201d to the criticism that Kavanaugh has \u201cdemonstrated a potential bias involving enough potential litigants before the court that he would not be able to perform his full responsibilities.\u201d Kavanaugh, a 12-year veteran of an influential US appeals court in Washington, told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that the sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford arose from \u201ca calculated and orchestrated political hit, fueled with apparent pent-up anger about President Trump and the 2016 election \u2026 revenge on behalf of the Clintons and millions of dollars in money from outside left-wing opposition groups.\u201d The former aide to President George W. Bush who also served with independent counsel Ken Starr\u2019s investigation of President Bill Clinton, also declared, \u201cAs we all know, in the United States political system of the early 2000s, what goes around comes around.\u201d Ginsburg laments modern-day contentious confirmation hearings Even from the start, President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Kavanaugh was incendiary. The atmosphere in the nation\u2019s capital and throughout the country is far more partisan than in earlier decades, and Kavanaugh would succeed centrist conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who held the key vote on the nine-member bench for abortion rights and gay marriage, to name just two of the many social policy issues Kennedy controlled. Ginsburg laments modern-day contentious confirmation hearings Kavanaugh\u2019s partisan outbursts, suggesting he would not be a neutral arbiter, also may have reinforced public perceptions that the ideologically divided justices cast their votes based on political allegiances. Chief Justice John Roberts, also appointed by a Republican president, has previously expressed concerns that the public believes any nominee who emerges from a politically divisive confirmation process necessarily would be political. On Thursday night, Kavanaugh published an essay in the Wall Street Journal acknowledging he may have gone too far. \u201cI was very emotional last Thursday, more so than I have ever been. I might have been too emotional at times. I know that my tone was sharp, and I said a few things I should not have said,\u201d he wrote. Suspicions of impartiality are not new, but the nature of the accusations and Kavanaugh\u2019s angry, partisan response put this episode in a category of its own. Other Supreme Court nominees \u2013 in recent decades William Rehnquist and Clarence Thomas \u2013 faced accusations, questions of veracity, and claims they would not be impartial jurists. Both were confirmed (Rehnquist as an associate justice in late 1971 and as chief justice in 1986) and Thomas (as an associate justice in 1991), but controversy over their nominations faded but never fully disappeared. 6 Supreme Court nominees who faced controversy Questions of judicial fairness arise in two ways: broadly regarding a jurist\u2019s temperament, as is in the current dispute, and specifically on cases that come before the nine. Regarding the latter, federal law says that any judge must disqualify himself or herself in any proceeding in which his or her \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d The Supreme Court is not covered by that mandate, as are lower court judges, but the individual justices have said they abide by it. Protestors storm Capitol Hill after Senate vote to advance Kavanaugh confirmation Rarely, however, do they recuse themselves from cases. They pull out, typically, if they have a clear financial interest, for example, with stock in a company that has been sued, or if they previously handled the case as a lawyer or lower court judge. It is exceedingly rare that a justice decides not to participate based on a substantive view on the issue. New York University Law Professor Stephen Gillers, who specializes in legal ethics, said \u201cthe bar is very high\u201d for motions that a jurist recuse himself or herself. He said case precedent requires specific evidence of bias for a specific situation. Gillers said it was unlikely that Kavanaugh, if he were confirmed, would receive many motions from litigants for recusal. Yet, he said that would not be the end of the matter in the public eye. \u201cThe fact that he\u2019s not going to be recused in politically sensitive cases doesn\u2019t mean that the losers in those cases will not believe that he was biased against them, Gillers said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of disconnect between the high bar of recusal and what the public believes\u201d of a judge\u2019s prejudices and preconceptions. An empty space and an idle microphone: The Supreme Court returns More than 2,400 law professors from more than 190 schools delivered a letter on Thursday to the Senate questioning Kavanaugh\u2019s judicial temperament, based on his testimony in the second round of Senate hearings, when Kavanaugh defended himself against claims that he assaulted Ford when they were teenagers in Maryland. Even before that, some legal scholars asserted Kavanaugh would have to step aside in cases involving presidential power, based on Kavanaugh\u2019s prior statements in the area. Stevens, nominated by Republican Gerald Ford and who served 1975-2010, drew a line between Thomas\u2019 statements and Kavanaugh\u2019s, concluding that, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing that Clarence did in the hearings that disqualified him from sitting in cases after he came on the court.\u201d Thomas, who also served on the DC Circuit where Kavanaugh now sits, was accused of sexual harassment by Anita Hill, with whom he had worked at the Department of Education and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. He had been nominated to succeed liberal legend Thurgood Marshall, the nation\u2019s first African-American justice. \u201cThis is a circus,\u201d Thomas said at a 1991 hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cIt is a national disgrace. And from my standpoint as a black American \u2026 it is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks who in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas.\u201d After Thomas was confirmed, lawyers did not regularly seek to remove from cases. He has been broadly regarded as a hard-right jurist who, even if bitter over the Hill claims, votes based on his ideology not on payback. During Rehnquist\u2019s 1971 hearings to be an associate justice and then in 1986 to be chief justice, Rehnquist was accused of numerous incidents of racial bias, including of intimidating black voters at the polls in the 1960s when he was a lawyer in Phoenix. Rehnquist denied the allegations. 6 Supreme Court nominees who faced controversy Among the witnesses who testified against Rehnquist in 1986 about alleged poll-watching activities in Arizona was James Brosnahan, a former assistant US attorney who had been investigating voter complaints. Rehnquist was confirmed for elevation to chief, and afterward, he recused himself from Brosnahan\u2019s cases.",

            "article_content": "Even before Christine Blasey Ford delivered her controlled but explosive testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, college-educated white women like her represented a rising threat to Republican prospects in the November election. But Ford\u2019s detailed allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh could allow Democrats to solidify an unprecedented advantage among those women, who represent one of the few steadily growing components of the white electorate. Coming even as many professional white women are already recoiling from President Donald Trump\u2019s definition of the Republican Party, and Democrats have nominated an unprecedented number of professional women for Congress, the collision between Kavanaugh and Ford \u2013 a professional herself \u2013 has the potential to reinforce a lasting shift in loyalties that could tip the partisan balance in white-collar suburbs around America. \u201cCollege-educated white women have identified very strongly with Dr. Ford and relate to her as a person, and will be turned off by the angry diatribes of Brett Kavanaugh,\u201d says Democratic pollster Ben Tulchin. \u201cThis dynamic will likely further boost college-educated women\u2019s engagement in this election.\u201d New polling released Monday showed how the confrontation over Ford\u2019s allegations could reinforce these dynamics. A national Quinnipiac University survey found that 61% of college-educated white women said they believed Ford over Kavanaugh; 58% of such well-educated women said the Senate should reject his nomination, according to detailed results provided by Quinnipiac. By contrast, just over half of white women without degrees said they believed Kavanaugh and the Senate should confirm him. There's a suburban tsunami driving 2018 That divergence is a reminder that for all the talk about an undifferentiated gender gap, a key political dynamic of the Trump era has been a widening \u201cclass gap\u201d between white women with and without college degrees. In 2016, exit polls found that Hillary Clinton carried 51% of white women with at least four-year college degrees, compared with 44% for Trump. But Trump carried a commanding 61% among white women without college degrees, and widespread support among those women was key to his victories in the Rust Belt states that decided the election. The 17-percentage-point gap between Trump\u2019s support among blue- and white-collar white women in the exit poll was by far the widest divergence for any candidate since 1980. In a recent paper, political scientists Erin Cassese of the University of Delaware and Tiffany Barnes of the University of Kentucky found that attitudes among white women about the prevalence of sexual discrimination predicted support in the 2016 election far more than in the past. Barnes and Cassese, using data from the University of Michigan\u2019s American National Election Studies poll, found that white women with college degrees were much more likely than white women without degrees to say that females faced discrimination in society. What\u2019s more, they found those attitudes more strongly correlated with support in the 2016 presidential race than in 2012, with female voters who believed that women faced discrimination tilting toward Clinton and those who did not leaning toward Trump. In an interview on Monday, Barnes said that one reason college-educated white women are more likely to perceive discrimination is because they are more exposed than blue-collar women to occupations and workplaces where they are competing with men. Women without college degrees, she notes, often \u201ctend to get tracked into gender-segregated labor markets\u201d such as home health care, where they are performing jobs held primarily by women and thus competing mostly against other women for advancement. By contrast, she says, college-educated women are often competing directly against men. \u201cWhen women and men are tracked into similar careers \u2026 that\u2019s when it becomes a little more evident the role that discrimination plays in the economy and in people\u2019s career opportunities,\u201d she says. Trump himself raised the salience of those views, Barnes believes, because he faced such widespread allegations of sexual harassment and misbehavior, including from his own words in the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. Just as Trump\u2019s open appeals to white racial anxieties raised the importance of racial attitudes in predicting support in the election, so too did the controversies surrounding his behavior toward women increase the electoral relevance of views about women\u2019s place in society and traditional gender roles. \u201cVoters were never asked to weigh in on these issues before,\u201d said Barnes. The GOP is right to be worried about Kavanaugh The collision between Ford and Kavanaugh could not be more perfectly designed to rekindle all these controversies. Ford is the embodiment of the professional white woman: She\u2019s a professor with three graduate degrees who slipped easily into scientific jargon to describe the biology of memory functions. In her testimony before the committee, she was calm, even-tempered and at times deferential. Kavanaugh, by contrast, was bristling and belligerent, as were several of the Republican senators on the committee, all of whom are men. In one of the hearing\u2019s iconic moments, Kavanaugh fiercely attacked a female Democratic senator, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who responded not with outrage of her own, but with a calm, if astonished, demeanor. As many commentators have written, a female witness who displayed the same emotions might have been described as hysterical; Kavanaugh\u2019s supporters defended him as understandably impassioned and indignant. Many professional women may have seen their own workplace experiences reflected not only in the nature of Ford\u2019s allegations but also in the stark contrast between how a man and woman in conflict were expected, or even allowed, to behave. In the Quinnipiac survey released Monday, nearly three-fourths of college-educated white women (compared with only about half of those without degrees) said they viewed Ford as honest. Some conservatives have tried to minimize the risk the party faces this year among professional white women by suggesting they are already a lost cause. Steve Bannon, formerly Trump\u2019s chief strategist, recently took that route. \u201cThe Republican college-educated woman is done,\u201d he told Vanity Fair. \u201cThey\u2019re gone. They were going anyway at some point in time. Trump triggers them.\u201d But in fact, Republicans have remained highly competitive among college-educated white women, even as those women have usually leaned slightly toward Democrats. Clinton, as noted above, carried them by only 7 percentage points in 2016. The most any Democratic presidential nominee has carried among them since 1980 is 52%, for both Al Gore in 2000 and Barack Obama in 2008. Likewise, the best recent showing among Democrats in House races among college-educated white women was also 52% in both 2000, with Gore, and 2006, when Democrats took control of the House majority. In the 2010 and 2014 Republican congressional sweeps, Democrats ran well below 50% with these women in House races; even in 2016, Democratic House candidates carried only half of them. Over the past several months, polls consistently have shown Democrats on track to amass much wider \u2013 and even unprecedented \u2013 margins with those women in 2018. The latest CNN and USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times polls each showed Democrats capturing an astounding 67% of college-educated white women, while the Pew Research Center\u2019s most recent survey put their support at 63%. The latest Fox News and NBC/Wall Street Journal polls showed Democrats drawing just below three-fifths of these women. By contrast, each of those surveys found Democrats still trailing, in most cases by double-digit margins, among white women without college degrees. A Republican stronghold has become ground zero in 2018 Just as important, a procession of recent state polls have found the Democrats\u2019 advantage among college-educated white women persisting in every region of the country, not just in liberal states along the coasts. The most recent CNN surveys showed Democrats Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona and Phil Bredesen in Tennessee each carrying almost three-fifths of them. Recent NBC/Marist surveys have found Democrats Sherrod Brown winning about two-thirds of these women in the Ohio Senate race and Andrew Gillum capturing nearly three-fifths of them in the Florida governor\u2019s race. The most recent Marquette University Law School survey in Wisconsin found Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin winning about two-thirds of them in the Senate race and over three-fifths backing Democrat Tony Evers in the governor\u2019s contest. Even in heartland states steadily shifting toward the GOP, NBC/Marist polls found Democratic Sens. Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Joe Donnelly in Indiana attracting support from a majority of these women. This consistent shift toward Democrats among well-educated white women is driven mostly by their recoil from Trump. The latest CNN surveys put Trump\u2019s disapproval among college-educated white women at 72% and found that more than three-fifths of them disapproved of him in both Arizona and Tennessee, two states that he carried. Earlier this year a Quinnipiac University survey found that a remarkable three-fourths of those well-educated white women said Trump did not respect women as much as men. (That was 20 percentage points higher than the share of non-college white women who felt that way.) In another Quinnipiac survey last summer, nearly three-fifths of college white women said they considered Trump a racist (while non-college white women split evenly on the question). Longtime Democratic strategist Stanley B. Greenberg notes that Democrats are also recording some improvement in polls for November among blue-collar white women relative to their weak showings in recent elections and are seeing more substantial gains among college-educated white men, usually a very Republican-leaning constituency. \u201cClearly college-educated women are leading it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just suburban moms or women, it\u2019s the men too that are put off by what Trump is offering. It\u2019s the women more so, but there\u2019s a class polarization as well as gender polarization.\u201d Still, the shift among well-educated white men seems less uniform or reliable for Democrats than the change among their female counterparts. All the recent national polls on preferences in November do show Democrats leading among those well-educated white men, except for the most recent Fox News survey. But in the state polls the results are more uneven: The Democrat leads among those men in the recent CNN Arizona Senate poll, but trails badly with them in Tennessee. In the NBC/Marist polls, Democrats led slightly among them in the Ohio Senate race, but trailed in Missouri and Florida. The Marquette poll found those voters splitting evenly in the Wisconsin Senate race and tilting narrowly toward Democrat Evers in the governor\u2019s contest. Why red and blue states divide over green policy And the confrontation over Ford and Kavanaugh hasn\u2019t produced nearly as decisive a verdict among college white men as women: In Monday\u2019s Quinnipiac survey, slightly more of those men said they believed Ford than Kavanaugh. But still, by 48% to 45%, a plurality of them said they supported Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. (Not surprisingly, the whites who most backed Kavanaugh were men without a college education, Trump\u2019s strongest group: Just under two-thirds of them in the Quinnipiac Poll said they believed Kavanaugh and he should be confirmed.) All this suggests that in the crucible of the Trump era, Democrats have a unique opportunity to lock in unprecedented advantages among well-educated white women. If they can do so, that investment could pay compounding returns. Women receive almost three-fifths of all the undergraduate and graduate degrees obtained by whites, federal statistics show. As a result, college-educated white women have increased their share of the white electorate in recent years. Exit polls showed them rising to one-fifth of all voters in 2016, while other analyses, like the nonpartisan States of Change project, put their share slightly lower, at about 1 in 6. Virtually all forecasts project they will constitute an increasing share of the white electorate in the years ahead, while non-college whites, Trump\u2019s base, will decline as the electorate diversifies. Rob Griffin, a principal researcher on the States of Change project, forecasts that college-educated women will reach about one-fourth of the white electorate by 2036, up from just over one-fifth now. As Greenberg argues, the impact of shifting loyalties among well-educated white women will be magnified if the changes evident in some areas among well-educated men also persist through 2020 and beyond. But for 2018, there\u2019s no question that the recoil from Trump among white-collar white women has emerged as the single most powerful force propelling Democratic opportunities. And coming after all those hostile judgments about Trump have already collected among well-educated white women, the Senate\u2019s impending decision on Kavanaugh may operate like a match dropped into a pool of gasoline.",

            "article_content": "New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo easily defeated a challenge from his left by progressive activist and actress Cynthia Nixon to win the Democratic nomination for a third term Thursday night. RELATED: CNN Poll: Democrats\u2019 midterm advantage holds among likely voters The Empire State primary marked the final opportunity this year for left-wing insurgents to unseat powerful Democratic incumbents. But Cuomo, a battle-tested campaigner with deep pockets, consolidated establishment support in the spring and spent the summer blitzing the airwaves, spending more than $8 million over three weeks late in the contest to head off any momentum growing around Nixon\u2019s bid. CNN Poll: Democrats' midterm advantage holds among likely voters The \u201cSex and the City\u201d star\u2019s decision to run was met with a hard line of resistance from top party officials inside the state and nationally, who backed Cuomo as both a liberal champion and the best positioned candidate to stand as a bulwark against the Trump administration and an increasingly conservative Supreme Court. RELATED: There\u2019s a new No. 1 among 2020 Democrats Pushing for universal rent control, single-payer health care, new funding for public schools and a large-scale renewal of New York City\u2019s broken-down subway system, which is controlled by the state, Nixon spent much of the spring and summer relentlessly attacking Cuomo and his political agenda as insufficiently ambitious for one of the country\u2019s bluest states. New York City Public Advocate Tish James, who was endorsed by Cuomo, will be the party\u2019s nominee for attorney general and, if she wins in November, the first black woman elected to statewide office. Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul will hold off New York City councilman Jumaane Williams, Nixon\u2019s running mate. On Thursday night, after months of campaigning, Nixon touted down ballot victories for progressive allies and called her own bid, which offered a rare rebuke to Cuomo, a victory in itself. \u201cWe have fundamentally changed the political landscape in this state,\u201d she told supporters gathered at Brooklyn\u2019s Omar Cafe. \u201cWe have changed what is expected of a Democratic candidate running in New York and what we can demand from our elected leaders. Progressive rhetoric alone is not enough \u2013 people are struggling just to survive here, and they need to see real substantive policies that address racial, gender and economic inequality.\u201d New York progressives have for years blamed Cuomo for the state\u2019s failure to pass its own DREAM Act, legislation to protect abortion rights and serious campaign finance revisions. And while they credit his successful push to legalize same-sex marriage in 2011, years before most other states took the step, his critics also point to it as evidence that he is not committed to delivering on other liberal priorities. There's a new No. 1 among 2020 Democrats On the trail last weekend, Cuomo veered strategically between listing his achievements and railing against Trump. \u201cThe President says, \u2018I\u2019m fighting with Gov. Cuomo but it\u2019s just Gov. Cuomo that I\u2019m fighting with, just Gov. Cuomo \u2013 everybody else agrees with me,\u2019\u201d Cuomo said at a rally on Long Island, rehashing his recent Twitter dust-up with Trump before framing the ask: \u201cI want you to come out Thursday and vote for me. And I want, when you fill in that little hole there on that little ballot, I want you to be saying, \u2018No, President Trump, it\u2019s not just Andrew who disagrees with you. Every decent New Yorker disagrees with you.\u2019 \u201c Cuomo will face Republican Marc Molinaro in the November general election. Throughout the campaign, Cuomo mostly left the work of chopping away at Nixon to campaign aides and supporters. Live-tweeting through the primary\u2019s only debate, in late August, Cuomo staffers called Nixon \u201cunhinged\u201d while the governor, onstage, fought to keep his cool. Last weekend, he publicly distanced himself from the printing and distribution of a mailer, sent to Jewish voters by the state party, that falsely accused Nixon of being \u201csilent on the rise of anti-Semitism.\u201d Nixon\u2019s campaign, which operated as the tip of a spear of a slate of progressive challengers down the ballot, alternated between searing criticism of Cuomo directly and broader objections to a state government they view as grotesquely transactional. CNN Key Race Alert: This is the narrow path to a Democratic Senate The battle lines were drawn early on, when within weeks of Nixon\u2019s entering the race in March, she secured the backing of the New York-based progressive Working Families Party, a process that led to a rift within that party that its leaders blamed on Cuomo. From April on, the New York Democratic establishment and its progressive insurgency would wage one of the primary season\u2019s hottest conflicts. Groups like Indivisible and local Democratic Socialists of America chapters eventually lined up with Nixon while organized labor, the state party Cuomo effectively controls and most of New York\u2019s top elected officials \u2013 along with Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 backed the governor, who also secured a lukewarm endorsement from the New York Times editorial board. Obama to unveil 'pointed' midterm message For all the respect and support her campaign has amassed on the left, Nixon never trailed Cuomo in public polling by less than 20 percentage points. Cuomo\u2019s lead grew over the summer as his campaign unleashed a torrent of television ads \u2013 including one that aired right before the debate \u2013 that often featured Biden\u2019s kind words. Nixon, who was outspent at a nearly 20-to-1 clip, mostly directed her limited resources to digital efforts and field work. Cuomo supporters, like Stu Loeser, the longtime former spokesman for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, said the governor\u2019s advantage heading into primary went beyond the gulf in spending \u2013 and pointed to a misreading of the electorate by Cuomo\u2019s Democratic opponents. \u201cProgressives say all decisions should be made purely on the merits and that\u2019s why we should be pursuing affordable housing and everything else,\u201d Loeser said. \u201cAnd there are a lot of people out there who think, \u2018We lose every time that happens. And this guy is concerned about us.\u2019\u201d The stakes of the primary escalated further in May, when then-state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman resigned after multiple women alleged, in a New Yorker report, that he had assaulted them. Suddenly, one of the most powerful statewide jobs in the country \u2013 and a launching pad to higher office \u2013 was up for grabs. The Cuomo-backed James, who is expected to also receive the Working Families Party ballot line, defeated a strong field including Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney and progressive favorite Zephyr Teachout, the anti-corruption activist who campaigned alongside Nixon for much of the primary. The result could have an outsize effect on national politics, depending on how aggressively James sees fit to oversee Trump, his administration and financial titans on Wall Street. Teachout and Williams had, along with Nixon, come together to form a de facto progressive ticket, one that extended into the handful of state Senate races where grass-roots-powered primary challengers \u2013 a mostly young, diverse group seeking to oust entrenched incumbents \u2013 pledged to unlock the seemingly impenetrable maneuvering that steers Albany, the state\u2019s corruption-plagued capital. \u201cThere is a movement happening,\u201d Nixon senior adviser Rebecca Katz said earlier in the week. \u201cIt began with (Alexandria) Ocasio-Cortez and we\u2019ve cross-endorsed state Senate candidates, we\u2019ve cross-endorsed other challengers, Zephyr, Jumaane \u2013 it\u2019s a different feel because we\u2019re all in this together. That will be a lasting thing.\u201d Even with Nixon\u2019s loss, progressives on Thursday scored significant victories in their push to empower their agenda in Albany \u2013 and in the process fundamentally shift the state\u2019s politics. In the 34th state Senate district, Alessandra Biaggi, a former Hillary Clinton campaign aide and lawyer in Cuomo\u2019s counsel\u2019s office, declared victory over Jeff Klein, the powerful erstwhile leader of a breakaway band of Democrats who, for seven years, collaborated with state Republicans. Klein was a charter member of the so-called \u201cIndependent Democratic Conference,\u201d a group of eight Democrats (by the time it folded last spring) that effectively guaranteed GOP control of the chamber. Their power grab inflamed the progressive opposition to Cuomo, who critics say blessed the arrangement because it allowed him greater influence over the kind of legislation that hit his desk \u2013 and protected him from the kinds of liberal bills he never intended to sign but also didn\u2019t want to be seen vetoing. The successes of Biaggi and allies \u2013 including Jessica Ramos and Zellnor Myrie, all three of them endorsed by the Times \u2013 means Cuomo could begin his next term without some old allies and, potentially, be forced to take up a more aggressive agenda. In an interview earlier this week, Biaggi praised Nixon for immediately bringing the Independent Democratic Conference into the headlines upon entering the race, but said it was Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win in late June that began to open doors for her own bid \u2013 sometimes literally. \u201cHer race put a massive crack in cynicism, in a way that people said, \u2018Whoa, this is possible and it can happen here,\u2019\u201d Biaggi said. \u201cMore volunteers came in, more shifts knocking doors, more small-dollar donations, and it has been one of the key pieces to our progress right now.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats maintain a wide lead over Republicans in the race for control of the House of Representatives, a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS finds, including a 10-point lead among those most likely to turn out this November. In a generic ballot test, 52% of likely voters back the Democratic candidate for House of Representatives in their district while 42% back the Republican. Among all registered voters, Democrats hold a 12-point margin over the GOP, suggesting preferences have not shifted much since an August CNN Poll, which did not include an assessment of likely voters.  RELATED: Full poll results. The new poll marks the first time this election season CNN has looked at preferences among likely voters. Typically, likely voters in midterm elections are a bit more Republican-leaning than the broader pool of registered voters. This year, Democrats are expressing just as much interest in voting as Republicans, and voters who are Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents continue to be more enthusiastic about casting a ballot for Congress than those who tilt toward the GOP (56% are extremely or very enthusiastic vs. 50% of Republican voters). The results of the poll suggest a midterm environment that is looking a lot like 2006, when Democrats took control of the House amid widespread voter dissatisfaction with Republican president George W. Bush and his handling of the war in Iraq. In 2010, backlash to President Barack Obama and the passage of Obamacare led to the organization of the ideological Tea Party movement, which boosted Republicans back into control of the House. In September of 2006, CNN polling also found Democrats with a 10-point lead over Republicans on the generic ballot. House's No. 2 Democrat outlines what he would do with a majority The President is a negative motivator for a majority of voters, according to the poll, with 54% saying they would be more apt to support a candidate who opposes President Trump. About a third (36%) say they\u2019re partial to supporting a candidate who backs the President. Those figures have shifted against Trump since the question was last asked in May (48% said they\u2019d prefer an anti-Trump candidate in that poll, 43% a pro-Trump one). Views of the President are closely tied to preferences in the House ballot: Among those likely voters who approve of the way the President is handling his job, 89% plan to back the Republican in their district, while 87% of those who disapprove favor the Democrat. And more Americans say the country would be better off (40%) than worse off (28%) should Democrats take control of Congress in this November\u2019s elections. That\u2019s a wider margin that felt the nation would be better off should Republicans take control back in 2010. Only about a quarter now (27%) say it doesn\u2019t make a difference, fewer than felt that way in 2014 or 2010, suggesting voters see this year\u2019s contest as more consequential. The results come as multiple polls show similar shifts in the Democrats\u2019 favor in the dynamics of the midterm race. It is the third poll released in the past two days to show Democrats with a double-digit lead over Republicans on a generic ballot question. The poll shows Democrats with a huge advantage among women likely voters, 60% say they back the Democrat in their district compared with 36% for the Republican. Among men, Republicans hold a slim 5-point edge. And as in 2016, education is a sharp divider among white voters. Those without college degrees broadly back the Republican (57% for the Republican to 38% for the Democrat) while those who hold four-year degrees favor the Democrat by a similar margin (59% to 37%). Voters on both sides of the battle for the House say they are largely casting votes to support their candidate rather than to make a stand against their opponent. About 6 in 10 voters who choose the Democrat in their district say they are doing so more to vote for the Democrat than against the Republican. Likewise, 60% of Republican backers say they\u2019re casting a supportive vote for the GOP more than one against the Democrats. As this year\u2019s primary season comes to a close, the slate of candidates chosen includes a diversity of backgrounds not often seen in American politics. With a record number of female candidates on major party tickets for Congress and groundbreaking candidates from racial, ethnic and religious minorities landing on ballots across the country, many Americans are now choosing among candidates who resemble them for the first time. The new poll finds a majority of Americans feel it is extremely or very important for Congress to represent the country\u2019s demographic makeup (62% say so), about the same share who say it\u2019s that important for Congress to represent the nation\u2019s political makeup in partisanship and ideology (63%). More, 67%, say it\u2019s critical for Congress to represent the nation\u2019s economic diversity. Brooke Baldwin: 2018 is the year of the woman on the ballot Women (69%) and non-whites (70%) are more apt than men or whites to consider a demographically-representative Congress deeply important. Democrats (82%) say it\u2019s more important than Republicans (44%). Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say it\u2019s important for Congress to represent the nation\u2019s political makeup in terms of partisanship and ideology (76% among Democrats to 55% among Republicans). The economic makeup of Congress is also important to Democrats, who say Congress should represent the country in terms of income and education (78% among Democrats to 59% among Republicans). And looking ahead to the next major election to come \u2013 the presidential nominating contests \u2013 the Democrats who are among the top contenders for their party\u2019s presidential nomination are generally viewed more favorably than unfavorably by their partisans. But outside of the very top tier of candidates, many potential presidential hopefuls are widely unknown. There's a new No. 1 among 2020 Democrats Former Vice President Joe Biden earns near universal positive reviews among his partisans, 86% have a favorable opinion. Bernie Sanders, who finished second to Hillary Clinton in 2016, isn\u2019t far behind with 78% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents holding positive views of him. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren also earns majority-positive ratings among the Democratic electorate at 57% favorability. Majorities of the Democratic electorate are unsure, however, about Cory Booker (53%), Kamala Harris (55%) and Deval Patrick (84%). Among those who do have an opinion about each of them, the reviews are largely positive. The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS September 6 through 9 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, for the subset of 923 registered voters, it is plus or minus 3.9 and for the 775 likely voters plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama spent a sizable amount of time in a speech he gave in Illinois on Friday criticizing Republicans in Congress and President Donald Trump, while stressing the importance of voting in the fast-approaching midterm elections. His step back into the political arena offered a preview of his message for the fall\u2019s midterms. Obama slams Republicans: Trump is 'capitalizing on resentment' Trump quickly responded on Friday, telling a crowd in Fargo, North Dakota, that he \u201cfell asleep\u201d watching Obama\u2019s speech. The Republican National Committee, for its part, responded to Obama\u2019s speech by saying, \u201cPresident Obama stepped back into the spotlight to make the case that our country is on the wrong track.\u201d \u201c2016 is over, but President Obama is still dismissing the millions of voters across the country who rejected a continuation of his policies in favor of President Trump\u2019s plan for historic tax cuts, new jobs and economic growth,\u201d RNC spokesperson Ellie Hockenbury said in a statement. \u201cDemocrats may have a new resistor-in-chief on the campaign trail, but they\u2019ll need more than a message of resist and obstruct to win this November.\u201d Here are some of the Obama\u2019s sharpest attacks on Trump and the Republican Party in his speech at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign: 1. \u201cWhat happened to the Republican Party?\u201d The former Democratic President hit Trump and Republicans hard on a variety of issues including health care, voting rights, campaign finance laws, and the economy, arguing that some policies GOP leaders are pursuing today aren\u2019t conservative. The former President questioned the GOP\u2019s approach to foreign policy, including its position on Russia, challenging climate change science, and embracing of conspiracy theories including those \u201csurrounding Benghazi or my birth certificate.\u201d 2. \u201cThe politics of division and resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party.\u201d Obama argued that today\u2019s generation is the most diverse, \u201cconditions that are ripe for exploitation by politicians who have no compunction and no shame about tapping into America\u2019s dark history of racial and ethnic and religious division.\u201d 3. \u201cRepublicans who know better in Congress, and they\u2019re there \u2013 they\u2019re quoted saying, \u2018Yeah, we know this is kind of crazy\u2019 \u2013 are still bending over backwards to shield this behavior from scrutiny or accountability or consequence, seem utterly unwilling to find the backbone to safeguard the institutions that make our democracy work.\u201d He slammed congressional Republicans for not acting as a check on the Executive Branch. 4. \u201cThey\u2019re not doing us a service by actively promoting 90% of the crazy stuff that\u2019s coming out of this White House, and saying \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we\u2019re preventing the other 10%.\u2019 That\u2019s not how things are supposed to work. This is not normal.\u201d Obama addressed the recent controversy within the White House surrounding The New York Times op-ed written by an anonymous senior Trump administration official. The op-ed author claimed there was a \u201cresistance\u201d of senior officials working in the White House to \u201cfrustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations.\u201d Obama argued that this \u201cnot how our democracy is supposed to work.\u201d 5. \u201cI know there are Republicans who believe government should only perform a few minimal functions but that one of those functions should be making sure nearly 3,000 Americans don\u2019t die in a hurricane and its aftermath.\u201d Obama made mention of the death toll in Hurricane Maria which hit Puerto Rico last year. Puerto Rico\u2019s government raised its official Hurricane Maria death toll from 64 to 2,975 last month. The Trump administration was under fire from Democrats for its response and handling of recovery efforts on the island. 6. \u201cHow hard can that be, saying that Nazis are bad?\u201d Obama argued that, \u201cWe are supposed to stand up to discrimination and we are sure as heck to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers.\u201d In August 2017, Trump was criticized for saying there was \u201cblame on both sides\u201d for the violence at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. 7. \u201cIt did not start with Donald Trump. He is a symptom, not the cause.\u201d Obama argued that Trump is \u201ccapitalizing on resentment that politicians have been fanning for years, a fear, an anger that is rooted in our past, but is also borne in our enormous upheavals that have taken place in your brief lifetimes.\u201d 8. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to do what the Parkland kids are doing. \u2026 And they\u2019re not giving up until we have a Congress that sees your lives are more important than a campaign check from the NRA.\u201d The student activists of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, got a shout-out from Obama as he also attacked the conservatives in Congress who accept donations from the National Rifle Association. Following a February 14 massacre at the school, survivors called on politicians to refuse to take money from the NRA. 9. \u201cIt should not be a partisan issue to say that we do not pressure the attorney general or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents or to explicitly call on the attorney general to protect members of our own party from prosecution because an election happens to be coming up.\u201d Obama\u2019s more veiled attack was a reference to the President\u2019s tweet about Attorney General Jeff Sessions last Monday that also lamented the indictments of GOP Reps. Duncan Hunter and Chris Collins, suggesting they shouldn\u2019t have been charged so close to the midterm elections and because they are Republicans. 10.  \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be the party supposedly of fiscal conservatism. Suddenly deficits do not matter.\u201d Obama slammed the Republican Party\u2019s tax reform bill passed last December, which the former President argued gave \u201c$1.5 trillion in tax cuts to people like me, who I promise don\u2019t need it.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On Thursday morning, Cory Booker said he purposely broke the rules of the Senate. He publicly released 12 pages of emails sent by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh dealing with racial inequality. The documents were marked \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d \u2013 meaning that only members of the Senate Judiciary Committee (which includes Booker) could have access to them. \u201cI understand the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate,\u201d Booker said in making clear he planned to break the rules. \u201cI openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now.\u201d To be clear: Booker isn\u2019t releasing these emails out of the goodness of his heart or solely because he thinks transparency is critically important when voting on a Supreme Court justice. That may well be part of his calculations. But the politics of all of this also plays a large part. Asked afterward about his decision to open himself up to possible expulsion from the Senate, Booker made his motivations quite clear: \u201cA senior senator who is in leadership, I think he\u2019s the number two in leadership has, in effect, called for my expulsion from the United States Senate and and again I just say, \u2018Bring it.\u2019 If he wants to go through that process I fully accept responsibility for what I have done, and again I\u2019m new in this place. This senator has been around a long time. He\u2019s in leadership. I think he was just like a lot of bullies are, a lot of talk and no action. And so let\u2019s see what he does. I\u2019m willing to accept responsibility for my actions, but I don\u2019t know what, I don\u2019t know what that senior senator will do.\u201d Booker is talking here about Texas Sen. John Cornyn who is, indeed the second-ranking Republican in the Senate. Cornyn was particularly exercised about Booker\u2019s decision, telling the committee that \u201crunning for president is no excuse for violating the rules of the Senate. \u2026 This is no different from the senator deciding to release classified information. \u2026 That is irresponsible and outrageous.\u201d The definitive ranking of 2020 Democrats Cornyn is, without question, right about one thing: Booker is very likely running for president. And this decision to break the rules is a calculated one aimed at demonstrating that the New Jersey Democrat knows how to fight dirty \u2013 and is willing to do just that against President Donald Trump. Go back and read that full quote above from Booker. Change the \u201che\u201d from Cornyn to Trump. Still works, right? \u201cI just say, \u2018Bring it.\u2019\u201d \u2026 \u201cI think he was just like a lot of bullies are, a lot of talk and no action.\u201d That\u2019s not by accident. Booker, as well as Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), who made her own moment in a clash with Kavanaugh over the special counsel probe being run by Robert Mueller, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) all understand that they are on a very big stage right now. All politics is, in part, performance. But running for president relies more on performance than running for any other office. Anyone who has ever considered running for the nation\u2019s top office knows that you need to be \u201con\u201d in the big moments, show what you are made of when the people are watching.   And Democratic base voters are VERY much watching this Kavanaugh hearing. They view Trump\u2019s decision to nominate a solid conservative for the seat of swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy as only the latest in a series of massive affronts committed by Republicans, beginning with their total refusal to even meet with Merrick Garland \u2013 President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee to replace the late Antonin Scalia on the court. More than 140 people have been arrested for protesting the Kavanaugh hearing on Capitol Hill over the first two days of hearings. Ayanna Pressley's win shows just being liberal isn't enough in today's Democratic Party Booker knows that one of the biggest complaints from that base about the 2016 election was that Hillary Clinton simply played too nice with Trump. She and her campaign tried to stay within the established rules of a campaign. Trump refused to even acknowledge there were any rules. Clinton, in the mind of the Democratic base, was fighting with one hand tied behind her back. She would never \u201cgo there\u201d on Trump because she and her team believed that getting down in the mud with Trump was a losing proposition \u2013 not to mention those sorts of tactics might do real damage to the health of our political process. Trump had no such concerns. He said and did whatever he believed it took to win. He brought a group of women who had accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct and sat them in the front row of a presidential debate with Hillary Clinton. He promised he would prosecute her if he was elected president. He suggested, repeatedly, that her health was failing and that she was simply not up to the demands of the job of president. He broke, literally, every rule. Did so with relish. And won. Which brings us to the positioning of Democrats for 2020 \u2013 and what 2018 has taught us about the state of the party.  Democratic base voters want not just liberals, but fighters. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rather than Joe Crowley. Andrew Gillum rather than Gwen Graham. Ayanna Pressley instead of Michael Capuano. They want someone who will take the fight to Republicans \u2013 and to Trump in particular. Someone who will stand toe-to-toe with Trump and tell him, to his face, why he deserves to be impeached. Someone not afraid of, well, getting some mud on their shoes. Republicans pushed hard on the idea that Booker was not just grandstanding in advance of 2020, but was doing so under false pretenses. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley\u2019s office insisted the documents that Booker made such a show of releasing on Thursday morning had in fact been cleared to be released earlier in the day. Booker\u2019s office responded by taking a victory lap, insisting that he had \u201cshame[d] the committee into agreeing to make last night\u2019s documents publicly available.\u201d Who has the right in this is hard to tell amid the spin \u2013 and the possibility of miscommunication and mixed signals. But make no mistake: Booker got what he wanted here. Democratic activists won\u2019t care about the timing of the release of the documents. They will remember Booker staring down the Republican Senate majority and President Trump. Remember, presidential politics is, at times, a performance. And Booker gave this one his all. What Booker did \u2013 with clear intent \u2013 on Thursday morning was to show he\u2019s not going to be cowed by the rules of the Senate. Or by a bully. He\u2019s going to say, \u201cBring it,\u201d and get ready to scrap. UPDATE: This story has been updated with a response from Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley\u2019s office, disputing Booker\u2019s portrayal of his document release as breaking the Senate\u2019s rules.",

            "article_content": "One of the most vindictive and ill-tempered congressional hearings in memory appeared to do little to shake up the political realities that will likely see President Donald Trump\u2019s Supreme Court-reshaping nominee confirmed before the midterm elections.  For much of the time, the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing this week added up to exactly the kind of petty, small, negative politics that mourners at Sen. John McCain\u2019s funeral on Saturday used their eulogies to decry. But there was a method to the madness unfolding in the Hart Senate Office Building. For Kavanaugh, the hours of dodging snares laid by Democratic senators boiled down to avoiding huge errors \u2013 especially on the core issue of abortion that would risk the defection of a couple of Republican senators and jeopardize his route to the high court. Unless one of his inquisitors laid a slow burning fuse that leads to a disastrous detonation of a scandal or controversy in the coming days, Kavanaugh seems to be in the clear. Democrats knew going into this week that their minority status in the Senate gave them little hope of blocking Kavanaugh\u2019s march to the bench. But after nearly two years of angst following Hillary Clinton\u2019s shocking defeat in 2016 \u2013 it was time to show backbone and defiance and to give party activists a glimpse of a better future. And for potential 2020 presidential candidates like Democrats Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey, the hearing was an early chance to build buzz and to capture the hearts of primary voters who will soon be shopping for a candidate. Booker releases Kavanaugh documents but GOP insists they were already cleared Kavanaugh made his strategy clear right from the start and never wavered. He presented himself as the picture of independence. Such an approach is now standard for Supreme Court nominees. But it was a more taxing task for Kavanaugh than some recent predecessors given the trampled conventions left in the wake of Trump. And as with all Supreme Court confirmation hearings it was mostly kidology: everyone watching and participating knows how Kavanaugh is likely to swing on important social, political and financial cases, since he was chosen from a list or authentic conservatives compiled by the Federalist Society and Trump vowed on the campaign trail to appoint judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade. Still Kavanaugh had to follow the rituals of this Washington dance. If he said it once, he said it a hundred times: \u201cMy only loyalty is to the Constitution. I have made that clear, I am an independent judge,\u201d he declared. At multiple times, Kavanaugh declared he wanted to stay \u201cthree zip codes\u201d away from politics. While assuring senators he believed no one was above the law, Kavanaugh did nothing to assuage Democratic fears that he was picked by Trump because of writings that suggest a sweeping conception of executive power. Supreme Court justices want politics out of nomination hearings. It didn't happen. \u201cRight now, there\u2019s a shadow over the independence of the judiciary because a President who has been credibly accused by his former lawyer of being an unindicted co-conspirator has the opportunity to put a judge on the bench,\u201d Booker told Kavanaugh. \u201cIt is understandable for people to suspect that there\u2019s something going on. That somehow this is rigged.\u201d Kavanaugh would not say if a sitting president must respond to a subpoena. He gave no quarter when asked if a president can pardon himself \u2013 Trump has argued he has an \u201cabsolute\u201d right to do so. Asked to recuse himself if an issue involving the Mueller probe reaches the Supreme Court he answered: \u201cI should not and may not make a commitment.\u201d There were a few testy exchanges, notably under the quick fire scrutiny of Harris, but Kavanaugh never lost his cool. He did not snap when taunted by Democratic senators, his knowledge of the law, his own past cases, and understanding of political lines it would be unwise to cross would, in a less partisan era, have made it difficult for opponents to argue he wasn\u2019t actually qualified for the court. Kavanaugh also blunted Democratic counter-narratives that he is a harsh ideologue by frequently praising his family, often at the prompting of friendly GOP senators and idealizing his youth in suburban Maryland. At one point he brought in girls from basketball teams he coached. In an ideal world for Democrats, they would have trapped Kavanaugh in a lie, or exposed some deep secret from his past and derailed his nomination. But it was not really a realistic hope. The deck has been stacked against the opposition party ever since the GOP captured a monopoly on power in Washington in 2016. And the demise of the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees during the Neil Gorsuch confirmation fight means tight election wins are more important than ever. For many outsiders the anger and the bitterness and ill feeling that Democrats managed to stoke \u2013 to which Republicans proclaimed themselves theatrically offended \u2013 was yet another infuriating sign of a broken political system. Kavanaugh answers Harris, denies conversations on Mueller probe But for the Democrats, looking down the barrel of a Supreme Court dominated by conservatives for decades, making a noise was the extent of their ambitions. Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa was only a few words into his opening statement on Tuesday when he was interrupted by a sequence of Democrats demanding a halt to the hearing. Objectively, they had a point. More than 100,000 documents detailing Kavanaugh\u2019s work for the Bush administration were withheld by the White House. Another batch of 40,000 were dumped on the committee hours before the hearing, giving no time for a proper vetting. It was only ever going to be a delaying tactic, but the Democrats inflicted pain and frustration on their GOP opponents and left Kavanaugh with a bemused look on his face, anchored to his chair. Veteran Democrats like Dianne Feinstein of California and Dick Durbin of Illinois did much of the jurisprudential heavy lifting. But the hearing also offered a playground to rising stars. Booker revealed himself to be a street brawler \u2013 a quality that might come in handy if he were ever to go up against Trump, On Thursday, he released batches of emails that had been designated as \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d that referenced Kavanaugh\u2019s position on racial profiling and Roe v Wade. Republicans reacted with disgust, accusing the New Jersey senator of breaking Senate rules \u2013 then ridiculed him because some of documents had actually been cleared for release in the early hours of Thursday morning. But nuance doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes to political grandstanding. Booker said he was willing to be kicked out of the Senate for breaking the chamber\u2019s rules and marked himself out for party activists as a Democrat with stomach for the fight. \u201cThis is about the closest I\u2019ll probably ever have in my life to an \u2018I am Spartacus\u2019 moment,\u201d he said. Harris took a more cerebral approach, displaying a forensic skills honed as a district attorney. She was one of the few Democrats who actually seemed to discomfort Kavanaugh \u2013 and now has a long show reel to tap for campaign purposes as she implied that she had information that he discussed the Mueller probe with members of a law firm set up by a Trump attorney. In the end the exchange was inconclusive. But like Booker, Harris won an outpouring of love from liberals on Twitter. And that was really the point.",

            "article_content": "Brett Kavanaugh emerged from two days of tough questioning in the Senate Judiciary Committee without making any obvious missteps that could imperil his confirmation as the justice who will pull the Supreme Court to the right and hand Donald Trump a generational presidential legacy. He avoided ceding ground on the most contentious issues, either by saying he wanted to keep \u201cthree zip codes\u201d away from politics or by arguing that he could not comment on \u201chypothetical\u201d cases that could come before him on the nation\u2019s top bench. Kavanaugh refused to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena \u2013 not an academic issue in the age of Trump. He declined to agree to Democratic calls for him to recuse himself from any cases related to the Russia investigation. And he would not say where he would come down on abortion, amid expectations among conservatives he would like to overturn Roe v. Wade. But Democrats did not walk away from a deeply divisive hearing with nothing. Top lawmakers showed vigor in cross examining Kavanaugh and by portraying him as Trump\u2019s man on the court and may have at least partly lived up to expectations of the party\u2019s fired up base for a show of backbone ahead of the mid-term elections. After emerging largely unscathed after the final round of questions from senators that stretched late into Thursday evening, Kavanaugh could take comfort in passing his biggest test. If Republicans stick together he is almost certain to be confirmed while minority Democrats face their own challenge in keeping the votes of red state senators with tough re-election races in their column. Thursday\u2019s hearing featured another bitter showdown between Democrats who are furious at the failure of the White House to hand over tens of thousands of key documents on time or at all, and at restrictions on the public release of material that was made available. New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker said he was ready to risk expulsion from the Senate for making public documents pertinent Kavanaugh\u2019s time as a top White House aide to President George W. Bush, but the GOP mocked him for grandstanding ahead of a possible 2020 run \u2013 saying it had already cleared the emails for release. In a striking political gambit, Booker, backed up by Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, released emails \u2013 which had been designated as \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d \u2013 that reference Kavanaugh\u2019s position on racial profiling and thoughts on Roe v. Wade dating from his time as a White House official under Bush. Booker, who as a potential 2020 presidential candidate had an incentive to make a splash in the hearing, said he took the action as an act of \u201ccivil disobedience.\u201d \u201cI understand the penalty comes with potential ousting from the Senate. \u2026 I openly invite and accept the consequences of my team releasing that email right now,\u201d Booker said. \u201cThis is about the closest I\u2019ll probably ever have in my life to an \u2018I am Spartacus\u2019 moment,\u201d he added. Republican Sen John Cornyn warned Booker that releasing documents marked \u201ccommittee confidential\u201d would break Senate rules. \u201cRunning for president is not an excuse for violating the rules of the Senate,\u201d the Texas Republican said. Later Thursday, Bill Burck, a lawyer who oversaw the process of providing Bush administration documents, undercut Booker\u2019s grand gesture, saying that the material in question had been cleared on Wednesday night at the request of the senator\u2019s staff. \u201cWe were surprised to learn about Senator Booker\u2019s histrionics this morning because we had already told him he could use the documents publicly. In fact, we have said yes to every request made by the Senate Democrats to make documents public,\u201d Burck said in a statement. Read the committee confidential document Cory Booker released on Brett Kavanaugh The office of Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, also said that senators, including Booker, were notified \u201cbefore they spoke today\u201d that the restrictions on the documents had been waived. Booker, however, insisted he was in the right, saying he read from the documents aloud in the hearing on Wednesday night long before they were cleared at around 4 a.m. Democrats have repeatedly complained that the White House is withholding tens of thousands of documents relevant to the nomination and wants many more that have been provided released to the public. The New Jersey senator also said he doubted Cornyn would follow through on his threats to enforce Senate discipline against him. \u201cI think he\u2019s like a lot of bullies are: a lot of talk, no action,\u201d Booker said. North Carolina Republican Sen. Thom Tillis took exception to his Democratic colleague\u2019s tactics. \u201cCertainly in the six hours between the time that email hit your email box and the theatrics that happened in this chamber today you could have actually found out that you didn\u2019t have to be Spartacus, you didn\u2019t have to go interact with civil disobedience, you got what you wanted,\u201d Tillis said. The schoolyard taunts underlined how the hearing, ahead of what appears to be Kavanaugh\u2019s likely confirmation, has become another battlefield in the vicious partisanship and complete lack of trust between the parties that is wracking Washington at a critical moment of the Trump era Booker\u2019s intervention followed a set of glowing reviews from liberals for another potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidate on the Judiciary Committee, Sen. Kamala Harris of California, who late Wednesday night appeared to discomfort Kavanaugh with a series of questions designed to find out with whom he had discussed special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. Harris returned to the question on Thursday evening, saying that she had been working on \u201creliable information\u201d that Kavanaugh had a conversation about the probe with someone from Kasowitz Benson Torres, the law firm founded by Trump\u2019s personal attorney Marc Kasowitz. Kavanaugh had sidestepped the question on Wednesday, so Harris asked him again and he replied \u201cthe answer\u2019s no.\u201d Earlier, the firm said in a statement to CNN there had been no such discussions. Harris did not disclose the \u201creliable information\u201d on which she based her questions. In another flashpoint development, a previously unreleased 2003 email from Kavanaugh, while he was an official in the Bush White House, shows him raising the point of whether Roe v. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right to an abortion, was settled law of the land. In the internal White House email, obtained by CNN, Kavanaugh wrote: \u201cI am not sure that all legal scholars refer to Roe v. Wade as the settled law of the land at the Supreme Court level since Court can always overrule its precedent, and three current Justices on the Court would do so.\u201d \u201cThe point there is in the inferior court point,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote, responding to a draft op-ed that had been circulated for edits between lawmakers and White House staff. Capitol Police arrest 73 on day two of Kavanaugh hearings The draft, meant to be submitted under the name of \u201chigh-profile, pro-choice\u201d women in support of a Bush judicial nominee, had said that \u201cit is widely understood accepted by legal scholars across the board that Roe v. Wade and its progeny are the settled law of the land.\u201d During the confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Kavanaugh said: \u201cAs a general proposition I understand the importance of the precedent set forth in Roe v. Wade.\u201d Trump said during his campaign that he would appoint Supreme Court justices who would overturn Roe. In recent years, Supreme Court nominees have gotten through their confirmation hearings by refusing to say how they would rule on what they say is a hypothetical future case on the issue. The New York Times first reported the email. Throughout the contentious hearing, now in its third day, Kavanaugh has tried to give political questions \u2013 especially those related to Trump and his potential legal woes \u2013 a wide berth. On Wednesday he insisted that \u201cno one is above the law\u201d but declined to say whether a sitting president must respond to a subpoena. Senate Democrats have suggested that Kavanaugh could be biased in favor of the President and worry that his views on the primacy of executive power could help Trump evade legal scrutiny. Booker warned that given Trump\u2019s frequent attacks on the Justice Department there was a \u201cshadow over the independence of the judiciary\u201d and said it was understandable for some Americans to wonder whether a nominee picked by the President would owe loyalty to him or had been nominated to shield him from a criminal investigation. \u201cMy only loyalty is to the Constitution,\u201d Kavanaugh responded. \u201cI have made that clear, I am an independent judge.\u201d CNN\u2019s David Shortell, Ariane de Vogue, Annie Grayer, Ellie Kaufman, David Siegel, Casey Riddle and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On Monday afternoon, President Donald Trump tweeted this: \u201cTwo long running, Obama era, investigations of  two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job Jeff\u2026\u2026\u201d Trump is referring to the indictments of New York Rep. Chris Collins and California Rep. Duncan Hunter by the Justice Department on charges of insider trading and misuse of campaign funds, respectively. Let\u2019s count all the ways this is wrong. 1. The Collins indictment deals with advice he allegedly gave to his son to sell off a stock in June 2017, and the Collins indictment came down in August 2018. That is not the in the \u201cObama era.\u201d (The investigation into Hunter began in April 2016 \u2013 at the tail end of the \u201cObama era\u201d; but the actual indictment came in August 2018.) 2. Trump is alleging the Justice Department \u2013 which is run by his handpicked Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2013 purposely brought these indictments in the middle of the midterm elections to jeopardize the GOP\u2019s chances. (Reminder: The Justice Department is run by Republican appointees.) 3. Trump takes issue with criminal charges because they take \u201ctwo easy wins\u201d in two GOP-leaning districts and turn them into potentially competitive seats. (Collins retired amid the hubbub over his charges; Hunter has vowed to continue running.) 4. The President of the United States snarkily attacks his own attorney general for doing a \u201cgood job.\u201d It\u2019s hard \u2013 amid all of the norm-busting that Trump has done since he announced for president in June 2015 \u2013 to register any real shock over anything he says or tweets these days. He\u2019s adjusted expectations downward so drastically that everything he says or does produces a sigh and a shrug from most of the public. But just by way of context, let me take you back to the summer of 2009, when, following the arrest of Harvard professor Henry Louis \u201cSkip\u201d Gates at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a new-on-the-job President Barack Obama said that the Cambridge police had \u201cacted stupidly\u201d in arresting a man who had clear evidence he was trying to enter his own home.   Obama was castigated by Republicans for turning the episode into a racial one (Gates is black) and for questioning the police for simply doing their job. Within 48 hours, Obama was apologizing \u2013 saying he wished he had \u201ccalibrated\u201d his words differently. Within days after that, Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Gates and the arresting officer (who was white) were sitting at the White House \u2013 the so-called \u201cBeer Summit.\u201d All of that happened because the President of the United States said a local police force had \u201cacted stupidly\u201d in arresting a guy trying to get into his own house. Now, fast-forward to the present. What we have here \u2013 regardless of your party affiliation \u2013 is this: The President of the United States is openly questioning the indictments of two sitting Republican members of Congress by a Republican-led Justice Department. He is doing so potentially because those two members of Congress were the first two members of Congress to support Trump\u2019s presidential bid but definitely because the indictments jeopardize his party\u2019s chances in the fall election. That \u2013 THAT \u2013 is how far we have come in the space of less than a decade. And what is even more remarkable is that while a handful of congressional Republicans voiced their disapproval with Trump\u2019s views \u2013 the usual suspects like Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) and Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) \u2013 most tried to ignore the tweet, which CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said Tuesday \u201cmay be an impeachable offense.\u201d Whether or not Republicans acknowledge what is right in front of their faces, this much is plain: The current President of the United States sees the Justice Department as an appendage of his own political operation. His public statements suggest he believes the job of the attorney general is twofold: 1) punish the President\u2019s political enemies and b) go easy on the President\u2019s friends. The Monday tweet makes this reality inarguable. (As do the legion of tweets Trump has directed at Sessions, insisting that the special counsel probe into Russia interference is \u201cillegal\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s not \u2013 and demanding the Justice Department look into alleged crimes committed by Hillary Clinton.) \u201cWill DJT never learn that an attorney general\u2019s job is not to play goalie for a president or his party, or any party for that matter?\u201d tweeted conservative commentator Brit Hume, hitting the nail on the head. The answer to that question is, of course, a resounding \u201cno.\u201d Which means that in the space of a decade, we have gone from Republicans castigating a Democratic president for suggesting the local police had acted wrongly in arresting a man trying to enter his home to Republicans largely sitting in silence while a Republican President bashes his own Justice Department for charging GOP congressmen for allegedly breaking the law because doing so is politically inconvenient. And possibly because the two members of Congress facing indictments have been long and loyal supporters of his. That\u2019s a hell of a long way to travel.",

            "article_content": "White House Counsel Don McGahn, the former long-haired campaign finance lawyer, has become an effective, if unlikely, leader of a judicial juggernaut destined to be one of President Donald Trump\u2019s most enduring legacies. How the Trump White House and GOP senators fast-track judicial nominees Federal judges are appointed for life, and McGahn has captained a vetting process that has moved faster than even the renowned judge-picking machine of Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration in the 1980s. Trump announced Wednesday morning on Twitter that McGahn will be leaving in the fall after the Senate acts on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Working closely with conservative advocates and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, McGahn was crucial to Trump\u2019s swift choice of two Supreme Court nominees (Kavanaugh last month and Neil Gorsuch in 2017) and winning Senate confirmation of 26 appeals court judges. Although the nine-member Supreme Court draws most public attention, the country\u2019s 13 appeals courts (the second tier of the three-level US judiciary) can significantly impact the law in American life. The high court takes fewer than 1% of the petitions that reach its doorsteps. Republican administrations in the last half century have made the restocking of the federal courts a priority \u2013 more than Democrats have \u2013 as they have sought to limit or outright reverse liberal-era precedents, such as those establishing abortion rights, allowing racial affirmative action and limiting religious displays in public places. McGahn has followed suit but with more focus and speed. He has been assisted by McConnell, similarly driven to put his mark on the federal bench and by contemporary Senate rules that make it harder for the party in the minority \u2013 currently Democratic \u2013 to block nominees. The Kentucky Republican prevented Senate action on President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court. McGahn has pushed for young, reliable conservatives \u2013 they have been overwhelmingly white and male \u2013 and has conferred regularly with conservative advocates, such as the Federalist Society\u2019s Leonard Leo, in administration choices. As Trump winnowed the field of candidates to succeed the recently retired Justice Anthony Kennedy, McGahn helped steer the choice to Kavanaugh. RELATED: McConnell cuts deal with Democrats to confirm judge nominees As he has explained his job as White House counsel to audiences, McGahn has emphasized the screening of judges. He said the Trump administration has brought a new emphasis to the vetting, tied to its effort to curtail government regulation of business, for example, by agencies covering the environment, workplace safety and consumer protection. In February, McGahn told a conservative conference that Trump wanted judges who had a record of scrutinizing \u201cthe regulatory apparatus.\u201d \u201cOne of the things we interview on is their views on administrative law,\u201d McGahn said, adding, \u201cThis is different than judicial selection in past years.\u201d Of his effort to find judicial candidates who would align with Trump priorities, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence. It\u2019s part of a larger plan.\u201d What the case of a killer whale tells us about Brett Kavanaugh Even with his judiciary successes on behalf of Trump, McGahn has clashed with the President, including over Trump\u2019s attempts to derail the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 US election and any collusion with the Trump campaign. That strained relationship resurfaced earlier this month with the disclosure that McGahn has cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, participating in several interviews. McGahn, 50, is a native of New Jersey who earned his bachelor\u2019s degree at Notre Dame and his law degree at Widener. In private practice, he specialized in election law and then became Trump\u2019s campaign counsel for the 2016 presidential bid. McConnell called the news of McGahn\u2019s impending departure \u201csad news for our country.\u201d \u201cDon is the most impressive White House Counsel during my time in Washington, and I\u2019ve known them all,\u201d McConnell said in a statement. \u201cDon\u2019s significance to the judiciary, the White House and the nation cannot be overstated, and I look forward to his continued efforts on behalf of our country.\u201d RELATED: Yes, Don McGahn leaving the White House is a very big deal",

            "article_content": "A federal court\u2019s rejection of North Carolina\u2019s GOP-rigged congressional district map has thrown in doubt 13 voting districts just months before the November midterm elections, along with prospects for the Republican and Democratic parties in the state and perhaps even the full US House of Representatives. North Carolina gerrymandering decision creates uncertainty ahead of midterms But one thing was clear: The judges who declared the state\u2019s partisan gerrymander unconstitutional on Monday adopted the roadmap of liberal Supreme Court justices over the sentiment of conservatives in the high court\u2019s recent political redistricting battle. The three-judge panel\u2019s reliance on an opinion by Justice Elena Kagan \u2013 which Chief Justice John Roberts had tried to undercut in the case last June \u2013 represents a victory for challengers to partisan gerrymanders. It could embolden other judges who increasingly confront maps that were produced by sophisticated software and voter patterns to ensure that a single party prevails and election outcomes are essentially a foregone conclusion. For now, however, Monday\u2019s ruling adds a new level of chaos to a state already embroiled in ballot and election litigation. The fate of the North Carolina\u2019s map and timing of its midterms is still to be determined by continuing litigation in upcoming weeks. The case could scramble the House battleground map, in which Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to take control. Such a late shake-up would lead to a new round of recruiting efforts, potential retirements and expensive races, just as this year\u2019s primaries conclude and both parties believed they were finally getting a full picture of the playing field. Republican and Democratic campaign officials said their lawyers are still analyzing the ruling and considering their next steps. \u201cI\u2019m shocked by the timing, given that it\u2019s less than three months until the election and given this is an unsettled area of the law,\u201d said Art Pope, a major North Carolina GOP donor and powerbroker. If the court eventually orders new districts drawn before the November election, Pope would \u201cimagine there would be massive lawsuits throughout the country \u2026 you would end up having federal courts draw the districts for 2020. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t think SCOTUS will uphold\u201d the opinion. Asked about the possibility raised in the decision of a November primary with the new map, followed by a January special, Pope speculated the level of interest and spending could be historic. Primary elections in Arizona and Florida: What to watch \u201cThe amount of money if you have a special election in an entire state? It\u2019d probably be the most expensive 13 congressional district elections in the history of the country,\u201d Pope said. Because of ongoing litigation in an unrelated election case, the state had been holding off finalizing ballots for the November 6 midterms. Now the chance exists that the state might have to hasten to produce a new district map. In the Monday ruling, US Appeals Court Judge James Wynn raised several possibilities, including a new redistricting plan and delay in a general election date. He asked the parties to file briefs related to options by 5 p.m. Friday. In the meantime, North Carolina state officials could ask the US Supreme Court to block the effect of Monday\u2019s decision so that the current redistricting plan can be validly used through 2018. With last month\u2019s retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, the high court currently has only eight members, ideologically divided with four conservative justices and four liberals. Five votes are needed to block a lower court ruling. Senate hearings for President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to succeed Kennedy, US Appeals Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh, are scheduled to begin on September 4. If he wins Senate confirmation, he is likely to be sworn in as the ninth justice in late September or early October. The lower court panel that ruled Monday had previously declared the map an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. (An earlier iteration of the congressional districts had been struck down as a racial gerrymander.) In June, the Supreme Court ordered the three-judge panel to reconsider its partisan gerrymander decision based on its ruling in a Wisconsin case that the challengers had lacked legal \u201cstanding\u201d to sue because they had not demonstrated sufficient harm. That ruling was unanimous, but four justices, led by Kagan, split off to offer a blueprint for challengers to show that voting power was diluted in individual districts or mount a statewide claim based on a First Amendment right of free association. In an unusual move, Chief Justice Roberts suggested her concurring opinion should be disregarded. He said the court\u2019s ruling was set forth in his opinion \u201cand none other.\u201d Roberts has made clear that he believes that judges should not take up such cases. He has said that if judges intervened to find that partisan gerrymander had gone too far to infringe on constitutional rights, siding with either Democrats or Republicans, people would view courts as simply favoring one party over another. Arizona and Florida show how tough the Senate map is for Democrats But Kagan stressed the \u201cevils of gerrymandering,\u201d as did Monday\u2019s court, which it found violations based on the constitutional guarantee of equal protection and rights of free speech and association. The appeals court said that the Republican-controlled North Carolina assembly relied on data from past elections showing how particular precincts had voted to \u201cto draw a districting plan that would ensure Republican candidates would prevail in the vast majority of the State\u2019s congressional districts and would do so in future elections.\u201d \u201cPut differently,\u201d Wynn wrote, invoking Kagan phrasing, \u201cthe General Assembly\u2019s Republican majority decided which ideas would prevail in the state\u2019s congressional elections. In doing so, they deprived Democratic voters of their natural political strength by making it difficult for such voters to raise money, attract strong candidates, and motivate fellow party members and independent voters to campaign and vote.\u201d Rather than stay out of such cases, the lower court declared, judges might offer the only place to safeguard constitutional rights. \u201cIndeed, the need for judicial review is at its most urgent in such cases,\u201d Wynn wrote, \u201cfor here, politicians\u2019 incentives conflict with voters\u2019 interests, leaving citizens without any political remedy for their constitutional harms.\u201d Correction: This story has been updated to remove a quote that referred to an incorrect court. The ruling was made by a panel of three federal judges. CNN\u2019s Rebecca Berg and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "On the same night Sen. John McCain\u2019s death was announced, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he wanted to change the name of the Russell Senate Office Building after his friend. But while beloved by his colleagues, Republican senators were mixed in their support for the idea on Monday, as they wandered into the Senate on the first day of session since McCain\u2019s passing \u2013 his desk draped in a black cloth and topped with white roses. Schumer\u2019s plan to introduce a resolution left senators scrambling Monday evening as they returned. Georgia Democratic Sen. Richard Brevard Russell, whom the Senate building is currently named for, was a segregationist who was opposed the Civil Rights Act. Russell served from 1933 to 1971 and helped write the Southern Manifesto, which outlined congressional opposition to racial desegregation. Republican leaders insist they want to honor McCain\u2019s more than three-decades long legacy in the Senate in a serious way, but many cautioned it was too soon to decide exactly how to commemorate his service. Underlying the discussion is the residual animosity between McCain and President Donald Trump, who only praised the Vietnam War veteran\u2019s service and sacrifice 48 hours after his death was announced. McCain's last message read aloud as Washington returns to work without him After he delivered a stirring tribute to McCain on the floor, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked about naming the building after McCain and said only \u201cwe\u2019ll be talking about the best ways to honor Sen. McCain in the days ahead.\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, said he\u2019s open to Schumer\u2019s suggestion. \u201cI am open to that. I think we ought to have a little discussion about changing the name of a building. But certainly John McCain should be recognized in some way. That\u2019s been suggested and it would come through the Rules Committee, I would think,\u201d said Blunt, chairman of Rules Committee. \u201cAnd I think we should actually let at least this week pass before we start talking about how we\u2019re going to memorialize Sen. McCain.\u201d John Thune, the No. 3 Senate Republican, said senators were \u201cvery interested in honoring Sen. McCain,\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t know about the specific idea that has been put out there.\u201d \u201cI am sure we will want to do something. It\u2019s something we\u2019ll want to talk about,\u201d Thune said. Others were more open to Schumer\u2019s proposal. Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who is not running for re-election, said he thought renaming the Russell office building would be a good idea. \u201cI would be glad to do that. I think, you know, Russell was a powerhouse here but most people don\u2019t know who he was. And McCain? McCain was a hero whether you liked some of his approach is or not. I liked them and I\u2019d be for that,\u201d said Hatch, currently the longest serving Republican senator holding office. Sen. Tim Scott said that he would also back the idea. \u201cJohn McCain has served his country in many facets and a building named after him makes a lot of sense to me,\u201d said Scott, the only black Republican senator. \u201cI think the fact of the matter is a prisoner of war for five years who decides to stay there, someone who served in Congress, served in the United States Senate, someone who believed in American exceptionalism. Sounds like a good idea.\u201d The question of whether to rename the Russell Senate office building for McCain is a complicated one for Republicans, putting them at odds with a President who has carried on an adversarial relationship with McCain from the early days of his campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d Trump said on the campaign trail. \u201cI hate to tell you. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. OK?\u201d The relationship between McCain and Trump continued to be tested in the months ahead. In July 2017, McCain voted against a narrow bill that would have advanced Trump\u2019s pursuit to repeal the Affordable Care Act, a move that Trump blasted McCain for at rallies even as the Arizona battled cancer. While Trump\u2019s signature wouldn\u2019t be required for a Senate resolution, the tug of war Republicans may feel could be a factor. Schumer wants Senate building named for McCain Sen. David Perdue, a Georgia Republican who holds Russell\u2019s seat, defended the building\u2019s current namesake. \u201cThis was an icon in the United States Senate. He was Lyndon Johnson\u2019s close adviser. They did the Great Society together. So, people would criticize Richard Russell for maybe being on the wrong side of the integration movement, but my goodness he turned around and got the school lunch program done. He did that himself,\u201d Perdue said, adding that Russell was also a stalwart on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Perdue said he would be opposed to moving forward right now with renaming Russell after McCain and would object on the floor if a member moved to do that. He noted it was hypothetical to assume someone would at this point. Perdue said he talked to Trump Monday morning about spending bills, judicial nominees and McCain\u2019s passing, but he would not comment on if Trump talked with him about renaming the Russell building. \u201cWe talked about John McCain passing. Let\u2019s just leave it at that, OK?\u201d Perdue said. CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough and Kristin Wilson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Mike Murphy has long been on the \u201cA\u201d list of the Republican consulting world, having served as a lead adviser to Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush, among many others. Since the rise of President Donald Trump, he has emerged as a leading voice within the party against Trump. Murphy told The Washington Post this weekend that his party and its leaders were displaying \u201cmoral cowardice\u201d in their refusal to face down Trump over his weaponizing of race, gender and ethnicity. I reached out to Murphy to get him to explain more of that notion and to find out where he thinks the party will go in a post-Trump era. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Over the weekend, you condemned the \u201clarger moral cowardice that has overtaken the party\u201d in the era of Trump. Expand on that idea. Murphy: It\u2019s one thing to accept the normal array of slippery political cheats and dodges in the name of tribal party loyalty with the usual tired rationalization that the \u201cother side is always worse,\u201d but Trump\u2019s activities are so corrupt and corrosive as to elevate the problem way beyond cynical politics. Trump\u2019s actions as President have created a clear moral test: Are you complicit or are you against? Trump has gone so far \u2013 racial demagoguery and slurs, abuse of office, dictator appeasement, nepotism and family corruption, blazing incompetence, contempt for the rule of law, betrayal of public institutions, epic dishonesty, authoritarian thuggishness\u2026 the list never ends \u2013 that he is damaging public institutions and debasing the Presidency of the United States. You either have the courage to oppose that, regardless of blind party loyalty, or you don\u2019t. And the bulk of our party\u2019s elected leaders are showing moral indifference and cowardice about Trump. It\u2019s tragic and sad and makes of mockery of the legitimate criticism the GOP used to level at erring Democrats. It\u2019s a stain on the party that sadly will now last. Cillizza: How different do GOP lawmakers \u2013 and governors, etc. \u2013 talk about Trump privately versus publicly?  And if it\u2019s different, is that delta entirely explained by fear of losing? Murphy: I don\u2019t talk to all of them, but there is widespread contempt. They think he is vain and stupid. But many say they are powerless to change his behavior. The thinking goes: \u201cIf I publicly criticize him he won\u2019t change one bit, but I\u2019ll lose my seat in a primary to a nut and the nut will give the seat to vile socialists on the other side, who are no better than Trump in many ways. Plus we cannot let the liberal Republican-hating media \u2018win.\u2019 So I keep quiet while we rack up important ideological victories \u2013 judges, regulatory reform, taxes \u2013 and wait for this dark storm to pass.\u201d It\u2019s a rationalization I understand, but it gives Trump a moral pass as he ethically urinates all over the institution of the presidency and (the idea of rule of law.)  My response is usually that if 100 of you stood up, he would change. They reply, \u201cPerhaps\u2026 so call me when you get the first 25 signed up and I\u2019ll think then about joining you.\u201d Cillizza: Is there any real Republican Party aside from Trump at this point? If so, what does it look like \u2013 and why don\u2019t we hear more about it? Murphy: It\u2019s pretty much a Trump cult in the GOP primary electorate, particularly outside the blue states of the Northeast. He\u2019s very strong in the sunbelt, Midwest and West. But like all cults, it\u2019ll end badly. Somehow the GOP campaign mindset has gotten aligned to this stupid idea that the general election is essentially nothing more than a big GOP primary, and that primary voters are swing voters who need to be constantly sucked-up-to, while ignoring everybody else. We\u2019ll see how that works out on Election Day outside of hardcore Republican areas. Cillizza: Let\u2019s say Trump loses in 2020. What \u2013 if any \u2013 is the lasting damage the Republican Party will have sustained from his presidency and the way the party reacted to it? Does that change if he is a two-term president? Murphy: I think the bigger question is what happens if we lose the House \u2013 and more \u2013 in the 2018 midterms. If it does happen, such a meltdown will shake the party badly \u2013 no political party endures a major loss without repercussions \u2013 and Trump, the supreme magical winner of 2016, will become an epic party-killing loser. (My guess is Trump will compound this by attacking the party for its loss, since nothing can ever be his fault.)   At that point the idea of running in 2020 under Trump will look like a march to the guillotine, particularly for the GOP Senate majority. That\u2019s when Trump will find himself on the sharp end of the same kind of cynical self-preservation thinking that he\u2019s benefited from to date. Nobody in the family stands up to Tony Soprano until they stop making money and start going to prison. Then it\u2019s time for change. Tony is the last to know. Still, if we hang on to the House by two votes, it\u2019ll read in the expectations bazaar as a big Trump comeback win and he\u2019ll probably be the nominee. Then we\u2019ll be near-certain to lose big 2020. It\u2019ll be our McGovern \u201972 and out of that rubble the 2023-4 GOP primary race will redefine the party, hopefully back to opportunity conservatism. (One crazy prediction: if Trump does hang on, I predict he\u2019ll start talking about dumping Mike Pence as VP. Such a story would create irresistible drama for the reality show producer POTUS. Next year, after the media gives over-implied but loud credit to female voters for any Democratic gains in 2020, White House press leaks will start to appear indicating that while Trump likes good old Pence, he wants to shake things up and after a flurry of hysterical who\u2019s next drama in the media with various names bouncing around, Trump will eventually float the name of Nikki Haley. The media will buy it hook, line and sinker: \u201cA clever Trump master-stroke to get back female and minority voters, blah, blah, blah.\u201d That move will also allow Trump to plunge a satisfying Shakespearean dagger of revenge into Pence, whose own future presidential maneuverings are a bit too transparent for the insecure Trump. Team Pence really needs to read a few Stalin biographies.) Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cThe Republican Party needs to be _____________ in order to survive.\u201d Now, explain. Murphy: \u201cThe Republican Party needs to be freed of Donald Trump and Trumpism in order to survive.\u201d It\u2019s no small thing that Donald Trump lost the popular vote by millions. He stumbled to a lucky lock-pick win in the Electoral College, but the popular vote \u2013 and all the current polling \u2013 shows he decided to pick a fight to the death with the fast-growing segments of the electorate. Only true suckers fight demography. His election was a dead-cat bounce and is extremely unlikely to be repeated. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll survive his first term, but if he does and can win re-nomination, he\u2019ll find a re-elect very daunting. The demography is worse and getting even more difficult every day, the novelty is gone, incompetence is always punished in the fullness of time and the staff machine that exists to prop up an existing POTUS is a weak shambles of dregs and enablers. Ideologically, Trump has cashiered the Republican Party\u2019s longstanding equity as a force for free trade, fiscal conservatism, tough foreign policy and hard-headed competence. Trump now provides political fuel and success only to those who would destroy the conservative movement. He\u2019s driven the GOP into a moral and political ditch, which will likely in time put the county on the left\u2019s road to serfdom at least through the next political cycle. The GOP went on a wild, stupid bender with Trump and now the hangover will be very painful.",

            "article_content": "First things first: The theme song of the week is Gathering Crowds, by John Scott from the television show \u201cThis Week In Baseball.\u201d Poll of the week: A new Quinnipiac University poll finds that President Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating is 41%, with a disapproval rating of 54%. That\u2019s largely consistent with live-interview national polling taken the last few months. When you break it down by race, Trump\u2019s approval rating is 9% among black voters. His disapproval rating is 85% among them. What\u2019s the point: There is another poll out in which more than 30% of black voters supposedly approve of Trump\u2019s job performance. Trump\u2019s biggest fans have trumpeted this poll as a sign that he is breaking through with African-Americans. The problem is the poll is almost certainly incorrect. Polls of higher quality such as Quinnipiac\u2019s \u2013 probability-based polls that are transparent about their data \u2013 have consistently found Trump\u2019s approval rating to be much lower. The President\u2019s approval rating in these polls completed since July has averaged 12% with African-Americans. His disapproval rating has averaged 84%. Here\u2019s the thing though: It does actually seem that Trump has gained support among African-Americans since the 2016 election. The network exit polls had Trump winning only 8% among black voters in 2016. Hillary Clinton took 89% of their vote. That is, Clinton won black voters by an 81-percentage-point margin. Trump\u2019s average net approval rating (approval rating minus disapproval rating) with blacks right now is -72 points. In other words, he\u2019s shrunk his deficit by 9 points. I would argue, though, that the President has made an even bigger improvement. To make an apples-to-apples comparison, we can look at a post-election Pew Research Center study with verified voters. Pew found that Clinton had an even larger margin 85-point margin with black voters, of 91% to 6%. If this study were correct, it would mean that Trump had doubled his black support since the election. (Note: Trump\u2019s approval rating with blacks in a Pew poll in June, not included in our average, was 14%. Again, this suggests he has gained since the election.) Even with averaging, the African-American subsample in these polls is small enough that our current estimate of Trump\u2019s approval rating comes with a fairly wide margin of error. That\u2019s why I decided to look at the President\u2019s average approval rating since April in Gallup\u2019s tracking poll. Doing so gives us a total sample of about 2,500 black respondents, a fairly robust sample size. In this Gallup data since April, Trump\u2019s approval rating has averaged 13%. His disapproval rating has averaged 84%. Both of which are slightly better for Trump than our average since July. What\u2019s interesting is that when you compare Trump\u2019s approval rating in Gallup polling with the percentage of the vote he got against Clinton in every other ethnic or racial group, Trump is doing worse now than he did back in 2016. Is it possible that these high-quality pollsters are simply missing black respondents who dislike Trump? Sure. That, though, is a theory without any evidence that I know of. Could it be that some African-Americans are saying they approve of the President but they won\u2019t end up voting Republican in an election? Of course. Additionally, many black voters undecided on Trump may go with the Democrats in the end. That said, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any sign of that in polling from Marist College, Quinnipiac, Pew or the The Washington Post. The Democratic margin on the generic congressional ballot with black voters isn\u2019t any greater in these polls than Trump\u2019s net approval rating among them would imply. It just seems that for whatever reason the President has picked up a small, but statistically significant, amount of support among African-Americans. The fact that he has done so while losing support among all other racial groups makes it that much more impressive. It\u2019s not clear that this shift in sentiment will make much of a difference in 2018. Democrats still hold a sizable lead on the generic congressional ballot. A lead large enough that they should win control of the House, if everything holds through November. Still, the importance of even a slight shift in African-American voter sentiment shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. They make up greater than 10% of the US electorate, and more in key swing states like Florida, Michigan and Virginia. If you were to apply the changes we see in Trump\u2019s approval rating among blacks compared with his vote share in 2016 and all other groups voted the same, it would mean a shift in the national margin of about 1 percentage point toward him. In these swing states mentioned, it could be even greater. One point may not seem like a lot, but remember that\u2019s half of Clinton\u2019s national margin in 2016. George W. Bush was able to win 2004 in part because he made a small gain among black voters similar to that Trump seems to have made since his own election. If Trump is able to hold on to his additional African-American support, it could aid him in 2020.",

            "article_content": "In the wake of Omarosa Manigault Newman\u2019s departure from the West Wing in December and recent tell-all book rollout replete with accusations of racism, a senior White House official was asked simply: Who is the most senior black aide on President Donald Trump\u2019s staff? After an awkward delay, the answer from Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the President, was \u201cJa\u2019Ron.\u201d It would fall to recently departed White House aide Marc Short later in the Sunday morning broadcast to provide the full name for the staffer she was referencing: Ja\u2019Ron Smith, special assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. The episode thrust Smith into the spotlight as the White House faced questions about its interest and commitment to diversity. None of the 48 assistants and deputy assistants to the President are black. White House will 'try to diversify' staff, Sarah Sanders says Hired in 2017 to serve as an adviser to Trump on Urban Affairs and Revitalization, Smith was tasked with pursuing Trump\u2019s agenda on a slate of issues important to the black community, including prison reform and historically black colleges and universities. \u201cThere were a lot of people who were upset that he joined the administration because they felt he had turned his back on the community that he said he wanted to help,\u201d said one Republican close to the White House. It is a challenging assignment: Trump entered the White House having only won 8% of the black vote. The President has also antagonized black Americans by claiming that there were good people on \u201cboth\u201d sides of a deadly rally in Charlottesville held by White supremacists and Nazis and his prolonged criticism over protests of racial injustice by NFL players. Most recently, Manigualt Newman\u2019s book about her time working for Trump, she has resurrected rumors of an alleged tape of Trump saying the \u201cN-word\u201d during a taping of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the reality television show that made both of them household names. The White House did not make Smith available for comment. Shortly before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Smith was contacted about coming on board as an urban affairs and revitalization policy adviser, a decision that he knew would be controversial. \u201cHe was well aware that he would be called an \u2018Uncle Tom,\u2019 \u201d said one source familiar with Smith\u2019s thinking at the time. \u201cHe was willing to bear the cross at this point in his life. He sees the bigger picture.\u201d He\u2019s since been promoted to special assistant to the President for domestic policy, and in June, to special assistant to the President for legislative affairs. At the White House, Smith has been a constant presence on conference calls, briefings with journalists. And most recently at Trump\u2019s meeting on prison reform convened at his golf course in Bedminster last week and at his meeting with inner-city pastors before that. Smith called the meeting with pastors a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d during brief remarks earlier this month and told the President it was \u201copportunity to learn about a community that has felt left behind for years.\u201d A Howard University graduate with a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree in Divinity, Smith has more than a decade of experience on Capitol Hill, working in politics as an aide to then-Congressman Mike Pence when he was chairman of the Republican Conference. Smith later served as an aide to Republican Sen. Tim Scott. Scott called Smith a \u201csignificant member of my team\u201d in a statement to CNN, citing his contributions on banking, tax, and social and conservative policy. \u201cI\u2019m proud to witness his growth throughout his career in Washington,\u201d he said. Smith, during an appearance last year on the National Association for County Community and Economic Development\u2019s Holistic Housing Podcast, said his life in politics \u201cwasn\u2019t anything I planned.\u201d But his upbringing in a single-parent household in Cleveland in the 1980s launched his path to public service, Smith said. \u201cWhen I was in high school, I saw friends and people I love who started to fall off that ladder of opportunity and that has really inspired me to do something to be a change or represent the interests of people who can\u2019t really speak for themselves,\u201d he said. Smith interned for Oklahoma Congressman J.C. Watts, a black Republican, shortly after the 2000 election of George W. Bush. It was there that he discovered his conservative leanings. \u201cGrowing up where I grew up, Republicans were like a bad word,\u201d he told the podcast. \u201cI had to learn what it meant to be a conservative. It really was, you know, cultivating individuality\u2026 Well that\u2019s what I\u2019m all about, because I think everyone has talents and gifts, if given the right opportunity. And so that really led me on a whole pursuit of truth and figuring out what\u2019s the right way to revitalize and create opportunity for people.\u201d Trump has no black senior White House staff Even as Smith has played a role in the White House\u2019s public efforts to demonstrate engagement on issues that matter to communities of color, he still does not work in the West Wing, nor does he hold the title that Manigault Newman did before her departure: Assistant to the President, a title that comes with the maximum salary of $180,000. Asked on Wednesday how many black White House aides currently work in the West Wing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders refused to say. \u201cAs I addressed yesterday, we value diversity not just at the White House but throughout the administration,\u201d Sander said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to go through and do a count.\u201d But as the number of black staffers in the White House has dwindled, the pressure on those that remain in the administration has increased. And the scrutiny surrounding Smith as a result of this latest episode with Manigault Newman only heightens the risks for other black Republicans considering joining the administration, Short said. \u201cI think that over time it\u2019s now become a bigger problem because people feel like if I join, I\u2019ll be under a microscope,\u201d Short said. As Trump and the White House have come under scrutiny for this and other issues related to race, some wonder why a qualified policy aide like Smith has not been promoted \u2013 especially in Manigualt Newman\u2019s absence. \u201cThis is the only White House in 50 years that hasn\u2019t had an African-American advising the president. How does that happen?\u201d said Shermichael Singleton, a Republican strategist who briefly worked as an aide to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson before he was fired for his 2016 campaign criticism of Trump. \u201cIt would definitely send a message that they\u2019re serious.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t get any more serious than appointing people to roles where they have influence,\u201d he added. Omarosa's book marks stunning turn-around for a former top aide There have always been few black aides on Trump\u2019s West Wing staff \u2013 now the number is even fewer after at least two others departed earlier this year. Daris Meeks, who worked as a domestic policy adviser to Vice President Mike Pence rejoined the private sector and Mary Elizabeth Taylor, who was the deputy director of Legislative Affairs of Nominations has been nominated for a State Department position. Smith, who like Meeks and Taylor, were brought in the Trump orbit by Short, the recently departed White House legislative affairs director. Smith remains one of the only staffers holding a prominent role in this White House. Within the White House he is well liked, and he is considered knowledgeable and competent among advocates, despite their skepticism of Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cI hired Ja\u2019Ron 10 years ago on Pence\u2019s staff in leadership,\u201d Short said. \u201cHe has a very engaging personality. His network of friends is enormous as are his Hill associates. Ja\u2019Ron is a great asset to any legislative affairs office.\u201d Meanwhile, some black Republicans, including Kay Cole James, president of the Heritage Foundation, have alleged that Manigault Newman played a role in blocking the appointment of other black Republicans to White House roles. They say she sought to remain the only senior black adviser in Trump\u2019s orbit. But one former Trump administration official offered another explanation: a former reality television star\u2019s prominence as the top black official in the White House signaled a lack of serious interest in the issues important to African-Americans. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a question where people would say, if you have Omarosa in that role, are you serious?\u201d the former official said.

            "article_content": "Christine Hallquist\u2019s bid to become the country\u2019s first transgender governor will clear an historic hurdle on Tuesday. Hallquist will win the Democratic primary in Vermont, CNN projects, becoming the first transgender gubernatorial nominee for a major political party, a breakthrough of both substantial and symbolic importance for LGBTQ Americans, in particular the trans community, which has for so long been shut out of the highest levels of elected office. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Tuesday night, Hallquist said the result didn\u2019t surprise her and noted Vermont\u2019s progressive record on civil rights issues. But like so many Democrats in 2018, she also pointed to Washington, DC, and President Donald Trump as her reason for jumping into a political campaign for the first time. \u201cThere\u2019s a systematic attack and it\u2019s going to start with the most marginalized of the communities, so the fact that our President has gone after the transgender community is no surprise and I think everybody should be afraid,\u201d Hallquist told Lemon. She also cast the current upheaval as an opportunity for new voices to emerge and reshape the conversation. \u201cPeople like myself and who normally wouldn\u2019t be in politics are rising up all over (in response to Trump\u2019s election) and I think that\u2019s what healthy democracy looks like,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that years from now we can look back and say, \u2018Isn\u2019t American democracy wonderful: we survived a death spot.\u2019\u201d A former energy company executive, Hallquist had established herself as a trailblazer before entering politics. She transitioned publicly during her time as leader of one of the state\u2019s largest utilities, becoming the first CEO to do so while in the job, according to the Victory Fund, a political action committee backing Hallquist and \u201cdedicated to electing openly LGBTQ people\u201d up and down the ballot. \u201cMy path to being my authentic self was certainly not easy,\u201d she said upon announcing her entry into the race earlier this year. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s always been important to me to live openly and honestly. I chose to transition in a very public way because I felt I owed it to those at Vermont Electric Cooperative who put their trust in me.\u201d Hallquist campaigned on a promise to build up renewable energy and boost the state\u2019s rural economy by expanding broadband access. Backed by the Justice Democrats, the same group that helped launch Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s campaign in New York, along with the Working Families Party and Trans United Fund, Hallquist supports \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour and has pledged to address racial disparities in the state\u2019s criminal justice system. But as she told CNN in June, it was the public response to her transition that gave her the confidence to hit the campaign trail. \u201cI was sure I was going to lose my job. I was sure I was going to lose respect. But that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Hallquist said. \u201cSo this describes the beauty of Vermont. Now I\u2019m at this point where I can\u2019t do enough to give back to Vermont.\u201d After outlasting a field of four Democratic hopefuls, one of them a teenage boy, she will now take on Republican Gov. Phil Scott, who will survive his GOP primary challenge, CNN projects. Scott regularly ranked among the most popular governors in the country early on in his two-year term, but his standing has taken a hit recently, particularly among conservatives, following his April decision to sign a bill tightening gun restrictions. The race to unseat Scott mostly played out under the radar \u2013 nationally and even within the state. A survey from Vermont Public Radio and Vermont PBS found voters saying as recently as a few weeks ago that they were unfamiliar with the incumbent\u2019s Democratic challengers. Hallquist, though, had the best name recognition numbers of the bunch, at 41%, 12 percentage points ahead of fellow Democrat Brenda Siegel, who will likely finish second. Hallquist is one of more than 400 LGBTQ candidates running in this cycle, a record according to the Victory Institute. This past weekend, Hawaii\u2019s Kim Coco Iwamoto fell short in her bid for the lieutenant governor nomination in the state\u2019s Democratic primary. Another trans candidate, Democrat Alexandra Chandler, is running in a crowded primary field for the chance to replace Rep. Niki Tsongas in Massachusetts\u2019 3rd Congressional District. In 2017, Democrat Danica Roem made history with her election to the Virginia House of Delegates, becoming its first transgender member. The campaign ahead in Vermont figures to be an interesting one, especially given that Hallquist has said she voted for Scott \u2013 a \u201cnice guy,\u201d as she put it in an interview with VTDigger \u2013 in 2016. But like so many other Democrats this year, she came out of the gates framing her bid as a moral imperative: part of a broader effort to push back against President Donald Trump. \u201cThis is not a time in American history to sit back and be apathetic,\u201d Hallquist said at her campaign kickoff. \u201cWe must be bold in the face of the headwinds from Washington, we must be bold in the face of continuing unpredictability from Congress, and we must be bold in the face of the chaos from the White House.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Aides to President Donald Trump questioned him during the 2016 campaign about the existence of an audio tape in which he purportedly said the N-word, a racial epithet, during production of his reality TV show \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d But officials\u2019 divergent accounts, shifting stories, and an overall dearth of credibility have combined to create little clarity on the circumstances surrounding those conversations. Corroboration of the campaign\u2019s concern over the tape \u2013 whose existence has yet to be verified \u2013brought the controversy surrounding former Trump aide Omarosa Manigault Newman\u2019s new book into another day, even as Trump and his aides sought to discredit and attack her character. Trump campaign taking legal steps against Omarosa Lynne Patton, a Trump campaign aide and assistant to one of the President\u2019s sons, told fellow campaign officials on a call in October 2016 that she confronted Trump about the existence of the tape and that he denied it, according to a recording of the call publicly released Tuesday morning by Manigault Newman on CBS. \u201cI said, \u2018Well, sir, can you think of anytime this might have happened?\u2019 and he said no,\u201d Patton said on the call with Manigault Newman, Katrina Pierson, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, and Jason Miller, the campaign\u2019s communications director, according to the audio released Tuesday. Besides Miller, all three aides are black. During the same call, Pierson says she doesn\u2019t believe the President\u2019s denials, but began to consider how she could \u201cspin it\u201d should the alleged tape become public. \u201cHe said it,\u201d Pierson says. \u201cNo, he said it. He\u2019s embarrassed.\u201d Pierson and Patton did not deny the authenticity of the audio recording in a statement on Tuesday, a departure from their previous statements on the matter. \u201cDuring the 2016 campaign, we heard rumors about an alleged tape from \u2018The Apprentice.\u2019 It\u2019s clear now that those rumors were always being circulated by Omarosa and her alone,\u201d said Pierson, now an adviser to Trump\u2019s re-election campaign. \u201cIn her secret tape recording of me, it was one of many times that I would placate Omarosa to move the discussion along because I was weary of her obsession over this alleged tape,\u201d Pierson wrote. \u201cThat discussion was nothing other than sifting through unconfirmed rumors regarding the Apprentice tape.\u201d Pierson\u2019s explanation was one in a series of shifting accounts about the Trump campaign\u2019s worry over the purported \u201cApprentice\u201d tape. On Monday evening, before tape of the phone call was made public, Pierson denied such a call ever transpired. \u201cThat did not happen. It sounds like she\u2019s writing a script for a movie,\u201d she insisted. Despite her assertion on the recording that Trump did use the racial epithet, Pierson said on Tuesday she does not believe that Trump used the N-word. \u201cNo. I do not,\u201d Pierson said via text message when asked. Kellyanne Conway, a top aide to Trump and one of Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign managers, also signaled to reporters on Tuesday that she told Trump about rumors that an audio tape of him using the N-word existed. \u201cIt was my job to tell the President every rumor, innuendo, fact, fiction,\u201d Conway said when asked whether she told him about the alleged tape. The competing storylines came as Trump and his associates escalated their attacks on Manigault Newman, who was fired from the White House in December. \u201cWhen you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn\u2019t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!\u201d the President tweeted early Tuesday. When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn\u2019t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog! The bitter language drew immediate recriminations from Trump\u2019s critics, including Sen. Jeff Flake, a retiring Republican from Arizona who has frequently spoken against the President. \u201cThis kind of language is unbecoming of a President of the United States. There is no excuse for it, and Republicans should not be okay with it,\u201d Flake tweeted. This kind of language is unbecoming of a President of the United States. There is no excuse for it, and Republicans should not be okay with it. https://t.co/0TLmRT7y22 The use of \u201cdog\u201d to describe Manigault Newman, who was the highest ranking African-American in Trump\u2019s White House during her tenure, did little to dampen the renewed allegations of racism against the President. Some of his top aides rushed to defend him, claiming they\u2019d never witnessed him use racist language in their interactions. \u201cI\u2019ve been around @realDonaldTrump publicly & privately for 25yrs. I\u2019ve NEVER ONCE - EVER - have heard him say the disgusting & terrible word that the Opportunistic Wacky Omarosa claims,\u201d wrote Dan Scavino, Trump\u2019s longtime social media director.",

            "article_content": "The chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus blasted proposed changes to Democratic \u201csuperdelegate\u201d rules that would limit their ability to vote on the first ballot for the party\u2019s presidential nominees. In a letter to Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez dated Monday, Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond wrote on behalf of \u201cmany\u201d of his colleagues in the caucus to urge him to withdraw support of the changes to be voted on at the party\u2019s meeting at the end of the month. \u201cThere should be enough room in the process to include the perspective of local party activists and officials, and Members of Congress. One group should not be harmed at the expense of the other,\u201d Richmond wrote. \u201cPassage of the reforms in their current form would disenfranchise elected officials for no substantive reason and would create unnecessary competition between those elected and their constituents.\u201d The proposed plan \u2013 known as the \u201cthird way plus\u201d option \u2013 does not allow superdelegates to vote at the convention for the presidential nominee on the first ballot unless a candidate has been certified to have earned a majority of the entire convention through pledged delegates only. This ensures superdelegates could not change the outcome of the nomination process on the first ballot, which detractors of the plan point out has never happened since they were created in the 1980s. During the 2016 nomination process, superdelegates \u2013 who made up about 15% of all delegates at the convention \u2013  came under intense criticism by supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders. They argued that Hillary Clinton\u2019s early superdelegate support bolstered her position during the primaries, in which she beat the Vermont senator for the Democratic nomination. The contentious primary battle led to the formation of the \u201cUnity Reform Commission\u201d by the DNC to recommend ways to reform the nomination process to the Rules and Bylaws Committee. Their report included reducing superdelegates by about 60%, which didn\u2019t go far enough for many Sanders supporters, leaving committee members to find a stronger option that eventually became the current proposal. Many committee members commented during these meetings that the frustration was mostly a perception problem, but they still looked for common ground among activists angered by the process to ensure they felt included by the new changes. While the debate about the rules was strong and sometimes contentious, of the over two dozen members representing a diversity of racial and ethnic backgrounds on the committee, the only votes to abstain from supporting the plan were from former party chairs Don Fowler and Donna Brazile. In the final vote, no member voted outright to oppose recommending the plan to the full DNC. Richmond, who wrote the plan appears to be \u201ca solution in search of a problem,\u201d is one of a handful of members of Congress who have been lobbying Perez and other DNC members to oppose this, arguing that limiting the superdelegate role does not embolden activists. \u201c[W]e do not think the effort to empower local leaders in the nomination process is served well by diminishing the power of Members of Congress,\u201d Richmond wrote. \u201cAuthors of the reforms have stated they seek to ensure that delegates elected by voters in primaries and caucuses have the primary role in selecting the Party\u2019s nominees. This aim ignores the fact that voters elect Members of Congress every two and six years. There is no reason to honor one election and not the other.\u201d A group of DNC members, led by Fowler, have been in discussions with party members about the plan looking for other members who oppose the proposal. Fowler, who was on the original commission that created the superdelegate system, lambasted the plan to CNN last month, saying, \u201cIt is regressive, it is not a reform. It\u2019s regressive.\u201d He estimated hundreds of African-American, Latino, LGBTQ, and handicap superdelegates would be affected by the change. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like reform to me,\u201d Fowler said. He\u2019s also accused DNC members of not following proper legal procedure to alter their rules. The rules committee, along with DNC counsel Graham Wilson, agreed that the superdelegate changes would be a bylaws change which only requires a majority vote of DNC members. Fowler argues the changes need to be included into the DNC\u2019s charter, which would require a two-thirds vote at their upcoming meeting, which most members think would not be possible to attain. He told CNN he would challenge this ruling on the DNC floor during the upcoming vote. The full DNC meeting will take place in Chicago at the end of the month. Should the proposal fail, Democrats will either abide by the rules that governed the 2016 election or scramble for a new option to have a delegate process in place ahead of next year, when candidates for 2020 will start openly campaigning for president (and delegates).",

            "article_content": "Omarosa Manigault Newman entered the White House as one of President Donald Trump\u2019s longest-serving associates, the only person aside from his daughter who\u2019d known and worked alongside him for more than a decade. She was given an office, an assistant and the highest salary afforded an administration staffer. Those days, she announces with flourish in a new memoir, are over. Her dramatic divorce from a man she likens to a cult leader is the subject of a salacious, self-serving, mostly unverifiable account of her West Wing tenure, \u201cUnhinged: An Insiders Account of the Trump White House\u201d (Gallery Books, 330 pages). Early excerpts have been denounced by White House officials, who are launching a concerted effort to discredit their former colleague. Asked about his former friend and aide on Saturday, Trump was frank. \u201cLow-life,\u201d he declared during a rain-soaked photo-op with motorcyclists at his New Jersey golf club. \u201cA low-life.\u201d The book is due to be released next week, but CNN obtained a copy on Friday. In it, Manigault Newman describes a mentally waning, racist and lewd, charismatic but emotionally abusive, man overseeing a conniving cast of aides and family members whose varied goals rarely include the betterment of the nation. Omarosa claims Trump campaign offered her job in exchange for silence Manigault Newman was previously best known for her polarizing character on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d She insists her firing last December was because she knew too much about a possible audio recording of the President uttering a racial epithet, which she claims was the subject of deep consternation among campaign \u2014 and later White House \u2014 aides. Manigault Newman provides no proof of the alleged recording. She writes she turned down an offer from Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law to sign a nondisclosure agreement in exchange for a job on the President\u2019s re-election campaign paying $15,000 per month. The book did not include a copy of the nondisclosure agreement, but The Washington Post said it reviewed it. The campaign declined CNN\u2019s request for comment. Manigault Newman, who was in charge of Trump\u2019s African-American outreach, also recounts instances that made her re-think her loyalties to the President and the administration, particularly in the wake of the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville in August 2017. \u201cDonald Trump, who would attack civil rights icons and professional athletes, who would go after grieving black widows, who would say there were good people on both sides, who endorsed an accused child molester; Donald Trump, and his decisions and his behavior, was harming the country. I could no longer be a part of this madness,\u201d she wrote. Manigault Newman, however, remained employed at the White House for several months after the deadly Charlottesville rally and did not leave voluntarily. Her book, and the account it provides of a President who stokes racial tensions for political purposes, comes about one-year after the rally. But there are very few particulars that can be verified in her book; many are clearly wrong, such as an inaccurate account of what Trump said during remarks on his second day in office at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. Poll: Trump is as strongly disliked now as Nixon was before he resigned Quoting Trump\u2019s early, post-inauguration speech at the CIA lamenting his inauguration crowd, Manigault Newman takes some editorial liberty, adding within quotation marks that Trump says, \u201cLiars! Fake news!\u201d He did not say that. Others are being denied by the White House, some more forcefully than others; a description about the drama of installing a tanning bed in the White House residence is untrue, officials insisted, claiming there is no such apparatus in Trump\u2019s home. Other details Manigault Newman passes off as her own original observations, even if they were reported on months or even years ago, like the inability of Trump staffers to turn on the lights during meetings early in the administration. On Friday, as excerpts from Manigault Newman\u2019s book emerged, the White House decried the author and the media for offering her their attention. Press secretary Sarah Sanders, who was on vacation, wrote the book is \u201criddled with lies and false accusations.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sad that a disgruntled former White House employee is trying to profit off these false attacks, and even worse that the media would now give her a platform, after not taking her seriously when she had only positive things to say about the President during her time in the administration,\u201d Sanders wrote. Stephen Colbert grills Omarosa on Trump presidency and her 'plantation' comment The memoir features Manigault Newman describing having witnessed disturbing scenes of the President making lascivious comments about his own daughter Ivanka, who Manigault Newman alleges \u201cuses his obsession with her to her advantage.\u201d Meantime, Trump is quoted dismissing his eldest son Donald Trump Jr. as a \u201cf**k up.\u201d And she compares the President\u2019s mind to a dull blade, suggesting he no longer pronounces long words correctly and has trouble recollecting his rationale for major decisions, including firing FBI Director James Comey. The deterioration, she posits, is perhaps due to his copious intake of Diet Coke. A recurring subplot is Manigault Newman\u2019s enmity toward chief of staff John Kelly, who she accuses of \u201clocking\u201d her in the basement Situation Room in order to fire her on dubious grounds (she was accused of misusing the White House car service). In his bid to bring order to a fractious West Wing, Kelly had earlier imposed stricter rules about who had access to the President, a move that senior officials said limited Manigault Newman\u2019s time in the Oval Office. Still, as the White House aide who had one of the longest relationships with the President, Manigault Newman enjoyed rare stature, at least at moments. She was a contestant on the first season of NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d and later worked on Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. Her paycheck was among the largest in the building, according to public records, and she remained a highly visible face of the administration. In her book, Manigault Newman attempts to explain why she remained at his side, even as he took steps that angered her. \u201cDonald Trump was uncannily intuitive and extremely perceptive. He seemed to be able to sense when certain individuals were susceptible to being influenced by his power and abiding by his loyalty demands,\u201d she writes, explaining Trump\u2019s pull. Omarosa denies there was a dramatic confrontation at the White House The offer of money and a job in exchange for signing a non-disclosure agreement, however, raised Manigault Newman\u2019s hackles. \u201cTreating someone with love and kindness after abuse is a classic cult tactic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI felt myself being manipulated, but refused to allow that to happen.\u201d White House aides aim to push back against Manigault Newman by going after her credibility and disputing parts of the book they perceive as unfair, said a White House official who would not go on the record. The official said their approach would be similar to their response to Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury\u201d roll out. Then, officials attacked Wolff\u2019s reputation, claimed specific people had been misquoted and sent aides and surrogates on shows to trash the book. This official says the White House doesn\u2019t know everything the former staffer has claimed because it appears they have not seen a copy of the book. But in the battle of credibility between a scorned staffer and an administration that routinely lies, few winners emerge. \u201cThis White House has a problem with the truth,\u201d Manigault Newman writes, seeming to pre-empt the pushback the West Wing launched even before the publication date. \u201cBut at least they are consistent \u2013 and only too predictable \u2013 with the lies they tell.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sarah Westwood, Jeremy Diamond and Abby Phillip contributed to this report.",

Tom Garrett said Saturday that he was told during a briefing with the FBI director that Russian meddling played in a role in \u201cfomenting the flames of what happened in Charlottesville,\u201d Virginia, one year ago, when a white nationalist rally turned violent and resulted in the death of a counterprotester. \u201cI sat in a closed session briefing probably two months ago about Charlottesville with the director of the FBI, amongst others, and asked if Russian inter-meddling had to do with fomenting the flames of what happened in Charlottesville. I was told yes, it did,\u201d Garrett told CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles on \u201cNewsroom.\u201d The congressman from Virginia said he asked during the briefing if the information was classified and was told it is not. Garrett, a member of the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs committees, said that Russian interference is \u201cseeking to pit Americans against Americans to undermine confidence in Western-style democracies.\u201d Referring to Russia, the congressman said, \u201cThey use events like this divisive racial fight \u2026 and this is the sort of thing they do. As a member of Homeland Security, that\u2019s what scares me most, that Americans will be pitted against Americans over real differences, but that are minimal in the grand scheme of things. We are an American family of brothers and sisters regardless of religion and race, and we need to focus on that.\u201d The FBI declined to comment on the congressman\u2019s remarks. FBI Director Christopher Wray referenced Charlottesville last month while discussing foreign interference at the Aspen Security Forum in Colorado and said \u201cforeign influence\u201d is playing a role in efforts to \u201cspin up domestic extremist movements.\u201d \u201cAlong the lines of the question about Charlottesville, for example, to the extent that we have domestic terrorism in this country that is spun up by various ideologies, foreign influence is being used, in many ways, to capitalize on that and spin up domestic extremist movements to create terrorist attacks here inside,\u201d he said. The Wall Street Journal reported last fall that Facebook accounts that appeared to be linked to Russian entities posted extreme messages, including anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant messages after the 2016 election and racially divisive messages during the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville last August.

In an interview with CNN\u2019s Erica Hill on \u201cNew Day\u201d Thursday morning, Ferguson city councilman Wesley Bell discussed the four-year anniversary of the death of Michael Brown and how the community has changed since. \u201cYou know, what I can say in Ferguson and in the region, is that a lot of uncomfortable conversations have been had and people are a lot more comfortable being in those uncomfortable spaces if you will,\u201d Bell said. \u201cWe have to be able to talk about implicit bias,\u201d Bell continued. \u201cWe have to be able to talk about cultural sensitivity because that\u2019s the only way we are going to move our region, our country forward in a meaningful way.\u201d Robert McCulloch, the prosecutor whom Bell defeated on Tuesday, was widely criticized for his handling of the investigation into the conduct of Officer Darren Wilson, a white police officer who fatally shot and killed Brown after a brief altercation in a street in Ferguson in 2014. Wilson was never charged in connection with the case, which eventually touched off a Justice Department probe that accused the Ferguson police department of systematic racial bias. The Justice Department also said its investigation did not support federal civil rights charges against Wilson. The decision not to indict Wilson set off massive protests in Ferguson that led to rioting and an extreme police crackdown on the city which gained national attention. Bell, who is black, said he would\u2019ve handled the Brown case differently as prosecutor by appointing a special prosecutor in order to avoid any conflicts of interest. \u201cThere is a relationship between the prosecutors\u2019 office and law enforcement,\u201d Bell said. \u201cI, as a municipal court prosecutor, I work with officers all the time, some of my best friends are officers. And so there is an inherent conflict of interest because if you tell me one of my friends committed a crime, I think anyone just naturally is going to disbelieve it.\u201d Bell soundly defeated McCulloch, who is white, in a primary election on Tuesday. There is no Republican opponent in the race, and Bell will run unopposed in November.",

            "article_content": "A Ferguson city councilman appears to have defeated the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney who oversaw the controversial grand jury inquiry into the 2014 police killing of unarmed black teen Michael Brown in a Tuesday primary, according to unofficial election results. Wesley Bell would replace Robert McCulloch, who took office in 1991. A former public defender and municipal court judge, Bell, who is black, ran as a reformer and pledged to end cash bail, \u201ccreate a task force to identify factors leading to wrongful convictions\u201d and increase transparency in the system. Ferguson police report: Most shocking parts McCulloch was criticized for his handling of the investigation into Darren Wilson, the white officer who shot Brown after a brief altercation on a Ferguson street. Wilson was never charged in connection with the case, which eventually touched off a Justice Department probe that accused the police department of systematic racial bias. The Justice Department also said its investigation did not support federal civil rights charges against Wilson. There is no Republican candidate in the race, so Bell would be all but assured of taking over from McCulloch when his term ends. The unofficial election results show Bell defeating the 7-term incumbent by more than 13 points, with nearly 57% of the vote. Bell told The New York Times in an interview before the primary that if he had been in the job after Brown\u2019s killing, he would have appointed a special prosecutor. \u201cThe relationship between the prosecutor\u2019s office and law enforcement is so close,\u201d he said, \u201cand therein lies the definition of conflict of interest.\u201d In a series of tweets after the election results came in, activist DeRay Mckesson, who became a national figure during the Ferguson protests, cheered McCulloch\u2019s apparent ouster. \u201cShout-out to all of the activist and organizers who led the grassroots effort to get Wesley Bell elected,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPeople power has impact. #ByeBob\u201d This story has been updated to include additional context about the Justice Department\u2019s findings.",

            "article_content": "Melania Trump\u2019s split with her husband over NBA superstar LeBron James is the most glaring example of a growing trend: The President\u2019s family and some top officials are adopting positions at odds with his most divisive statements. The public feud between King James and the imperious President is on one level a personal and even ideological clash between two of the richest, most famous entertainers in American life whose outsize images outshine the confines of the roles they currently play. But it is also offering new insight into the President\u2019s unashamed willingness to launch attacks that touch on the most sensitive fault lines of American life, like race and freedom of expression, that even some of those closest to him find difficult to publicly defend. In recent days, Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka has said she does not share her father\u2019s view that the press is the enemy of the people, only for the President to reinterpret her remarks for his 53 million Twitter followers. Trump\u2019s counselor Kellyanne Conway echoed the comments of the President\u2019s daughter Sunday. But only after Trump reinforced his attack in a way that made his daughter\u2019s personal damage control effort last week look tame by comparison. \u201cThe Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it\u2019s TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People. They purposely cause great division & distrust. They can also cause War! They are very dangerous & sick!\u201d Trump tweeted from his vacation at his golf resort in New Jersey. In another big disconnect last week, the top intelligence and foreign policy officials delivered a stark warning about Russian election interference, only for Trump to undermine it hours later by railing against the Russia \u201choax.\u201d Trump and his administration clash over Russia The internal dynamics of the Trump family are notoriously tough to understand, and involve a complex mix of characters locked into the trust and loyalty dynamics of the most self-sufficient clans in American politics and business. It could be that Trump\u2019s wife and daughter and some top aides are fighting a battle to safeguard their own principles and beliefs within the eye of the Trump storm and carefully chose areas where they can distance themselves from the President to protect their own identities. A number of Trump\u2019s allies may also be taking steps to preserve their own reputations if they want to remain in the public eye \u2013 both in business and in politics \u2013 after the Trump presidency is over. A more cynical interpretation of the events of recent days might be that Trump\u2019s relatives and officials, by adopting more mainstream positions on certain issues, are carrying out a political strategy that can complement the President\u2019s often wild interventions to please his base. For instance, the more moderate stances of Melania and Ivanka Trump and their independent profiles could be seen as an effort to take the edge of the President\u2019s base-pleasing plays among suburban women voters, who will be crucial in the elections of 2018 and 2020. Kellyanne Conway: 'I don't believe journalists are the enemy of the people' The show of force of top national security officials at the White House last week makes it possible for the White House to argue that it does take election meddling seriously, even though it has no control over Trump\u2019s riffs on how it is all a Democratic \u201choax.\u201d Similarly, by adopting sanctions on Russia passed by Congress and allowing the sale of arms to Ukraine, the administration can argue that no White House has been tougher on Russia, despite Trump\u2019s constant and puzzling cozying up to President Vladimir Putin in public. Still, such is the belligerent dominance of Trump\u2019s personality, it\u2019s quite possible that he will simply drown out any political positioning of those around him. There is often little momentum for action in Washington if a President is not on board \u2013 one reason why many people doubt the impact of countermeasures against Russia\u2019s efforts to taint US democracy. And Trump\u2019s enemies will argue that Ivanka Trump, Melania Trump and Conway are complicit by definition in the President\u2019s rhetoric and have shown little capacity to moderate his views. The President\u2019s daughter, for instance, was at his side as he traveled to Tampa, Florida, for a Tuesday night rally in which he torched the media and his supporters jeered journalists. At the very least, their differing positions reflect the reality that the President, as the fulcrum of the administration, is now sufficiently confident in his job that he is beyond influence from those around him even if they disagree with aspects of his rhetoric. The most jarring gap between Trump and those around him emerged this weekend, after the President\u2019s attack on the newest, most famous member of the Los Angeles Lakers, who has just opened a school in Akron, Ohio, and has in the past been critical of the President\u2019s views on race. The President fired off a tweet at 10.37 p.m. ET on Friday night after CNN re-aired an interview with James. \u201cLebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made Lebron look smart, which isn\u2019t easy to do. I like Mike!\u201d Trump tweeted. Michael Jordan pushes back after Trump attacks LeBron James, Don Lemon Trump\u2019s tweet will no doubt be justified by his supporters as fair game, since James has never shied from criticizing the President. Last September for instance, James called the President a \u201cbum\u201d and said that it was a great honor for championship winning teams to go to the White House until he showed up. But the tone of Trump\u2019s tweet appeared to have troubling racial undertones. It was the latest occasion in which the President has appeared to cast doubt on the intelligence of African-American public figures. And by saying he preferred Michael Jordan to James, he was endorsing another star NBA athlete who has sometimes been criticized for not doing more in his career to highlight political, racial and social issues important to the black community. (Jordan later said through a spokeswoman that he supported James and that he\u2019s \u201cdoing an amazing job for his community,\u201d without directly addressing Trump\u2019s comment.) Criticizing James after he had been publicizing his own public service also cast Trump in a poor light. And it may have forced the first lady\u2019s hand, given that community service is at the center of her \u201cBe Best\u201d campaign. On Saturday, in the latest show of independence from the East Wing, her spokeswoman issued a statement that effectively distanced herself from her husband\u2019s remarks, even saying she would be open to visiting the school James opened. \u201cIt looks like LeBron James is working to do good things on behalf of our next generation and just as she always has, the First Lady encourages everyone to have an open dialogue about issues facing children today,\u201d said the statement issued to CNN. Trump\u2019s attacks on the media come as no surprise, and many Presidents have grumbled at their news coverage. But it\u2019s still shocking to see a President of the United States making such an unapologetic assault on the Fourth Estate as part of an apparent strategy of discrediting sources of power that contradict his own preferred versions of reality. The President fired off new shots at the media at a rally in Ohio on Saturday night in a reminder that the full-fledged assault on the press will be a centerpiece of his midterm election campaign. Last week, in an exchange with CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders refused to decry Trump\u2019s mantra that the press is the enemy of the people, a statement that for many observers on both sides of the political spectrum has authoritarian overtones. But Conway, who had a strong media profile before joining Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016 and joining him in the White House, took the opportunity to put her views on the record Sunday, while being careful not to openly criticize the President. She said she thought the President was referring to \u201csome reporters\u201d who she said \u201caren\u2019t always telling the truth.\u201d But she later added as she walked a rhetorical tightrope, \u201cI don\u2019t believe journalists are the enemy of the people.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kate Bennett contributed to this report.",

After his standard caveats \u2013 he says it\u2019s something he needs to talk about with his family and won\u2019t actually decide on until early 2019 \u2013 a confident Holder leaned in. \u201cAm I interested it?\u201d he asked. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m interested!\u201d Holder, the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official for six years under former President Barack Obama, has been publicly ruminating about a presidential run for months. His standard stump speech is littered with criticism of the Republicans in power. And with the Democratic field to take on President Donald Trump in 2020 wide open, Holder \u2013 along with former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 could credibly claim the closest ties to the last Democratic president, a potent rallying point for a party in search of a standard-bearer. Holder, who has traveled the country as head of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and raised money for Democrats in about a dozen states, has been up front about a potential presidential run, and his busy schedule has Democrats taking notice \u2013 especially when his travels take him to states key to a presidential election. Holder\u2019s travels have taken him to Arizona, Indiana and Ohio for state Democratic Party dinners, as well as Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida and Georgia for events and meetings with local activists. Holder\u2019s meetings generally focus on combating gerrymandering, his cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre since leaving the Obama administration, but his events are often peppered with politics and \u2013 invariably \u2013 comments about his future. Few Democrats want to draw the scrutiny that will come with being out in front of the 2020 race, and Holder is no different. While he often acknowledges his aspirations when he gets asked about 2020, he also says he is more focused on what he thinks a presidential candidate needs than on his own future. \u201c(We need) somebody who has the vision for the job, somebody who has got the necessary experience, somebody who has the capacity, physical as well as mental,\u201d Holder told CNN during a trip to New Hampshire in June. \u201cSomebody who also has the ability to inspire people, to make people believe government can be the force for good and make people believe in this thing we call America. (They) have to be able to move people, to bring up together in ways this President has clearly not done.\u201d Over the last two months, though, Holder has appeared to move closer to running. And on Thursday in Columbus, Ohio, the former attorney general bluntly told CNN that he thinks he has what it takes. \u201cI think that I am OK when it comes to those five criteria where I set up,\u201d Holder said with a confidence that friends and former colleagues says is a trademark. \u201cBut there is a personal component to it as well. People say it, but it really is true. It is a familial thing: I have kids; I have got a wife who is going to help be a part of this decision. That is for next year.\u201d Former Obama AG Eric Holder says he'll decide on a 2020 presidential bid by early next year The question Democrats are now asking: Is Holder the best person to take on Trump? In early states Holder has visited, like New Hampshire and Ohio, Democrats have been impressed with his fundraising ability (his redistricting organization has raised $29 million since it was founded in 2017), his charisma in small events and the staff he has assembled around him. \u201cThere are certainly a significant number of folks that would like to see him run,\u201d New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair Ray Buckley said after his June visit. \u201cIt will be a tough decision by the 24, 36 of them because how do you differentiate yourself from the crowd? What we learned from Trump is that you really have to stand out or you risk not being recognized.\u201d Rob Richardson, the Democratic candidate for Ohio treasurer, said Holder is \u201claying the groundwork\u201d and, most notably, not knocking down speculation. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t said no,\u201d Richardson said. \u201cThat usually is the clearest indication.\u201d Holder\u2019s run would undoubtedly be unique \u2013 no US attorney general has gone on to be President \u2013 and the former Obama official knows he would likely face a field of possibly two dozen other Democrats competing to take on Trump \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be involved or do something simply to make a statement,\u201d he said. \u201cI would only decide to get involved if I thought I could win.\u201d And it was clear on Thursday during a criminal justice reform roundtable that Holder sees that any path to victory goes directly through his record and ties to the Obama administration. \u201cI am very proud of the work I have done in the Obama administration, and I think that will galvanize a lot of support, were I to make that decision,\u201d Holder said. \u201cAnd I think it is the work that I did in the Obama administration (that) will hopefully give me a platform to support candidates.\u201d Obama and Holder speak regularly about the redistricting committee, an effort that the former President has championed since leaving the White House, aides to both men say. Whether Obama has advised Holder to run for President is another question \u2013 and something Holder wouldn\u2019t disclose. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that my conversations with the President are my conversations with the President,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have talked.\u201d Although the two are personally close and Democrats who meet Holder invariably compare the two, their styles are markedly different. Where Obama became well known for sweeping rhetoric, Holder\u2019s appearances are more muted, wonky and a far cry from the fiery rhetoric and brash partisanship that has played out in Washington. Obama also burst onto the scene with little history but some electoral victories, while Holder has spent most of his life as a government official who, especially while working under Obama, incensed Republicans. Holder, who has a constant self-confidence about him, seems to relish the fact that his mere presence annoys some on the right and admitted that a hypothetical run would send some on the right spinning. And it seems likely that he hopes he could provoke Trump as he did House Republicans. Holder leaves door wide open to White House run During his two days in Ohio, Holder accused Trump of not moving the country forward, rolling back priorities solely because they had an association with the Obama administration and using his campaign to bring out latent \u201cmisogyny, homophobia, racism.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s be frank about this. There is a racial component to this,\u201d he said of Trump. \u201cA lot of the issues that Trump presented as economic issues were actually economic issues with a racial core.\u201d Holder often does far more listening than speaking at events, including one where he gathered with Ohio gubernatorial candidate Richard Cordray, lieutenant governor candidate Betty Sutton and a dozen African-American activists to discuss criminal justice reform. And his answers generally focus more on policy than politics. But his wonkiness at times makes way for a playfulness about Trump and a 2020 run. \u201cTwo guys from Queens,\u201d Holder said earlier this year, setting up a rhetorical race against Trump. \u201cThat would be interesting. New Yorkers know how to talk to other New Yorkers.\u201d And when a member of the Hamilton County Young Democrats asked Holder about motivating young people, he joked about his age \u2013 he\u2019s 67 years old \u2013 and what motivated Obama supporters. \u201cYou should be the most concerned, because the reality is I am in the end of the third quarter of this thing we call life,\u201d he said to laughs, before reminiscing about \u201cmagical\u201d 2008, when  Obama and his \u201cbeautiful\u201d family was seen as \u201chip\u201d and \u201ccool\u201d before they won the White House. After the event, as he made his way to raise money for yet another Democratic hopeful, Holder \u2013 bravado fully apparent \u2013 joked that he was just as cool, if not cooler, than his close friend. \u201cI am definitely cool, and I am definitely hip and I am from New York City,\u201d he said to laughs from his aides. \u201cSo I check all those boxes.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Jason Lewis has repeatedly demeaned recipients of welfare and government assistance, calling them \u201cparasites\u201d and \u201cscoundrels,\u201d and said the black community had \u201ctraded one plantation for another.\u201d Lewis made the comments on a conservative radio show he hosted, \u201cThe Jason Lewis Show,\u201d from 2009 to 2012. CNN\u2019s KFile previously reported that Lewis made racist comments about African-Americans and lamented not being able to call women \u201csluts\u201d on his program. The Minnesota congressman\u2019s extreme rhetoric in his previous job, which he described as rooted in libertarianism, also included calling the part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that applied to private businesses \u201cunconstitutional\u201d as well as calling the Americans with Disabilities Act \u201cone of the worst\u201d laws and suggesting that it might be the cause of workplace shootings. He also said religious freedom laws didn\u2019t \u201cgo far in enough in allowing discrimination.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile obtained the audio recording from MinnPost columnist and former deputy chair of the Republican Party of Minnesota Michael Brodkorb, who previously posted some comments from Lewis\u2019 show in a column in February 2016. KFile contacted Brodkorb after seeing his 2016 column and requested raw audio files of Lewis\u2019 show, which he provided. GOP congressman said blacks have 'entitlement mentality' and view themselves as victims \u201cCNN is free to focus on past rhetoric instead of Congressman Lewis\u2019 record in Congress, and they will no doubt continue to ignore the substance of the arguments, but it does little to add to the debate,\u201d Lewis\u2019 spokeswoman Becky Alery told CNN. Lewis was narrowly elected to represent Minnesota\u2019s 2nd District in 2016 and is considered one of the most endangered House Republicans in the midterm election. CNN rates the race as a \u201ctoss up,\u201d the most competitive designation. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that he doesn\u2019t support Lewis\u2019 prior comments, but said Lewis is different as a lawmaker than he was as a \u201cshock jock.\u201d He would not call on him to apologize. On his radio show in September 2012, Lewis explained why he thought then-President Barack Obama was leading Mitt Romney in election polls, saying Democrats were supported by \u201cparasites\u201d on government assistance. \u201cI\u2019m trying to explain to you how President Barack Obama could be in the lead in some of these polls. When the economy is flat on its back. When you and I see the welfare state in all of its wonderful manifestations and yet he\u2019s still leading in Ohio, he\u2019s still leading in Florida. How is this possible? It is possible because the Democratic dream come true is this: The parasites outnumber the producers. Then, when the parasites outnumber the producers, the party of parasites will give the majority of votes.\u201d Lewis made his comments on the day a video was released which showed then-candidate Romney saying that nearly half of Americans would vote for Obama because they rely on the government. Lewis defended Romney, saying, \u201cMitt Romney\u2019s in trouble because he said on a tape that Obama voters are dependent on government? Excuse me, excuse me? You\u2019re damn right they\u2019re dependent on government and that\u2019s the strategy of the socialist left since day one. It is to get everybody on a government program.\u201d \u201cHis only error was he probably guessed too low,\u201d Lewis would later say. In the same September 2012 episode, Lewis said that Democratic voters were on government aid, calling them \u201cunpatriotic\u201d and \u201cscoundrels\u201d looking for more government handouts. \u201cThe government class, the Obama voters, as Romney correctly says in this breathtaking new audio, who are dependent on government, are selling out the country. They are unpatriotic, they\u2019re scoundrels, they are selling out my generation and your generation and your children\u2019s generation, so they can get their benefits today,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe idiot voters out there, those who are dependent on the government, addicted to the government and they can rip off their neighbors by voting for Al Franken,\u201d he added, referring to the then-Democratic senator from Minnesota. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand they\u2019re ripping off themselves.\u201d In another episode, Lewis compared being on welfare to being enslaved, arguing that the welfare state had \u201csubstituted one plantation for another.\u201d \u201cIt is hard to overestimate the damage \u2013 go back to Martin Luther King and the struggle for black equality \u2013 where blacks, in our sorry history, I mean, this really is a blemish on the American dream or the American experience \u2013 blacks fought so hard, indeed, and alongside a number of whites, thankfully, who fought so hard so blacks could take care of themselves and not be told what to do,\u201d Lewis said in April 2012. \u201cNow, you\u2019ve got the modern welfare state that tells black folks and Hispanic folks and poor white folks: \u2018Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019ll take care of you.\u2019 What is the difference? You\u2019ve substituted one plantation for another.\u201d A GOP congressman once lamented not being able to call women 'sluts' anymore Lewis\u2019 rhetoric wasn\u2019t limited to just government assistance. Lewis also pushed an extreme view on laws like the the 1964 Civil Rights Act, Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. During a September 2011 broadcast, Lewis spoke to a black caller who criticized Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential candidate, for voting against the Civil Rights Act, which led Lewis to defend Goldwater and argue that of parts of the law were unconstitutional. \u201cNobody \u2013 and besides, The Civil Rights Act of 1964, nobody \u2014 I frankly do think there are portions of it that were unconstitutional depending on your view of, of private contracts,\u201d Lewis said, before going on to criticize parts of the act that banned discrimination in private businesses and organizations. \u201cThe administration could not constitutionally get that by any court in the country based on the Equal Protection clause of the 14th Amendment, the Equal Protection clause, the part of the Civil War amendments that said, \u2018no state shall discriminate or deny someone equal protection of the law.\u2019 Now nobody\u2019s opposed to that including me, Goldwater or anybody else, and certainly you, but that applied to what the state did. It did not apply to private discrimination.\u201d In another episode on a 2015 podcast, Lewis criticized desegregation busing. He made his comments when predicting that, in the future, neighborhoods would have racial quotas. \u201cIf you live in a neighborhood that zones one acre lots, well that keeps out too many Hispanics, that\u2019s got to be discriminatory,\u201d Lewis said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to sue you and they\u2019re amassing this database to literally enforce forced housing. You thought forced busing was bad. You ain\u2019t seen nothing.\u201d In a similar vein, Lewis criticized the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the civil rights law that prohibits discrimination based on disability. In a September 2012 broadcast, he compared it to Jim Crow. \u201cNow the government determines who you shall hire, who you should work next to, and when you\u2019re going to be thrown in jail or fined civilly for refusing to employ or serve or do whatever the government says you ought to do,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe irony of this is the last time we tried this was during Jim Crow when the government used to mandate segregation.\u201d Lewis went on to say that the law was one of the worst. \u201cThe economy is stifled under an anarchy of laws of rules; Dodd Frank, Obamacare, the EPA, environmental laws, OSHA, you name it, not to mention antidiscrimination laws, and the ADA is one of the worst.\u201d Later, in the same episode, Lewis continued to criticize the Americans with Disabilities Act, and blamed the law for an increase in workplace shootings. \u201cBecause of the ADA, we have eviscerated the notion of fair play and in the process in these workplace shootings, I have the temerity today, the audacity, to suggest that that is partly responsible for these workplace shootings. In every single instance, the person had a history of mental, mental illness, something set them off and they go bonkers and kill people. So why did we not screen those people out?\u201d Lewis\u2019 comments blaming the law for mass shootings came in response to news of a workplace shooting earlier in the day in Minneapolis that left six people dead. In a blog post, written on his personal website in 2015, Lewis argued that Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act didn\u2019t go far enough in allowing private discrimination. \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing wrong with Indiana\u2019s (or anyone else\u2019s) Religious Freedom & Restoration Act (RFRA): it doesn\u2019t go far in enough in allowing discrimination,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is, why should you have to invoke a religious exemption in order to freely determine with whom you want to associate? I might not want to hire you because your \u2018lifestyle\u2019 (gay or straight) violates the tenants of my company\u2019s religious beliefs (the Supreme Court upheld Hobby Lobby\u2019s decision not to offer contraceptives for the same reason), but I also might not want to employ you because your ears are large. The former is protected by RFRA, the latter is not. Why?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Jason Lewis has a long history of racist rhetoric about African-Americans, pushing claims of a \u201cracial war\u201d by blacks on whites and arguing that violence regularly occurs at black gatherings. He also frequently claimed that black people have an \u201centitlement mentality\u201d and viewed themselves as victims. Lewis made those comments on \u201cThe Jason Lewis Show,\u201d a syndicated radio program Lewis hosted from 2009 until 2014 with the tagline \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mr. Right.\u201d CNN\u2019s KFile obtained five months of audio from Michael Brodkorb, the former deputy chair of the Republican Party of Minnesota. Brodkorb, who is currently a columnist for the MinnPost and works in public affairs, initially reported on several comments from Lewis in 2016. KFile contacted Brodkorb to request the raw audio files of Lewis\u2019 show, which he provided. CNN\u2019s KFile reported on Wednesday that Lewis made a large number of deeply misogynistic comments on the show, including one monologue in which he lamented not being able to call women \u201csluts\u201d anymore. Rep. Jason Lewis stands by 'sluts' comments: 'I was paid to be provocative' Narrowly elected to represent Minnesota\u2019s 2nd District in 2016, Lewis is now considered one of the most endangered House Republicans in the midterm election. CNN rates the race as a \u201ctoss up,\u201d the most competitive designation. In a statement to CNN on Friday, Lewis\u2019 office said highlighting the congressman\u2019s past statements amounted to \u201can orchestrated attempt at making anyone who supports reducing illegitimacy or crime in minority communities, Voter ID laws and work requirements for public assistance back off their public policy positions.\u201d On his radio show in 2012, Lewis, who has described himself as libertarian Republican, regularly expressed a belief that African-Americans had an \u201centitlement mentality,\u201d leading to violence in the community. \u201cThere\u2019s a cultural problem in the African-American community that is leading to this. The entitlement mentality,\u201d Lewis said in December 2012. \u201cYou\u2019re a victim. It\u2019s OK to hate women, beat up women. It\u2019s OK to hate gays. All this, we\u2019re just sort of feeding this to people who are very lost because of the breakdown of society to begin with.\u201d That same month, Lewis added the welfare state has in some ways been worse for the black community than Jim Crow, calling black people \u201caddicted\u201d to government programs. \u201cWhat the welfare state has done to the black community, a hundred years of racism could not do,\u201d he said. \u201cA hundred years of racism could not break it up, it could not destroy black families. Jim Crow could not do it. But what dependency has done, is has caused unwanted pregnancy, illegitimacy. It has told young black males that they are dispensable, they don\u2019t need to hang around when mom needs support or whatever and it has destroyed \u2013 and not just black communities, but any urban community, and so what you\u2019ve got here is now they\u2019re addicted. Large swaths of Hispanic communities, black communities are addicted to these, these subsidies.\u201d Lewis also asserted on an August 2012 broadcast that there tended to be trouble at black social gatherings \u2013 and that the same could not be said about other social groups. \u201cI happen to think actually that the modern welfare state has really devastated African-American communities, minority communities by making certain that young black males are raised by one parent, not holding fathers accountable,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve added sort of gasoline to the fire of poverty. Now you\u2019ve got young men with no way to express themselves in a proper way, so violence begets violence and the cycle keeps going on and on and on.\u201d Comedian to congressman: Go ahead and call us sluts He went on to say, \u201cYou simply can\u2019t say the same thing about other groups. But when there is a festival, a gathering, call it what you will \u2013 June ninth, Juneteenth or urban weekend in Miami Beach or Myrtle Beach and Indianapolis. When there is a predominantly black festival, there\u2019s trouble.\u201d Earlier that year in March, Lewis made a similar point in saying that \u201cwhitey\u201d did not riot over OJ Simpson\u2019s acquittal. \u201cWhere were the throngs of lily white people in their Lacoste tennis shoes when OJ Simpson got off and everybody knew the man was guilty?\u201d added Lewis. \u201cI\u2019m not speaking out of turn. Isn\u2019t he in jail right about now or was? But regardless, where were the protests? Where was whitey going, \u2018no justice, no peace.\u2019 The Goldman family was outraged. They held some interviews. There wasn\u2019t a threat to community violence or civil disobedience. Why not? That was a travesty of the criminal justice system. That was a joke. OJ didn\u2019t even have a jury of his peers.\u201d \u201cI can guarantee you why these murder rates are going up in these cities and it\u2019s urban violence. It\u2019s predominantly minority on minority, but where\u2019s the protest over that?\u201d added Lewis. On the same broadcast, Lewis cited the book \u201cWhite Girl Bleed A Lot\u201d by far-right commentator Colin Flaherty, also the author of the book, \u201cDon\u2019t Make the Black Kids Angry.\u201d The congressman used Flaherty\u2019s book to support his theory that white people are \u201cthe real victims of racial violence.\u201d \u201cRacial violence is all the media rage, but the elephant in the living room is they have it wrong. The real victims of most racial violence are not are not members of the minorities in America. They are white people,\u201d the Minnesota congressman said. \u201cUnfortunately, and this is documented fairly well in this new book, White Girl Bleed A Lot, The Return of Racial Violence, the author Colin Flaherty, an award-winning journalist based out east, as you have heard now.\u201d Lewis went on to say that the book was \u201cnot something that\u2019s easy to stomach, because it is a tragic tale of more flash mobs, of more black-on-white violence, of more racial hatred and it\u2019s not being reported except here.\u201d Some reviewers called the book\u2019s portrayal of the frequency of black-on-white crime misleading and accused it of inciting racism against black teenagers. According to Bureau of Justice statistics, the rates of black-on-white violent crime and white-on-black crime between the years 2012 and 2015 were extremely similar, with the former being 3.1 per 1,000 white people and the latter being 2.8 per 1,000 black people. For the vast majority of violent crimes during those years, the victim and offender were of the same race. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to suggest that that somehow I\u2019ve got these horrible attitudes or because you were engaged in a provocative radio talk show, even though your record in Congress is very mainstream \u2013 Gov Track, puts me as a moderate,\u201d Lewis told CNN\u2019s KFile on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m working with (Democratic Rep.) Bobby Scott on criminal justice reform. I wrote a number of op-eds over the years questioning the efficacy of the drug war and specifically citing its impact on minority communities. My actual record is, is fairly clear. So when you take a quote in the context of a rhetorical discussion and put it in a headline that\u2019s even worse \u2013 I do think that\u2019s out of context.\u201d During his radio career, Lewis repeatedly returned to the subject of black-on-white crime, warning in December 2012 of a \u201cracial war.\u201d \u201cAnother thing the media is ignoring that\u2019s the return of race riots in America, in Chicago, in Philadelphia, and all across the fruited plain, there is a racial war going on,\u201d he said. \u201cRemember when we interviewed Colin Flaherty, author of a White Girl Bleed A Lot, where he documents, from Minneapolis to Portland to Miami to Philadelphia, the violent racial crime that\u2019s going on, and most of it black on white, but the media choose to ignore that as well. Now, no one can discount the horrible legacy of slavery. No one can discount the sin of America\u2019s past \u2013 but the chances today, and I want to be clear about this, I know it\u2019s provocative, but I want to be clear \u2013 the chances today of a gang of KKK members beating up a black kid are remote compared to the opposite. A gang of black on white crime.\u201d \u201cNone of them are being reported by the mainstream media,\u201d he would add. \u201cNo left wing violence whatsoever, no aggrieved victim violence. You know the usual victim groups, gays, minority members, union members, the poor you name. They\u2019re next to godliness. Now, nobody wants to trade places with people who are impoverished, but that doesn\u2019t countenance violence and it\u2019s happening all over the country and nobody\u2019s reporting on it.\u201d A GOP congressman once lamented not being able to call women 'sluts' anymore Lewis had previously warned of a potential \u201crace war\u201d in April 2012 after the shooting of Trayvon Martin. On that show, the congressman argued that \u201coverreaction\u201d to the shooting \u201cby the civil rights establishment,\u201d such as Al Sharpton, had brought the country to the \u201cverge of a race war.\u201d He then went on to say that the opposition of Sharpton and others to stricter voter ID laws was \u201cthe same sort of hyperventilation that has brought Florida to the edge of a race war.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have a photo ID to get on an airplane, you\u2019ve got to have a photo ID to take a college test, you\u2019ve got to have a photo ID to cash a check and yet (then-US Attorney General) Eric Holder is rejecting the Texas voter identification laws. He\u2019s stopping the South Carolina voter identification laws. Why?\u201d Lewis said. \u201cBecause he and (Jesse) Jackson and Sharpton are once again bringing out the race card in photo ID\u2013saying what? Saying that having a photo ID requirement at the polls is inherently \u2013 are you ready?\u2013racist. Now this is the same sort of stretch, this is the same sort of hyperventilation that has brought Florida to the edge of a race war and now it\u2019s coming from the white side as well as the black side, tragically. Extremists on both sides.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former US President Barack Obama mounted a passionate defense of democracy and warned against the rise of \u201cstrongman politics,\u201d in a speech in South Africa a day after his successor, Donald Trump, was heavily criticized for a humiliating news conference with Vladimir Putin. In an address Tuesday in honor of the late Nelson Mandela ahead of the 100th anniversary of his birth, Obama criticized populist movements toward authoritarianism around the world and ridiculed the \u201cutter loss of shame among political leaders\u201d who lie. READ: Obama's full speech about the 'politics of fear and resentment' Obama has made an art of criticizing the current President\u2019s values without explicitly naming Trump, peppering his speech Tuesday with warnings against some of Trump\u2019s key policies, including protectionism, climate change denial and closed borders. \u201cThe politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment began to appear. And that kind of politics is now on the move. It\u2019s on the move at a pace that would have seemed unimaginable just a few years ago,\u201d he told the crowd of around 15,000 people in Johannesburg. \u201cI am not being alarmist, I\u2019m simply stating the facts. Look around \u2014 strongman politics are ascendant, suddenly, whereby elections and some pretense of democracy are maintained, the form of it, where those in powers seek to undermine every institution or norm that gives democracy meaning.\u201d Obama\u2019s remarks come a day after Trump\u2019s news conference in Helsinki, Finland, in which the US leader sided with Putin over his own country\u2019s intelligence agencies on whether Russia interfered in the 2016 US election. Trump had been expected by some observers to confront Putin over the issue after the US Department of Justice indicted 12 Russians, accused of hacking the Democrat\u2019s emails and computer networks to target Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. Trump and Putin are pulling the West apart The President flip-flopped on his stance on the matter, having said last year he believed Russia was behind the interference, but back-pedaling Monday to claim he believed Putin\u2019s account that Russia was not involved. Obama mocked the way politicians lie and reminded his audience of the importance of facts. \u201cYou have to believe in facts. Without facts there\u2019s no basis for cooperation. If I say this is a podium and you say this is an elephant, it\u2019s going to be hard for us to cooperate,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t find common ground if somebody says that climate change just isn\u2019t happening, when almost all the world\u2019s scientists tell us it is. I don\u2019t know where to start talking to you about this. If you say it\u2019s an elaborate hoax, where do we start?\u201d He added that politics today often rejected the concept of objective truth. \u201cPeople just make stuff up. They just make stuff up. We see it in the growth of state sponsored propaganda. We see it in internet fabrications. We see it in the blurring of lines between news and entertainment. We see the utter loss of shame among political leaders where they\u2019re caught in a lie and they just double down and they lie some more. It used to be that if you caught them lying, they\u2019d be like, oh man \u2013 now they just keep on lying,\u201d he said, to laughter in the crowd. Obama had opened his speech reflecting on the recent chaos of the world that gave him the opportunity to seek perspective. \u201cBut in the strange and uncertain times that we are in \u2013 and they are strange, and they are uncertain, with each day\u2019s news cycles bringing more head-spinning and disturbing headlines \u2013 I thought maybe it would be useful to step back for a moment and try to get some perspective, so I hope you\u2019ll indulge me,\u201d he said. He warned that the press was under attack, that censorship and state control of media is on the rise and that social media was being used to promote hate, propaganda and conspiracy theories. \u201cSo, on Madiba\u2019s 100 birthday, we now stand at a crossroads,\u201d he said, using a clan name of affection for Mandela. He said that there was a choice between two visions of humanity\u2019s future that the world must choose between. \u201cHow should we respond? Should we see that wave of hope that we felt with Madiba\u2019s release from prison? From the Berlin Wall coming down? Should we see that hope that we had as na\u00efve and misguided?\u201d he asked. \u201cLet me tell you what I believe. I believe in Nelson Mandela\u2019s vision, I believe in a vision shared by Gandhi and King, and Abraham Lincoln, I believe in a vision of equality and justice and freedom and multi-racial democracy built on the premise that all people are created equal and are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights.\u201d Obama\u2019s speech, the 16th annual Nelson Mandela Lecture, is one of his highest-profile appearances and his first return to Africa since he left office in 2017. His lecture, titled \u201cRenewing the Mandela legacy and promoting active citizenship in a changing world,\u201d tracked the transformation of the world, particularly in terms of race relations and human rights, over the past 100 years. \u201cIt is a plain fact that racial discrimination still exists in both the United States and South Africa,\u201d he said. Obama\u2019s speech followed remarks by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and Mandela\u2019s widow, Gra\u00e7a Machel, formerly a freedom fighter and minister in Mozambique\u2019s government. Machel drew several parallels between Mandela and Obama, portraying them both as modest men as \u201csymbols of victory over adversity.\u201d \u201cFrom the humblest of beginnings, they are representatives of the masses and reached to the pinnacle of power and influence. But in doing so they were able to elevate the rights and ambitions of the disenfranchised and the weak. Of young and old, of both men and women, of black and white,\u201d she said of both leaders. Ramaphosa said South Africans celebrated Obama because he shared similar leadership qualities as Mandela and had the same ability to inspire hope and action. Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. He helped South Africa break the practice of racial segregation and do away with white minority rule. Imprisoned for nearly three decades for his fight against state-sanctioned racial segregation, he was freed in 1990 and quickly set about working to unite the nation through forgiveness and reconciliation, becoming South Africa\u2019s first black president. Obama, who became the US\u2019 first black president in 2009, has referred to Mandela as a mentor. CNN\u2019s David McKenzie and Brent Swails reported from Johannesburg, and Angela Dewan reported from London. Journalist Rory Smith contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A little less than a year ago, the Democratic Socialists of America met for their biennial convention in relative obscurity. Some 800 delegates, gathered in Chicago for a long summer weekend, discussed ways to build on their Trump-era membership surge and, in sometimes-pitched debates, wrestled with how deeply to engage in the 2018 midterm campaign season. The election of socialists was settled on as one of three national political priorities, with a pledge that the organization \u201cwill concentrate its scarce national electoral resources on supporting chapters that are campaigning for open socialists who are running as Greens, independents, or in partisan Democratic primaries.\u201d Since then, candidates backed by Democratic Socialists of America chapters around the country have won up and down the ballot, from the Virginia state House of Delegates in 2017 to this year\u2019s Pennsylvania state House primaries and in New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District, where Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old first-time candidate, defeated Rep. Joe Crowley, a 10-term incumbent who\u2019s one of the most powerful Democrats on Capitol Hill. The excitement surrounding Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s June stunner spurred another spike in dues-paying members \u2013 the group now has more than 45,000 nationally, according to a spokesman \u2013 and set off a torrent of interest (and opinion) from both mainstream Democratic and Republican politicos. In an interview, Democratic Socialists of America National Director Maria Svart discussed with CNN the group\u2019s agenda, why it will not become a political party anytime soon and where independent Sen. Bernie Sanders fits in all of this. This interview has been edited and condensed. President Trump\u2019s victory in 2016 led to a surge in dues-paying DSA members. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s victory was another watershed. Just recently we\u2019re seeing candidates like Cynthia Nixon identify as democratic socialists \u2013 and actively seek DSA\u2019s support. If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s driving this surge, what do you think it is? People want to live with dignity and comfort and that\u2019s not working with the economic system we have now. People see things happening to them. Something happens in the economy and they get laid off from their job. Or some politician makes some decision and they lose their health benefits or their community is disinvested in. Democratic socialism speaks to people\u2019s fears and anger and offers a positive vision. We remind people of the power of collective action and we help people overcome the isolation and loneliness that they experience and that sense of powerlessness. We believe that only we, working class people or poor people, have the power to make that happen \u2013 and that\u2019s just resonating with folks. What is the fundamental difference between the politics of DSA and someone like Bernie Sanders? Well, we have one foot inside the Democratic Party and one foot outside the Democratic Party in the same way we have one foot inside electoral politics and one foot outside. Our vision is to build a mass, multi-racial, working-class movement that brings people together across our differences and demands that our society and our economy be run democratically. Most of us believe that this will not work under capitalism. Our north star is totally transforming the system, even though our immediate vision and our immediate political program is similar to Bernie Sanders\u2019. What\u2019s different is we want to democratize everything, ultimately. That\u2019s the goal. Right, but do people really understand that? There\u2019s a lot of buzz around DSA right now, a lot of excitement on the campaign trail and always on social media. Does that interest line up with a legit understanding of what democratic socialism is? That thing we have to remember is that we hear from the capitalist class every day in the mainstream media. We are surrounded by sexist, racist, homophobic ideas, nationalist and capitalist ideas. It is a total paradigm shift for people when all of it comes together \u2013 and these unfair things in the world make sense. So it\u2019s not a surprise that a lot of people experience unfairness and want something different, even if they haven\u2019t thought through exactly how the capitalist economy works. That\u2019s why we have an organization. We argue with each other. We read our history. We read political philosophy, we talk to people at their doors and on the streets and, together, we make sense of the world. That\u2019s one of the benefits of DSA and that\u2019s why we love the rapid growth. Because people are coming into a community where they grapple with these questions. DSA is not a political party. Why not? In the US, there are institutional barriers, structural barriers (for any new party). But we also want to maintain the flexibility of being within the left wing of the Democratic Party, but also being outside of it. We see our role now as shifting the Overton window \u2013 shifting the acceptable discourse, while also organizing people and building concrete power with a politically aware grassroots base that understands who the enemy is and is willing to hold politicians accountable. But that flexibility is important. Right, but some people in the organization \u2013 dues-paying members \u2013 want to change that. When you\u2019re face-to-face, what do you tell them? That we make choices about what we do based on our understanding of the concrete reality. And our understanding of the concrete reality right now is that trying to build a party outside of the Democrats and Republicans is very difficult because of the barriers those two parties have put in place. And the barriers that the capitalist class has put in front of working people and poor people, who vote at very low rates because there are deliberate barriers put in their place. So many people in DSA do want to build a third party, but we also know that you can\u2019t do that without an organized base. And we\u2019re not there yet. In its current form, DSA grapples really hard with how and where to get involved in elections. How do you weigh the opportunity that comes with helping and shaping a successful campaign against maintaining a kind of ideological purity? Obviously it\u2019s a balancing act. That\u2019s why we do constant political education with our members and constant organizing to grow and be in touch with working and poor people in our communities. We need that organized base to hold us accountable \u2013 to hold the politicians that we\u2019re helping accountable. But we fundamentally believe that as working people we become more empowered the more we exercise our power. And the more visible it is that there are a few greedy people who rigged our economy, then point the finger at immigrants or disabled people or other vulnerable people, the more likely people are to have some clarity about our political strategy. Is that frustrating, though, not being able to occasionally point to a candidate somewhere and say, \u201cListen, this person is great and supporting them would be hugely helpful in helping us accomplish the fundamental things we all want\u201d? No, because people need to grapple with tough questions and they are not going to be invested in the results unless they make the decisions. We believe very deeply in a democratic process and that, in the end, we\u2019ll come out stronger (by adhering to it). Looking over some election wins by people on the left this year and last \u2013 they\u2019ve been mostly by people of color, often women, and in minority-majority communities or something close to it. What does that say to you about the left more broadly? To me it says that the \u201cBernie bro\u201d narrative is highly overblown by the interests of people that want to maintain the Democratic Party the way it is now. They want to undermine the political narrative and policy agenda of Bernie Sanders, even though he\u2019s the most popular Democratic politician across demographic groups. So it\u2019s this ideological program to minimize Sanders based on identity, while ignoring class. And the reason that the candidates that we have endorsed that have been winning elections are not the typical \u201cBernie bro\u201d stereotype is that it\u2019s a construction and a narrative that is intended to hide the reality, which is these politics speak to all working people. That in mind, DSA has traditionally attracted mostly white guys. As the organization\u2019s leader, what are you doing to make it a welcoming place for women who share your politics? Personally, I try to serve as a mentor to women in the organization and model the kind of behavior that we want. But it\u2019s the structural things that really matter: the quotas on our national board, having a socialist feminist working group. I\u2019m not just a proud socialist feminist who talks about it all the time; I\u2019m making sure that we have a national committee that can engage in campaigns like the national fundraising \u201cBowl-a-thon\u201d that we do every year in solidarity with the National Network of Abortion Funds. This year we raised almost $100,000 for abortion funds across the country to directly pay for women that can\u2019t afford to get a safe abortion. So supporting the kind of programming that will lift up women\u2019s struggles and highlighting the fact that things like the teachers\u2019 strikes in West Virginia and other states were led by women, and (talking about) the individual burden on women of bearing and caring for children and taking care of the elderly. We feel all the tremendous pressure on us individually and then the capitalist class benefits because they don\u2019t have to pay for universal elder care and they don\u2019t have to pay for universal child care. So I make a point of talking about that and working to make sure that our political education activities speak to that. But I will say that naturally a lot of women and people of color in DSA get involved in leadership and have become some of our strongest leaders.",

            "article_content": "Since President Donald Trump nominated him Monday night, critics have been jousting over where exactly nominee Brett Kavanaugh would fit on the Supreme Court\u2019s ideological spectrum. But no matter where he falls among justices on the right wing, two things are certain: He is no Anthony Kennedy. And he is ready. Where Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stands on key issues Over his dozen years on the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Kavanaugh has shown a more confident conservatism than Justice Kennedy, the 30-year veteran he would succeed. Kavanaugh takes a high-altitude approach, espousing broad constitutional principles. As a result, he stands to be more than just a reliable vote for the right. He could powerfully influence the country\u2019s legal agenda for decades. Kavanaugh\u2019s writings already have been cited in Supreme Court rulings, as in a 2013 decision preventing certain US lawsuits against foreign corporations alleged to be responsible for human-rights abuses abroad and a 2015 decision stopping the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating mercury emissions from coal-fired plants without taking account of costs. Having navigated Washington\u2019s corridors of power since the 1990s, Kavanaugh, 53 and known for his personable ways, could also be more persuasive with his colleagues than other new justices. Kavanaugh\u2019s hard-line conservative record, compared with that of retiring centrist-conservative Kennedy, would mean diminished individual rights for women and minorities, affecting access to abortion and opportunities for racial affirmative action. On larger questions involving government power, a new Justice Kavanaugh could mean further reining in of environmental regulations and consumer protection. Based on past his past writings, Kavanaugh would also bolster the power and prerogatives of the President \u2013 an area likely to elicit particular Senate attention because of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election and ties to the Trump campaign. Trump says he hasn't brought up issue of abortion with Supreme Court pick Many justices in recent years have been elevated from the powerful DC Circuit, which handles important disputes over government power, but only Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s tenure rivaled Kavanaugh\u2019s. She served for 13 years on the DC Circuit before President Bill Clinton in 1993 named her to the high court. Kavanaugh\u2019s opinions reflect a well-developed approach to curtailing regulatory authority as well as narrowing individual civil rights. \u201cThis is a case about executive power and individual liberty,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote earlier this year as he dissented from an opinion by the full DC Circuit upholding the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, run by a single director. \u201cTo prevent tyranny and protect individual liberty, the Framers of the Constitution separated the legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the new national government,\u201d he continued. Independent agencies, he added, are \u201ca headless fourth branch of the U.S. Government (that) hold enormous power over the economic and social life of the United States.\u201d When he dissented from a DC Circuit decision last October preventing the Trump administration from blocking a teenage migrant in Texas from obtaining an abortion, Kavanaugh laced his opinion with broader thoughts. He stressed that the \u201cgovernment has permissible interests in favoring fetal life, protecting the best interests of a minor, and refraining from facilitating abortion.\u201d Kavanaugh endorsed the administration\u2019s effort to block the procedure, at least until the girl could obtain a sponsor, a process that could have taken weeks and made it more difficult to terminate the pregnancy. (The majority position allowed the girl to immediately obtain an abortion.) As Kavanaugh asserted that the majority\u2019s decision represented \u201ca radical extension of the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence,\u201d he added, \u201cIt is undoubtedly the case that many Americans \u2013 including many Justices and judges \u2013 disagree with one or another aspect of the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion jurisprudence.\u201d \u201cFrom one perspective,\u201d he wrote, assessing the abortion debate, \u201csome disagree with cases that allow the Government to refuse to fund abortions and that allow the Government to impose regulations such as parental consent, informed consent, and waiting periods\u2026 From the other perspective, some disagree with cases holding that the U.S. Constitution provides a right to an abortion.\u201d In 2011, the dispute over the President Barack Obama-sponsored Affordable Care Act, came before Kavanaugh\u2019s court. Kavanaugh dissented as the DC Circuit upheld the ACA\u2019s crucial mandate for individuals to buy insurance by 2014, asserting that it was too early to hear the controversy over a tax-related matter. In doing so, Kavanaugh invoked Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and the lessons of the court in the early 20th century: \u201c(H)istory and precedent counsel caution before reaching out to decide difficult constitutional questions too quickly, especially when the underlying issues are of lasting significance. After all, what appears to be obviously correct now can look quite different just a few years down the road.\u201d Some conservative critics faulted Kavanaugh for not taking up the merits of the dispute and declaring the ACA unconstitutional. But such critics were even more outraged when Republican-appointee Chief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote at the Supreme Court, in 2012, to uphold the ACA requirement that all Americans buy health insurance. On the current Supreme Court scale, Kavanaugh might compare to Justice Samuel Alito, a 2006 appointee and unflinching conservative. It is unlikely that Kavanaugh would land at the outermost pole of the court, where Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, Trump\u2019s first appointee, have aligned. Trump picks Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court Kavanaugh also appears readier than Gorsuch to finesse relations in the distinct social milieu of the nation\u2019s highest court, where the nine are thrown together in closed quarters \u2013 for life. (Early on, Gorsuch resisted some of the institutional traditions that matter to Roberts, and had a few testy public exchanges with Ginsburg. But he appears to have settled in at the end of his first full term.) That would make Kavanaugh \u2013 in a social vein \u2013 more like Justice Elena Kagan, a 2010 appointee of Obama who had similar executive branch experience and took steps early in her court tenure to ensure smooth relations with Justice Antonin Scalia on the right as well as Ginsburg on the left. It just so happened that on Monday night when he accepted Trump\u2019s nomination, Kavanaugh went out of his way to salute one of the justices with whom he would work. In a part-time post at Harvard, he said, \u201cI teach that the Constitution\u2019s separation of powers protects individual liberty, and I remain grateful to the dean who hired me, Justice Elena Kagan.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court confirmation battle that President Donald Trump triggered with his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh on Monday night may shine a harsh spotlight on the Senate\u2019s historic bias in favor of small states. Kavanaugh could be confirmed by a narrow Senate Republican majority rooted in the nation\u2019s smaller states over the virtually unified objections of a Democratic Senate minority strongest in the largest states. Kavanaugh in turn could cement a Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority that would control America\u2019s legal framework for years \u2013 regardless of how much of the nation\u2019s future population and economic growth flows into the largest states. The Senate\u2019s bias toward small states isn\u2019t new: An extended standoff over the issue nearly derailed the convention that wrote the Constitution. Yet the small-state bias may now be more relevant than ever, because it aligns more precisely than at earlier points in American history with the tectonic forces separating the two parties, including urbanization, racial and religious diversity, and the transition to an information-based economy. As small and large states separate even further along those dimensions in the years ahead, the constitutional compromise that provided each state two senators \u2013 in a narrow vote held 231 years ago next week \u2013 could provoke growing tension. Justice delayed: The Supreme Court is often behind the country \u201cThe Senate diverges wildly from (the principle of) one person one vote,\u201d says Frances Lee, a professor of government and politics at the University of Maryland and co-author of the book \u201cSizing Up the Senate: The Unequal Consequences of Equal Representation.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s been true since the start, from the very beginning. But it matters more when large and small states differ in a way that is highly relevant for party politics.\u201d In the Senate, the parties don\u2019t entirely sort across the large state, small state continuum. Republicans currently hold all the Senate seats across the large and growing Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Texas and Arizona \u2013 though Democrats are growing more competitive in each of them. Democrats in turn remain strong in smaller New England states including Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and Rhode Island. Most of the Rust Belt\u2019s big population centers are perennial battlegrounds between the parties, including Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Though Trump carried all four in 2016, Democratic senators in each of them are now considered solid favorites for re-election in November. But generally, the Republican Senate coalition is centered on smaller states, while Democrats rely relatively much more on the largest states. Republicans now hold 35 Senate seats and Democrats just 25 across the 30 smallest states. Democrats in turn hold 24, and Republicans just 16, Senate seats in the 20 largest states. Put another way, about half of the Democratic senators represent the 20 largest states, while over two-thirds of the Republicans represent the 30 smallest states. The contrast between the two Senate coalitions emerges even more clearly when looking at the total population of the states each side represents. One way of measuring the difference is to assign half of each state\u2019s population to each senator. Measured that way, the 51 Republican senators now represent about 143 million people, according to the latest Census Bureau state population estimates. The 49 Democratic senators represent about 182 million people, nearly 40 million more.  That\u2019s about 2.8 million people per Republican senator and 3.7 million people per Democratic senator. Some analysts might argue that comparison overstates the difference, because California alone accounts for almost 40 million people in the Democratic ledger. But Texas puts 28 million people in the Republican column. Eliminating the largest state on each side still leaves the Democratic senators representing nearly 30 million more people than their Republican counterparts. If every Republican votes for Kavanaugh, every Democrat votes no and Arizona\u2019s ailing GOP Sen. John McCain doesn\u2019t vote, as is likely, the senators opposing the choice would represent over 42 million more people than those supporting it. The sheer disparity in size between the largest and smallest states is the most visible source of questions about the Senate\u2019s democratic legitimacy. That divergence is sometimes summarized as the ratio between California and Wyoming, the largest and smallest states: Each California senator represents nearly 19.8 million people, over 68 times as many as the 290,000 each Wyoming senator represents. Republicans and Harley-Davidson have a similar problem. They're dealing with it in opposite ways. Yet even that contrast, while gaping, probably doesn\u2019t capture the central force that could significantly heighten tension over the Senate\u2019s structure in the years ahead. The real rub could be the widening divergence between the large and small states, not only in their partisan leanings, but also in their exposure to the most powerful forces reshaping American life in the 21st century. Critically, the small states tend to be less touched than the large ones by the nation\u2019s growing racial and religious diversity. Many of the smaller states remain more white and native-born than the nation overall. Wyoming, the smallest state, for instance, ranks 46th in the share of immigrants in its population and 43rd in the share of its under-18 population that is nonwhite. North Dakota and South Dakota, also in the five smallest states, rank 46th and 43rd respectively in immigrant population, and 42nd and 38th in the nonwhite share of their youth population. Montana and Maine, among the 10 smallest states, rank in the bottom 10 on both categories as well. Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, West Virginia, New Hampshire, Vermont and Idaho are among the other small states that rank relatively low in both categories too. David Shor, a senior analyst at Civis Analytics, a Democratic-oriented data consulting firm, has quantified how the Senate has increasingly diluted the electoral impact of minority voters over time. Using a statistical technique that compares the minority share of the population in each state to the minority share of the nation\u2019s overall population, he found that minority voters are more underrepresented in the Senate today than at any point since 1870. Projections by Robert Griffin of the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute show that minority underrepresentation is on track to widen further for at least the next 40 years as the nation grows more diverse. The reason for this growing gap, Shor explains, is that the minority population, particularly immigrants and their children, are concentrating in the largest states already disadvantaged by the Senate\u2019s structure, while the predominantly white and smaller states that gain under the rules are diversifying much more slowly. \u201cThe issue at a high level is that most growth in the nonwhite population has been concentrated in large states like California, New York and Florida,\u201d Shor says. That means the racial implications of the Senate\u2019s small state bias will only grow as the US continues its transition into a majority nonwhite nation through the next quarter century or so. Because that growing nonwhite population is concentrated in relatively fewer states, their influence in the Senate will be enduringly constrained. \u201cThe Senate is the last redoubt of white voting power,\u201d Shor says. \u201cYou have a small group of white rural states \u2026 that are going to have an enormous amount of power, not just over judges, but over vetoing legislation.\u201d GOP increasingly opposes legal -- not just illegal -- immigration Beyond race, other factors are separating the large and small states. The small states tend to be more rural (albeit with some notable exceptions, such as heavily urbanized Rhode Island, Nevada and Delaware), according to census figures analyzed by The Daily Yonder, a website that focuses on rural issues. Smaller states, with very few exceptions, tend to rank lower in the share of their jobs that require a high level of digital skill, a key measure of engagement with the information economy, according to analysis by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program. And even as white Christians have fallen to just over two-fifths of the nation\u2019s population, they remain a considerably larger share in many of the smaller states, such as West Virginia, South and North Dakota, Maine, Nebraska, Kansas, Arkansas and Idaho, according to surveys by the PRRI. All these dynamics now intertwine to produce a Senate that is structurally tilted to advantage the portions of America least touched by \u2013 and in many ways most hostile to \u2013 the big social and economic changes remaking American society. Because of the Senate\u2019s role in determining Electoral College votes and confirming justices, its bias toward those states reverberates through those dimensions of political power as well. \u201cThe fact that the racial divide is so deep between the parties, and the urban-rural divide is so deep between the parties, overlaps in problematic ways with the bias in Senate representation,\u201d says Lee. \u201cAnd that bias in Senate representation is also reflected in the Electoral College and in the composition of the court because it is the Senate\u2019s job to confirm nominations. So it\u2019s all linked.\u201d James Madison, the Constitution\u2019s principal architect, bitterly opposed equal representation for every state in the Senate; the dispute over population-based versus equal Senate representation proved the most difficult for the framers to resolve. (As Lee notes, equal representation in the Senate was decided only on a 5-4 vote of the states, with Massachusetts\u2019 delegation divided, on July 16, 1787.) Madison viewed equal Senate representation as unfair to voters in the largest states, but even he did not imagine that small and large states would consistently diverge in so many ways \u2013 not only in their political preference but also in their social and economic structure. As Lee and her co-author, Bruce Oppenheimer, recount in \u201cSizing Up the Senate,\u201d Madison tried to assuage small state fears by noting that the era\u2019s largest states \u2013 Massachusetts, Virginia and Pennsylvania \u2013 were wildly different in their religions, manners and agricultural economies. \u201cWas a Combination to be apprehended from the mere circumstance of equality of size?\u201d Madison insisted. \u201cExperience suggested no such danger.\u201d The connection that may decide 2018 isn't what you think Even today, \u201cequality of size\u201d doesn\u2019t ensure that states lean the same way politically. But that sorting by size seems likely to accelerate as Democratic-leaning minority groups and whites working in the information economy concentrate in the largest states, and Republicans grow more dominant among blue-collar, older, rural and religious whites who predominate in smaller states. Over time, that could enlarge the number of voices, like Shor, openly questioning whether the elements of the American political structure that advantage small states \u2013 the Electoral College and the two-senators-per-state rule \u2013 are systematically benefiting the groups and regions that embody America\u2019s past over those forging its future. \u201cWe have an electoral system that is structurally biased against this coalition at every level of government,\u201d he frets. Those complaints, for now, remain at the edge of political debate. But given the intense polarization of modern American politics, it\u2019s not difficult to imagine that changing sooner rather than later. For instance, if Trump lost the popular vote again in 2020 yet squeezed out a second Electoral College win, that institution would surely face more intense scrutiny. More immediately, a confirmation battle in which a Republican Senate coalition rooted in smaller, mostly white states enshrines a lasting Supreme Court majority over the objections of a Democratic coalition centered in larger, more diverse states could also provoke more questions about the Senate\u2019s imbalances. \u201cThe pressures are latent but it\u2019s not yet manifest in our politics,\u201d Lee says. \u201cThe thing to watch for is the extent to which politicians begin to question the fairness of the system. You need to see more of that before the system\u2019s legitimacy is in peril.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The news, when it came, couldn\u2019t have seemed more humdrum. Entitled \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump Announces Senior Staff Appointment,\u201d the press release from the White House read simply: \u201cPresident Donald J. Trump announced today that Bill Shine will join the White House staff. Mr. Shine will serve as Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications. He brings over two decades of television programming, communications, and management experience to the role. Previously, Mr. Shine served as Co-President of Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network.\u201d Wait, what? Look. It is the week of the Fourth of July. People are out of town. Lots of them. And, yes, we have known for a while that Shine was going to join the Trump White House. But none of that changes the fact that this is a very big story \u2013 and not for the reason you probably think. Yes, Shine is a close confidante of Sean Hannity, the Fox News Channel host and the most powerful informal adviser to Trump. And yes, Shine was a longtime protege of the late Fox News head Roger Ailes. But the fact that Trump views his presidency \u2013 and the world \u2013 through the decidedly distorted lens of Fox News isn\u2019t new. Having Shine in the White House means that Trump will likely go deeper down that rabbit hole \u2013 if that\u2019s even possible. The real story here \u2013 and why this should be a very big deal \u2013 is the fact that Shine resigned last year after being accused of covering up a series of sexual harassment scandals involving on-air talent at the network over the last several decades. When Shine was elevated to the co-president in the wake of Ailes\u2019 2016 resignation in the wake of accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior with co-workers, there was grumbling within the network. Wrote Vanity Fair\u2019s Gabriel Sherman in 2017: \u201cShine\u2019s continued leadership has angered many Fox News employees, especially women, who view him as a product of the misogynistic Ailes culture. Shine joined the network in 1996, served as Sean Hannity\u2019s producer, and rose through the ranks to become Ailes\u2019s deputy. In that role, sources say he had the power to stop multiple instances of sexual harassment, including that of former Fox booker Laurie Luhn, but did not do so. (Through a Fox News spokesperson, Shine denies this.) He\u2019s currently a defendant in a federal lawsuit filed this week by former Fox host Andrea Tantaros.\u201d Days after Sherman wrote those words, Shine was out \u2013 resigning on May 2, 2017. White House announces hiring of former Fox News exec Bill Shine Shine was named in at least four lawsuits or allegations related to alleged sexual harassment or racial discrimination at the network. He has denied all wrongdoing. Tantaros\u2019 lawsuit was later dismissed. But the idea \u2013 at the time \u2013 was that while Shine had never himself been accused of any sort of wrongdoing, he had been a leading part of a culture that was toxic to women. The swamp at Fox had to be drained, and Shine was part of that process. Lisa Bloom, an attorney involved in several of the lawsuits, tweeted: \u201cHaving rep\u2019d several Fox News accusers, let me tell you: it\u2019s worse than that. Mr. Shine has been accused over and over again of covering up for accused harassers Roger Ailes, Bill O\u2019Reilly and others, while the women were driven out of the industry entirely. #FillTheSwamp\u201d And now Shine works in the White House! As a deputy chief of staff and the de facto communications director! That, in and of itself, should be a big deal. Shine has never made clear what role \u2013 if any \u2013 he played in the cover-up of the inappropriate actions of Ailes and Fox News one-time star Bill O\u2019Reilly, who was also fired after it was revealed he had settled a number of sexual harassment lawsuits. Once O\u2019Reilly was fired, interest in him flagged \u2013 making it possible for Shine to not really answer questions about his behavior. But now Shine works for the American taxpayer. And he is one of the top advisers to the most powerful person in the country. Which changes things. Considerably. Tweeted Gretchen Carlson, who began all of this when she filed suit against Ailes in 2016, on the news of Shine\u2019s hire: \u201cThis \u2026. on the 2 year anniversary eve of filing my harassment lawsuit; giving women a voice, letting them know you can be believed, launching a national movement to stand up and speak up and say enough is enough. Life \u2026 works in mysterious ways. #BeFierce\u201d Then there is the fact that Trump\u2019s willingness to ignore questions surrounding Shine \u2013 what he knew, when he knew it and what (if anything) he did about it \u2013 appears to be a feature, not a glitch of this White House. Remember that chief of staff John Kelly was initially supportive of White House social secretary Rob Porter amid allegations that he has abused both of his ex-wives. Kelly was one of a handful of senior White House aides who knew of the allegations of domestic abuse against Porter for months before the story went public and Porter resigned in February. Days after Porter resigned, Trump was still defending his one-time aide publicly; \u201cHe says he\u2019s innocent and I think you have to remember that. He said very strongly yesterday that he\u2019s innocent, but you\u2019ll have to talk to him about that,\u201d Trump said. And don\u2019t forget that more than a dozen women have alleged that Trump himself behaved inappropriately toward them over the last several decades. During the 2016 campaign, Trump denied all of the allegations and insisted they were attacks driven by his political opponents. He also promised that after the election he would sue each and every one of his accusers for making false allegations. Trump has filed no lawsuits against any of his accusers to date. Trump allies are already seeking to cast any resistance to Shine\u2019s hiring as nothing more than the latest fight in the liberal battle against the President and Fox News. \u201cOn your marks, get set\u2026. how long till the liberal media and snowflakes start taking shots at the great Bill Shine,\u201d tweeted Donald Trump Jr. Thursday afternoon. \u201cCompetent, hard working and a  believer in making America great again!\u201d That spin misses the point, which is this: Shine resigned under pressure from Fox News amid questions about his role in creating or abetting a culture of intimidation and sexually inappropriate conduct. He now works at the White House. For the most powerful person in the country. And still hasn\u2019t explained much of anything about the circumstances that led to his dismissal from Fox News.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court continues to deliver an implicit message to civil rights advocates challenging state election practices as discriminatory: States can do what they want. 9-0 ruling masks deep division on gerrymandering at Supreme Court The conservative bloc under Chief Justice John Roberts has made plain that it believes states should be freer to determine their own voting maps and election practices, and that concerns about race discrimination simply do not carry the weight of earlier eras. By a 5-4 vote on Monday, the court upheld Texas congressional and legislative districts that a lower court declared discriminated against Latinos. Earlier this month, the same 5-4 lineup of Republican-appointed justices against Democratic-appointed justices affirmed an Ohio law for purging citizens from voter rolls that challengers said would disproportionately hurt minorities. The Texas and Ohio cases, combined with the court\u2019s recent actions declining to rule on claims of partisan gerrymandering, and a landmark ruling on the Voting Rights Act five years ago, suggest a freer rein for states. These decisions are likely to reverberate in upcoming elections and the post-2020 Census redistricting. As was seen in the Texas and Ohio cases, voting rights challenges typically comes from liberal, Democratic-leaning groups against Republican-controlled state legislatures. The Supreme Court trend might only strengthen the GOP hold on states and Congress. The court\u2019s ruling on the Texas and Ohio cases elicited scathing dissents from Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the only Latina justice, about the costs to democracy. Ruth Bader Ginsburg takes off the gloves \u201cOur democracy rests on the ability of all individuals, regardless of race, income, or status, to exercise their right to vote,\u201d she wrote, first in her June 11 dissent and then on Monday. In the Texas case, she said, the majority was wrongly intervening in the lower-court action and blinding itself to the factual record. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito, who also penned the decision in the Ohio case, said Texas deserved a \u201cpresumption of legislative good faith.\u201d \u201cThe dissent is simply wrong in claiming over and over that we have not thoroughly examined the record,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cthe dissent seems to think that the repetition of these charges somehow makes them true. It does not.\u201d Monday\u2019s action comes on the exact five-year anniversary of Shelby County v. Holder, when the justices \u2013 again on 5-4, liberal-conservative lines \u2013 rolled back a provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial bias to clear any redistricting or other electoral change with the Justice Department or a federal court. The Texas case, which dated to the 2010 Census and new legislative maps, centered on districts that a lower court said denied Latinos an equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. As Alito read portions of his decision from the court\u2019s tall mahogany bench on Monday, he emphasized the many federal requirements and protracted litigation Texas had faced through the years. He said the record failed to prove that its state legislature, redrawing districts in 2013, had acted in bad faith or intentionally discriminated. The high court majority undertook a fresh review of the evidence \u2013 a review the dissenters said wrongly intervened in the lower court proceedings. Homing in on one district, Sotomayor noted that the lower court had found that \u201cpolitical processes are not equally open to Hispanics\u201d in Texas because of its \u201chistory of official discrimination.\u201d At the core of Roberts-led court voting rights conflicts is the question of state-versus-federal authority. The majority has repeatedly sided with states and suggested, as Roberts wrote in Shelby County v. Holder that \u201cthings have changed dramatically\u201d since Congress passed the milestone 1965 act to ensure blacks and Hispanics could exercise their constitutional right to vote. On Monday, the liberal justices plucked a different line from Roberts\u2019 Shelby County opinion: \u201cvoting discrimination still exists; no one doubts that.\u201d \u201cThe court today does great damage to that right of equal opportunity,\u201d Sotomayor concluded. \u201cNot because it denies the existence of that right, but because it refuses its enforcement.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court on Monday ruled on two highly anticipated gerrymandering cases in Texas and North Carolina, in orders that mean most of the controversial maps in both states will likely be used this fall\u2019s midterm elections. 9-0 ruling masks deep division on gerrymandering at Supreme Court The court upheld three of four district maps in Texas that critics argued intentionally discriminated against minority voters, but struck down one. In North Carolina, it wiped away a lower court opinion that had invalidated congressional maps there as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The decision on Monday marked yet another step by the Supreme Court on gerrymandering cases. Last week, the court punted on alleged gerrymandering in Wisconsin and Maryland, allowing the maps to stand for now. \u201cThe common thread in the court\u2019s gerrymandering decisions this term has been to generally make it harder for plaintiffs to bring these claims,\u201d said CNN legal analyst and University of Texas Law School professor Steve Vladeck, \u201cand to generally allow states more flexibility and deference in drawing congressional and state district lines.\u201d The Texas case divided the justices by 5-4, splitting them along conservative-liberal lines. The court appeared closely divided on the case in April and split 5-4 last fall when it opted to freeze a lower court opinion invalidating two congressional districts and state house districts in four counties. Texas had argued it had been treated unfairly when the lower court struck down maps the court had actually ordered into effect during an earlier stage of the litigation. Challengers, including voting rights groups, had said the state adopted the interim maps only to dodge further litigation. In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito said all but one of the disputed districts reviewed were lawful. \u201cThere is nothing to suggest that the Legislature proceeded in bad faith, \u201d Alito wrote. In a blistering dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by the liberals on the bench, said the court went \u201cout of its way to permit the State of Texas to use maps that the three-judge District Court unanimously found were adopted for the purpose of preserving the racial discrimination that tainted its previous maps.\u201d In an unsigned order Monday, the court wiped away a lower court opinion that had invalidated congressional maps in North Carolina as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander and instructed the lower court to revisit the case in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion concerning maps in Wisconsin. In that case, Gill v. Whitford, a 9-0 court held that challengers did not have the legal right to bring the suit because they had failed to prove \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d injury that would demonstrate that the right to vote had been burdened. Now the lower court will have to see how the Wisconsin ruling should impact North Carolina. Even before ruling, the Supreme Court had suggested it was skeptical of the North Carolina ruling. The court voted 7-2 in January to put it on hold until it could act. That meant the maps would likely be used for the next election. Challengers to the North Carolina had hoped the court would take up their case and hear it next term. \u201cJustice delayed is justice denied,\u201d said Common Cause executive director Bob Phillips, \u201chowever, we are confident that we have standing to be able to make our way back to the Supreme Court so that the Justices may draw a clear line against partisan political gerrymanders that leave too many Americans without fair representation.\u201d North Carolina officials did not dispute that they sought to favor supporters of Republican candidates. The state legislator responsible for drawing the maps said he did so because \u201celecting Republicans is better than electing Democrats.\u201d",

After dropping out of the Republican presidential race in 2016, Huckabee said that he was \u201call in\u201d for Trump. Huckabee\u2019s tweet referencing Pelosi was retweeted on Saturday by the President\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. Huckabee did not respond to a CNN request for comment.

            "article_content": "At first glance, a Southern Baptist meeting might seem like a friendly audience for Vice President Mike Pence. A conservative Christian and longtime culture warrior, Pence shares many of Southern Baptists\u2019 faith commitments and some of their political views. With more than 15 million members, Southern Baptists are the country\u2019s largest evangelical denomination, and more than 80% of white evangelicals voted for the Trump-Pence ticket. But as Pence prepares to address nearly 10,000 delegates \u2013 called messengers \u2013 at the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s annual meeting here on Wednesday, a small but significant slice is opposing his appearance. Younger Southern Baptists in particular \u2013 a rising force with the election on Tuesday of J.D. Greear, 45, as the new president of the denomination \u2013 are wary of appearing too close to the GOP and detracting from their main mission: winning souls for Jesus. \u201cBy associating publicly with any administration,\u201d Garrett Kell, lead pastor of Del Ray Baptist Church in Virginia, told his fellow delegates Tuesday morning on the convention floor, \u201cwe send a mixed message to our members that to be faithful to the Gospel is to also align with that administration.\u201d Kell and others said they are also concerned that Pence\u2019s speech could endanger Southern Baptist missionaries and aid workers serving in countries that oppose the Trump administration. It could also harm the denomination\u2019s fragile relationship with racial minorities, he said. Kell said he \u201chas nothing against Pence personally,\u201d but he suggested Tuesday that Southern Baptists essentially disinvite Pence and replace his planned speech with time for prayer. Kell\u2019s motion was soundly defeated, but that didn\u2019t stop other Southern Baptists from proposing several similar resolutions, none of which passed. It\u2019s not unusual for national politicians to address church meetings. Barack Obama spoke at national meetings for the United Church of Christ, his own denomination, and a gathering of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Southern Baptists have hosted several presidents at their annual gatherings, according to historian Thomas Kidd, including George H.W. Bush, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, who was himself a Southern Baptist before leaving the denomination for a more liberal one. A spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention said the White House made the first move on Pence\u2019s speech, reaching out to ask if he could address the annual meeting. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Victor Pollido, a Southern Baptist pastor from California, said he believes God has placed officials such as Pence in office. He added that he is not bothered by the vice president\u2019s planned speech. \u201cIt\u2019s OK with me,\u201d Pollido said. \u201cChristians need to participate in society, just like Jesus did.\u201d Mike Turner, pastor of Lexington Baptist Church in South Carolina and a delegate to the annual meeting, said he didn\u2019t have a problem, either, with Pence\u2019s speech: \u201cOur conviction is that we should respect the people who are in positions of government leadership.\u201d But Turner said he knows many younger Southern Baptists don\u2019t agree. \u201cClearly, there\u2019s a new generation coming up who are growing discontent with the Republican Party and are more sensitive to the racial ramifications of the decision.\u201d Indeed Alishah Nemieboka, a delegate to the meeting who lives in Randallstown, Maryland, said she is not pleased about Pence\u2019s appearance and is considering skipping his speech. \u201cWith the history of the Southern Baptist Convention, and with us trying to get over that history and unite, Pence coming is like one step forward, two steps back,\u201d she said. The Southern Baptist Convention was founded in 1845, splitting with its Northern counterparts over slavery. Nemieboka and other Southern Baptists said they have not heard Pence make harmful statements about race. But he is tainted, Nemieboka said, by his association with President Donald Trump, who has made racially charged statements about Mexicans and other minorities and said a white nationalist rally in Virginia included some \u201cvery fine people.\u201d Nate Akin, 37, director of the pastor-led network Baptist21 and the son of a Southern Baptist seminary president, said it\u2019s too simplistic to paint all older Southern Baptists as pro-GOP and younger Southern Baptists as wary of partisan politics. But there is some truth to the generalization, he said. \u201cThere is a perception that Southern Baptists are in the pocket of the Republican Party,\u201d he said. \u201cBut to be a good Christian doesn\u2019t mean you have to be a good Republican \u2013 or a good Democrat, for that matter.\u201d Akin looked around the crowded lobby of a hotel adjacent to the convention center where Southern Baptists are meeting. \u201cThere\u2019s people here who would disagree with me about that, but I think it\u2019s true.\u201d Akin said Pence\u2019s appearance is an unwelcome distraction from Southern Baptists\u2019 main mission of spreading the Gospel. It also potentially makes people of color feel less at home in the Southern Baptist Convention, he said. For most of their annual meeting this week in Dallas, Southern Baptists have talked about spiritual matters, particularly their keen focus on gaining new converts. This post has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump plans to teach the NFL\u2019s kneeling players a strongman\u2019s lesson, saying in effect, that all Americans should adopt their President\u2019s concept of patriotism. Reigniting his base-pleasing, culture war feud with African-American players in a move that is certain to widen national divides on a deeply sensitive issue, Trump is telling the Philadelphia Eagles: Don\u2019t come to the White House Tuesday. The President\u2019s abrupt gambit inflamed a debate about the protests that he has relished but that has dragged two rare unifying points of American life \u2013 the NFL and the National Anthem \u2013 into the treacherous politics of the Trump era. Trump cancels Philadelphia Eagles visit to the White House Trump, angry that some Eagles players planned to skip their Super Bowl victory lap, is planning an event instead featuring the National Anthem in a jab at players who last season took a knee to protest racism when it was played before their games. In a Tuesday morning tweet heralding the event, Trump warned the NFL about \u201cescaping to locker rooms,\u201d a reference to a new league policy that allows players to remain off the field during the playing of the National Anthem if they choose not to stand for it. Trump\u2019s move \u2013 and the language he used to announce it \u2013 will also renew concern among his critics about his sometimes dictatorial political instincts, especially since he is now insisting he has \u201cabsolute\u201d power to pardon himself from any transgressions in the Russia investigation. After all, dictating the meaning of patriotism is a classic device of autocratic rulers around the world, many of whom \u2013 including Russian\u2019s Vladimir Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping \u2013 Trump appears to admire. \u201cThe Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow,\u201d Trump said in a statement Monday evening. \u201cThey disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country,\u201d he said. The President has solid political reasons for reopening the feud with protesting NFL players. To start with, Tuesday\u2019s event is all but certain to cause days of controversy that could help his perpetual efforts to cement his political foundation by playing into cultural, societal and racial questions that motivate his core voters. While supporters of the take-a-knee protests believe the players are exercising their constitutional rights, the President has styled himself as a spokesman for other Americans, many on the right, who see the demonstrations as unpatriotic. He has argued \u2013 in comments that millions of Americans support \u2013 that the protests are a gross insult to fighting men and women who have lain down their lives in wars abroad \u2013 a campaign that has also drawn the military onto uncomfortable political ground. And Trump is always willing to widen that divide and to cross into sensitive racial territory to take on black players who followed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, who initiated the protest. \u201cThis is a way of putting black players in their place,\u201d said Marc Lamont Hill, a professor of media studies and urban education at Temple University and a CNN political commentator, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to stand the way I tell you to, then you are not allowed in my White House, not the people\u2019s White House but my White House,\u201d the BET host said, paraphrasing what he sees as the message Trump is implicitly sending. The timing of Trump\u2019s move is also suspicious \u2013 and potentially strategic. After all, it\u2019s no surprise that many of the Eagles players never intended to attend the White House celebration because of Trump \u2013 everyone\u2019s known about it almost since they hoisted the Vince Lombardi trophy in February. Former Eagles wide receiver Torrey Smith, who was on the Super Bowl-winning team, hit out at the President in a series of tweets. \u201cSo many lies,\u201d Smith tweeted. \u201cHere are some facts 1. Not many people were going to go 2. No one refused to go simply because Trump \u201cinsists\u201d folks stand for the anthem 3. The President continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti military,\u201d he tweeted. The President waited until a few hours before remaining team members were due to arrive to spring the cancellation, raising questions about his motivation. The announcement also came on yet another day of damaging headlines over the Russia investigation, which may have given Trump an incentive to try to change the subject. The White House struggled to explain why press secretary Sarah Sanders and one of the President\u2019s top lawyers had insisted the President had nothing to do with drafting a misleading statement about a meeting in Trump tower involving a Russian delegation before the 2016 election. In a just-revealed letter to special counsel Robert Mueller that was sent in January, Trump\u2019s legal team admitted that the President had dictated the statement aboard Air Force One, raising questions of whether he was trying to cover up details of the meeting. The President\u2019s intervention also represented a new headache for the NFL itself. Just last week, the league\u2019s owners unanimously approved a new policy that requires players to stand during the anthem but allows them to remain in the locker room if they prefer. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league wanted people to respect the anthem but also wanted to be \u201cvery sensitive\u201d to give players choices. It was the kind of politically intricate arrangement designed to defuse the kind of conflict that Trump barges through almost every day. The President\u2019s intervention to stop the Eagles landing at the White House now all but insures the issue will be a hot topic when NFL pre-season camps open in less than two months.",

            "article_content": "It should be morning again, in America. The unemployment rate matched its lowest level in half a century. North Korea is talking peace. The fear of imminent terrorist attacks that haunted the 2000s has ebbed. While many troops are still in harm\u2019s way, the US no longer has tens of thousands of soldiers waging vast land wars in the Middle East. \u201cWe have such a great country right now,\u201d President Donald Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday. \u201cWe have some of the best economic numbers we\u2019ve ever had as a nation and that goes a long way and we\u2019re building something very special.\u201d Yet the United States is a long way from the fabled sense of security encapsulated by Ronald Reagan\u2019s \u201cMorning in America\u201d re-election ad. America is not at ease with itself. And it\u2019s putting the rest of the world on edge. There have been more dangerous and polarized moments in American history \u2013 but it\u2019s tough to recall a time when political discourse was so mean, and so dispiriting. This week, the White House could not bring itself to condemn a racist attack by Roseanne Barr, one of Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters. Comedienne Samantha Bee did say sorry \u2013 but only after calling the President\u2019s daughter Ivanka a \u201cfeckless c***\u201d \u2013 in what was just the latest explosion of angry and divisive rhetoric that punctuates most days in the Trump era. With the economy roaring, things ought to feel more comfortable. But in a turbulent time, kids now talk openly about the possibility of being shot at school. A new study in the journal Science suggests deepening polarization made Thanksgiving dinners up to 50 minutes shorter in politically divided families last year. A special counsel is burrowing deep into a young presidency. Trump\u2019s own revolt against the boundaries of his power has the country perpetually on the cusp of a constitutional crisis. \u201cWe are seeing a culture begin to seriously erode for our children and our grandchildren. It is happening,\u201d Ohio Republican Gov. John Kasich said on CNN this week. The biggest question in politics is how much is Trump responsible for the distemper? Well, he didn\u2019t invent political divisions and bare-knuckle politics. Presidents \u2013 with the possible exception of George Washington \u2013 have cursed for eons, and politics has never been for the easily offended. After all, an opponent once called former Vice President John Nance Garner a \u201clabor baiting, poker playing, whiskey-drinking, evil old man.\u201d But the vitriol is constant these days. Insults and controversies erupt every hour. And there\u2019s no question that Trump, who called Mexican immigrants rapists, mocked a reporter with disabilities and branded protesting NFL players sons of bitches, has coarsened political discourse. Many critics believe he\u2019s abandoned the notion that presidents should offer a moral lead. And Trump\u2019s winner/loser life calculus explains why he\u2019s ignored Americans who didn\u2019t vote for him. His presidency functions in a riptide of chaos and acrimony \u2013 in fact, its bewildering pace and emotive whirl may be what it needs to survive. Its existential purpose is tearing at societal, racial and cultural fault lines to ensure its foundation is replenished by outrage and anger from Trump\u2019s ever loyal base. His relentless churn leaves no time for reflection, or connecting the dots of a noxious political environment. And anger begets anger. Trump\u2019s opponents start to adopt his own unchained rhetoric \u2013 often on Twitter \u2013 and barriers of decorum and decency are overwhelmed. Yet for Trump\u2019s supporters, the disruption and shattered norms and outrage among establishment power centers in politics and the media in Washington is proof that he is doing exactly what they hoped he would do. For them, the old system and ways of behavior were so corrupt, dysfunctional and distant, that just tearing them down is enough. In many ways, Trump inherited a political environment ripe for exploitation after two decades of turmoil. Social media, the balkanization of the news industry into ideological fragments and gerrymandered congressional districts are often blamed for the bitter political tone. A financial crisis a decade ago left deep economic dislocation and though jobless numbers and housing markets have recovered, many Americans are still worse off and hurting. Mechanization is ravaging traditional industry. And an opioid crisis is scarring the heartland. Twice in the last 20 years, on Sept. 11, 2001, and with Russia\u2019s meddling in the last presidential election, America\u2019s enemies have exploited its freedoms to attack it, igniting furious debates about US institutions and values that scorched national unity. All of this is the backdrop to Trump\u2019s surge to power in 2016, when he turned bitterness at a political system that had no answers for many Americans into a populist crusade. At the time, many Trump supporters saw his vulgarity as proof he was an authentic scourge of the establishment. But in office, he\u2019s worsened national dislocation by making lying and the peddling of conspiracy theories a central political strategy. His presidency is rooted in an assault on the institutions \u2013 like the Justice Department and the FBI \u2013 that underpin American public life. And he\u2019s turned on America\u2019s friends abroad, launching trade wars with Europe and Canada. This week, Trump \u2013 in his escalating effort to discredit the special counsel probe \u2013 accused Robert Mueller of plotting to meddle in the midterm elections. It was a move that threatened to cast doubt on the integrity of the polls, and for his supporters, the result, should Democrats win. A source familiar with discussions inside Trump\u2019s legal team told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta this week that the President would sharpen the attacks heading into the fall elections. \u201cThat\u2019s bad for the country,\u201d the source said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s likely to get worse.\u201d Trump\u2019s constant barrages may actually also be depriving him of some of the credit he is entitled to claim for the healthy economy. At the end of 1988, when the unemployment rate hit the lowest point of his presidency, at 5.3%, Reagan\u2019s Gallup approval rating stood at 63%. Bill Clinton hit 66% at the end of 2000, when unemployment was at 3.9%. In the latest CNN/SSRS poll, Trump was at 41%, and it stands to reason that his disruptive, norm-busting behavior is largely to blame. Still, Gallup\u2019s famous poll of national mood has 37% of Americans satisfied with the direction of the country, the highest level since early August 2005. However, 62% are dissatisfied. Given the depth of current political divides, and the hankering of Democrats who want revenge for 2016, as well as Trump\u2019s determination to ignite the anger of his base, it seems unlikely the political fury will end soon. At the end of another tumultuous political year, 1968, which was characterized by assassinations and social unrest that makes 2018 look tame, the nation united in awe as the astronauts of Apollo 8 beamed back stunning photos of Earth, humanity\u2019s common home, after beating the Soviets to become the first men to orbit the Moon. With the space program in hiatus, it\u2019s tough to imagine another event that could ease today\u2019s political tempest and unite Americans in the same way. The moment when then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois vowed there \u201cis not a liberal America and a conservative America \u2013 there is the United States of America\u201d seems far more than 14 years ago. In his new book \u201cThe World as It Is,\u201d Obama confidant and speechwriter Ben Rhodes says his boss wondered after Trump\u2019s victory whether his vision of a politics freed of its tribal divides had been wrong \u2013 or premature. \u201cSometimes, I wonder whether I was 10 or 20 years too early,\u201d Rhodes quotes Obama as saying. Many conservatives differ with the idea that the 44th president was a conciliator or a unifying force. But someday, probably decades hence, perhaps some other politician of either party might risk a campaign based on the idea that Americans are more united than divided. Another leader soon to exit the stage, John McCain, is also pining for a time when political acrimony was less intense. \u201cBefore I leave, I\u2019d like to see our politics begin to return to the purposes and practices that distinguish our history from the history of other nations,\u201d the ailing senator from Arizona writes in his new book, \u201cThe Restless Wave.\u201d \u201cWe are citizens of a republic made of shared ideals forged in a new world to replace the tribal enmities that tormented the old one.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Two days after Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico, President Donald Trump was busy kicking up a storm of his own. Speaking in Alabama on Friday night, September 22, 2017, Trump took aim at the small group of NFL players who were kneeling, during the national anthem, as a protest against racial injustice. Team owners, he said, should be meeting their demonstrations with calls to \u201cget that son of a bitch off the field right now,\u201d adding theatrically: \u201cHe\u2019s fired!\u201d As the President blustered and baited, Puerto Rico suffered. According to the official count, 64 people died during and after the ravenous storm. That estimate was always assumed to be on the low end, but a new, independent study published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine has brought to bear something closer to the true depths of the tragedy. In their report, researchers from Harvard and other institutions placed the toll much higher, at more than 4,600 lives. One-third of the fatalities, the study found, \u201cwere reported by household members as being caused by delayed or prevented access to medical care.\u201d Trump's Puerto Rico response is confirming his critics' worst fears The magnitude of loss on the island \u2013 and the continued suffering of both the people still there and those forced to flee \u2013 will be a stain on the Trump administration that outlasts its time in Washington, a searing reminder of what\u2019s at risk when a society and its leaders reveal themselves to be unequipped, in every sense, to contend with a real disaster. The new report is the latest in a series of more thorough, independent investigations into the storm\u2019s devastation. Last year, a CNN survey of Puerto Rican funeral homes, counting deaths from September 20 through October 19, put the number of those believed to be storm-related at 499. San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on November 3, offered a similar estimate. By then, the initial shock and panicked relief efforts had passed. Reporters like CNN\u2019s Leyla Santiago kept close, but the news cycle never stopped spinning. This is Natalio. He died in Puerto Rico when the machine he used to breath stopped working- lack of power. His daughter told me, \"It's a shame that it took an institution like Harvard to shine a light on what we've been saying all along.\" Natalio's Story: https://t.co/CB6fYObnqI pic.twitter.com/y60IEtogOL During the first two weeks after hurricane struck, Trump\u2019s Twitter feed featured a maddening mix of exhortations to vote in the Alabama special election primary, best wishes to the people caught in Maria\u2019s path, jabs at Republicans who opposed another failed Obamacare repeal push, tributes to FEMA and first responders, and repeated potshots at pro football players. Over time, as situation in Puerto Rico deteriorated and the administration faced criticism for its response, Trump turned bitter. On September 25, he turned his ire on the island itself. \u201cTexas & Florida are doing great but Puerto Rico, which was already suffering from broken infrastructure & massive debt, is in deep trouble,\u201d he said in the first of a series of three tweets. \u201cIt\u2019s old electrical grid, which was in terrible shape, was devastated. Much of the Island was destroyed, with billions of dollars \u2026 owed to Wall Street and the banks which, sadly, must be dealt with. Food, water and medical are top priorities - and doing well.\u201d A day later, with Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy looking on, Trump talked up the administration\u2019s \u201cmassive\u201d efforts in the region, praised Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 for praising him, and explained \u2014 as if it were some newly discovered wonder \u2014 that rescue and recovery work in Puerto Rico was more complicated than in places like Texas because \u201cit\u2019s on an island in the middle of the ocean. It\u2019s out in the ocean. You can\u2019t just drive your trucks there from other states.\u201d Excuses in place, Trump by September 30 had settled on a villain. He leveled a series of attacks against Cruz, the San Juan mayor, in response to her criticism of the White House\u2019s relief work, as many on the island waited on help without power or access to clean water and medical aid. \u201cThe Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,\u201d Trump tweeted early that morning. \u201cThey,\u201d he added, naming the mayor and \u201cothers in Puerto Rico,\u201d \u201cwant everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort.\u201d In an interview later that day with Orlando television station WKMG, Vice President Mike Pence echoed Trump\u2019s complaints, calling it \u201cfrustrating\u201d for \u201cmillions of Americans to hear rhetoric coming out from some in Puerto Rico, particularly the mayor of San Juan, instead of focusing on results.\u201d A few days later, Trump visited Puerto Rico, where he made a show of tossing paper towel rolls, like he was playing pop-a-shot basketball, to a crowd and compared the number of dead favorably \u2013 \u201cSixteen people versus in the thousands\u201d \u2013 to what followed \u201ca real catastrophe\u201d like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \u201cThat was a terrific visit,\u201d he told reporters on the flight home, \u201cthat visit was terrific.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Stacey Abrams made history Tuesday night by being the nation\u2019s first black woman nominated for governor by a major political party. She also upended Georgia\u2019s conventional wisdom about minority candidates. If there was a conception that African-Americans will have trouble winning primaries in areas without many minorities, Abrams shattered it; she won everywhere and by huge margins. In fact, out of Georgia\u2019s 159 counties, she won all but 6 of them, besting rival Stacey Evans in many white enclaves across the state. Particularly notable is Abrams\u2019 resounding victory in Atlanta-area Forsyth County, which was considered hostile to African Americans for nearly a century. Before some recent changes, it was referred to for years by area residents, and virtually was, a whites-only county. As recently as 1990, 14 black residents lived in Forsyth County. But on Tuesday, Abrams carried 63 percent of the vote, out of about 6,300 Democratic votes cast (the county was among the top 20 of 159 for Democratic primary turnout in Georgia.) The sin of Forsyth County\u2019s purge dates back nearly 100 years to 1912. That year, the county\u2019s black population, about 1,000 people at the time, were driven out altogether after what was essentially a white riot. A young white woman had been murdered. One of the black men accused of the crime was beaten and lynched. Widespread attacks and burning of African American homes across the county followed. The horrible episode was documented by Patrick Phillips, who grew up there and called it a \u201cracial cleansing\u201d in his book Blood at the Root. \u201cYou know, this is \u2013 was not unique to Forsyth that there was an attempt at racial cleansing. What\u2019s really unique to Forsyth is that it\u2019s a place where it succeeded and that effort was successful for, you know, almost 100 years. It was still a, quote, unquote, \u201cwhite county\u201d when I was growing up there in the \u201970s and \u201880s. And it really in some ways - I mean, in the book, there\u2019s a flashpoint in 1912,\u201d Phillips told NPR in 2016. In the late 1990s and into the new century, the picture slowly began to change, but black residents remained a slim minority. The last complete Census in 2010 shows that only 4,510 African Americans lived in the county, out of more than 175,000 people. Forsyth has tried to shed its racist past in recent years, and to some extent has succeeded in making minority populations more welcome. In 2016, a black Democratic candidate even ran for state senate and garnered 22% of the vote against the heavily favored Republican on Election day. It is unlikely that Abrams will do much better when voters choose their next governor in November. President Donald J. Trump won the county by a huge margin that year, with 75% of the vote to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 25%. There were about 6,300 people who voted in the Democratic primary Tuesday night. Closer to 19,000 voted in the Republican primary. Clearly, it remains a Republican stronghold. But Abrams\u2019 resounding victory in Forsyth \u2013 even though just among Democrats \u2013 could be a harbinger of a more broader appeal. November, of course, will tell us just how much.",

            "article_content": "While Democrats came up short in last Tuesday\u2019s Arizona special election \u2013 losing by fewer than five points in a district Donald Trump carried by 21 points \u2013 the results offer yet another sign the party still holds the energy edge heading into November\u2019s midterm election. As we approach a cluttered stretch of the primary calendar, the results from those contests \u2013 and the next wave of campaign fundraising reports in June \u2013 will help to clarify the Democratic Party\u2019s prospects this fall. That deadline will offer a good idea of whether Democrats can maintain momentum. More than three dozen Democratic House candidates outraised Republican incumbents for the second quarter in a row after the most recent filing. What you need to know right now about the 2018 midterm elections Trump\u2019s national approval rating, meanwhile, continues to hover around 40%, which poses an additional challenge for GOP candidates running this year. With all that in mind, we are moving a dozen Republican held House districts to a more competitive rating. Each race below is moving in the direction of the Democrats even though the Republican remains favored in all of them. As a reminder, Democrats need a net gain of 23 seats in order to win control of the House. Of the 11 races rated Lean Democratic by CNN, seven are currently held by Republicans, as are 19 of the 21 races rated Toss-Up. Of the 25 races CNN now rates as Lean Republican, all are Republican-held \u2013 or in the case of the Ohio 12th District seat vacated by Pat Tiberi, had been held by a Republican. AZ-06: You might not have to look very far for reverberations from last week\u2019s special election results. The neighboring 6th District, represented by GOP Rep. Dave Schweikert, is more favorable terrain for Democrats than the 8th District \u2013 more suburban and home to a higher percentage of college graduates. Trump won here by 10 points, a much slimmer margin than Mitt Romney\u2019s 21-point spread in 2012. Arizona has a late primary at the end of August, but Democrats believe Arizona State University nursing professor Heather Ross has the potential to make this race more competitive if she emerges as the nominee. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. AR-02: Arkansas state Rep. Clarke Tucker gives Democrats a candidate who could make inroads in the 2nd District, home to Little Rock. Tucker announced his bid in early February, and despite the late start managed to beat GOP Rep. French Hill in fundraising by about $130,000 in the first quarter. Trump won the district by 10 points, slipping from Romney\u2019s 12-point margin four years earlier. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. CA-04: There are some shared qualities with the northern Sacramento suburbs of California\u2019s 4th District and the Phoenix suburbs from Arizona\u2019s 8th District. Both have a large contingent of senior citizens. They also have a similar racial breakdown. Trump won only 53% in this district, falling off five points from Romney\u2019s 58% mark in 2012. Veteran GOP Rep. Tom McClintock has been outraised by leading Democratic candidate Jessica Morse in three consecutive fundraising quarters. Morse also has a $715,000 to $676,000 cash on hand lead. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. FL-16: GOP Rep. Vern Buchanan has won comfortably the last two cycles, and while he remains a heavy favorite he\u2019ll have to work a bit to earn a seventh term in this Sarasota-area district. He\u2019s sitting on $2.5 million in the bank and raised $480,000 in the first quarter. He\u2019ll likely face Sarasota attorney David Shapiro in November. The Democrat raised $400,000 in the first quarter and is just shy of half a million cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. IL-14: Lauren Underwood, a registered nurse and former Department of Health and Human Services adviser in the Obama administration, scored 57% of the vote in a crowded Democratic primary last month. Democrats are hopeful she can give GOP Rep. Randy Hultgren a serious challenge in the 14th District, which is made up of Chicago exurbs. Hultgren has benefited from weakly-funded challengers in previous cycles \u2013 a luxury he likely won\u2019t have against Underwood, who raised $465,000 in the first quarter. Hultgren brought in $360,000 \u2013 but still has a significant cash on hand advantage ($783,000 vs. $235,000). While Trump won this district by four points in 2016, Barack Obama carried it with 50% in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. MI-01: This northern Michigan district, which includes the Upper Peninsula, went for Trump by 22 points, but gave Romney and McCain single-digit victories. The race is shaping up to be a contest between two Marine Corps veterans \u2013 incumbent GOP Rep. Jack Bergman and Democratic candidate Matthew Morgan. Morgan has outraised Bergman in each of the past two quarters and now holds a $317,000 to $307,000 advantage in terms of cash on hand. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. NJ-03: GOP Rep. Tom MacArthur\u2019s support for Trump\u2019s agenda (health care repeal and tax cuts) and a strong challenge from likely Democratic nominee Andy Kim make this swing district competitive. The district went for Trump by six points, but backed Barack Obama by four in 2012. Kim, a former national security adviser to Obama, outraised MacArthur by more than $200,000 in the first quarter, though the Republican still holds an advantage of roughly $270,000 in cash on hand. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. NM-02: Both parties are facing primary fights in the 2nd District, which opened up when GOP Rep. Steve Pearce decided to run for governor in the Land of Enchantment. On the Republican side, it appears to be a contest between state Rep. Yvette Herrell and former Hobbs Mayor Monty Newman. Xochitl Torres Small looks to the the frontrunner for the Democratic nod. The attorney and former field representative for Sen. Tom Udall raised $313,000 in the first quarter, beating Newman and Herrell combined. While registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in this district,  Trump carried it by 10 points, which was a wider margin than Romney\u2019s seven-point win in 2012. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. OH-01: All eyes in Ohio are on the 12th District special election in August, but the House race in the Buckeye State to watch in November is likely to be the 1st District, where GOP Rep. Steve Chabot could face a serious challenge from Democrat Aftab Pureval. Pureval, the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts, outraised Chabot by nearly half a million dollars in the first quarter of 2018. This district, which includes the western and northern parts of the Cincinnati metro area, went for Trump by seven points and Romney by six points. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. OH-07: Speaking of Ohio, GOP Rep. Bob Gibbs improved a bit on his lackluster $86,000 fundraising quarter at the end of 2017 \u2013 raising $113,000 in the first quarter of 2018. Democrat Ken Harbaugh, a former Navy pilot, hauled in $441,000 \u2013 after raising $272,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017. Gibbs still has $1.3 million in the bank compared to Harbaugh\u2019s $726,000. The Gibbs campaign and Ohio Republicans have been attacking Harbaugh\u2019s primary opponent, Patrick Pikus, who is little known and has only raised $5,000 for his campaign \u2013 perhaps in an attempt to raise his name ID. Democrats see the move as an indication the Gibbs campaign views Harbaugh as a threat. Race moves from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. WA-05: Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a member of the House GOP leadership, has a tough race on her hands against Democrat Lisa Brown, the former chancellor of Washington State University Spokane. A recent poll of the district showed McMorris Rodgers leading Brown by six points, 44% to 38%, with 16% undecided. McMorris Rodgers hauled in $776,000 in the first quarter compared to $649,000 for Brown \u2013 and the Republican leads in cash on hand by more than $700,000. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. WI-06: Even with House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s retirement, a lot of attention in the Badger State will be paid to the 1st District race. But the contest in the 6th District could be the best pickup opportunity in the state for Democrats, with Dan Kohl \u2013 nephew of former Sen. Herb Kohl \u2013 giving the party a serious challenger to GOP Rep. Glenn Grothman. Kohl has outraised Grothman now in three consecutive quarters and has $136,000 more in the bank to start April. This is another district where Trump outperformed previous Republican candidates, winning by 17 points. Romney won it by seven in 2012 while Obama carried the district in 2008. Race moves from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct first quarter fundraising numbers for the candidates running in Illinois' 14th District.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court was sharply divided on Tuesday as the justices considered a lower court opinion that invalidated congressional and statehouse maps in Texas, holding that they discriminated against minority voters. Last fall, in an early indication that the case could break down along ideological lines, the justices split 5-4 and voted to freeze the lower court opinion while the court considered the case. It was that order, which likely means that the disputed maps will be used in the upcoming midterm elections, that infuriated the liberal justices on Tuesday who suggested that the Supreme Court had stepped in prematurely and therefore had no jurisdiction to hear the challenge. While the district court had issued a ruling invalidating the districts it had not yet taken the final step of telling the state how to redraw the maps. What ends the case, said Justice Sonia Sotomayor, is a \u201cfinal injunction.\u201d Other liberal justices, Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer, had a similar sentiment. Supreme Court limits suits against foreign corporations in the US The conservatives did not focus as much on the threshold question of the court\u2019s ability to decide the issue and Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that Texas legislature deserved \u201csome presumption of good faith.\u201d The case is the latest in a series of voting rights cases the Supreme Court is hearing this term including two partisan gerrymander cases and another challenge to Ohio\u2019s system for purging voters from its rolls. Josh Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky College of Law, says that if the justices rule in favor of the challengers in the case and find intentional discrimination in how the Republicans drew the lines, it could be a watershed ruling. \u201cIf the court rules against Texas, the justices would be saying that the Republican-controlled legislature had an improper racial motive,\u201d he said. Tuesday, the conservative justices focused on the unusual circumstances in the case and did not seem inclined to agree with the lower court, in the case that has been caught up in the courts for almost a decade. After the last census, voting rights groups such as the Southern Coalition for Social Justice and the Mexican American Legal Defense Education Fund challenged the maps drawn in 2011 by the Republican-led legislature. Supreme Court hears from all corners of the country ahead of travel ban case They won the challenge when a three-judge court of the District Court for the Western District of Texas held that the maps were intentionally discriminatory and proceeded to order new interim maps to be drawn up for the next election. The court stressed that its ruling was not a final judgment, but necessary due to impending election deadlines. The legislature subsequently adopted those maps \u2013 called Plan C235 \u2013 on a permanent basis while the litigation continued. After a trial in 2017, the district court then invalidated two districts of Plan C235. The court noted that \u201cspecific portions\u201d of the 2011 plans that were found to be discriminatory or unconstitutional \u201ccontinue unchanged.\u201d In a similar case the court also invalidated several state legislative districts. \u201cThe discriminatory taint was not removed by the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the court\u2019s interim plans, because the Legislature engaged in no deliberative process to remove any such taint, and in fact intended any such taint to be maintained but be safe from remedy,\u201d wrote US District Court Judge Xavier Rodriguez of the Western District of Texas. Rod Rosenstein gets his day at the Supreme Court Lawyers for Texas say the maps should stand, particularly because they were imposed by the court and adopted by the legislature. Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller told the justices that the legislature was not \u201ctrying to pull a fast one,\u201d and he suggested that the district court\u2019s opinion was wrong to say the legislature had engaged in intentional discrimination when it adopted \u2013 as its own \u2013 the same plans that the court had ordered the state to use in the 2012 election. \u201cThe Texas legislature did not have a racially discriminatory purpose when it adopted the entire court-ordered congressional remedial plan and virtually all of the remedial state house plan,\u201d Keller said. In court, the conservative justices suggested they agreed with Texas. Roberts said there was a \u201cstrong\u201d argument that the legislature adopted a court drawn plan, and asked if that didn\u2019t demonstrate \u201cgood faith\u201d on the part of the law makers. Justice Samuel Alito agreed that the district court drew the interim plans after a \u201cthorough analysis.\u201d Lawyers for the challengers emphasized that when the district court allowed the maps back in 2012, it was simply a preliminary ruling before an impending election. Allison Riggs of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice said that afterward the court \u201csussed out\u201d a troubling pattern aimed at discriminating against minorities. She said the only reason the state had adopted the plans was in order to end the litigation and muffle the voices of minorities. The ruling in the case is due by late June, but Douglas points out that in 2020, after the next census, states will have to once again redraw lines. \u201cDepending on the court\u2019s ruling, the Texas case could have a meaningful impact on how states all over the country draw their next maps,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "James Comey will be interviewed on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d on Thursday, April 19, at 4p ET. James Comey sits silently in a promo video for his first interview ahead of his new book, shifting with a stern expression as he faces questioning from an interviewer. It\u2019s the most we\u2019ve seen recently of the former FBI director, whose firing at the hands of President Donald Trump in May sparked a blaze in Washington that still smokes today. It\u2019s also just about all we\u2019ve heard from him after he receded into private life following a Senate testimony in June that poured fuel. On Thursday, that changed as excerpts from the book were published online and the first clips from that ABC interview aired. On Sunday, as Comey\u2019s full sit-down with George Stephanopolous rolls out, he\u2019ll set off on a book tour bonanza with stops at talk show tables, late night armchairs, and live on a stage at a CNN town hall. Comey, 57, is looking forward to telling his story, a person who has spoken to him recently said. His past few months have been quiet, spent with family, taking in theater and writing his book, \u201cA Higher Loyalty,\u201d and popping up occasionally on Twitter to respond to the latest drama at the White House. \u201cHe\u2019s ready to be able to counter a lot of the lies and to help set the record straight,\u201d this person said. Being outside of the public view is not something the 6\u20198\u201d Comey is used to. Before he inserted the bureau\u2019s tradecraft into the 2016 election and was called a \u201cshowboat\u201d by the President on primetime TV, Comey was known by FBI special agents as a proud spokesman and booster of the law enforcement agency. (He was also derided by some on the inside as \u201cSt. Jimmy,\u201d for his priestly self-confidence.) He visited all 56 field offices in his first year and would make sure his staff cleared his schedule for graduations at the FBI academy, where he would take pictures with the family members of each new recruit. He often gave speeches, educating audiences about the bureau\u2019s top priorities, like terrorism and cybersecurity. He cut his teeth, however, on smaller potatoes. As a line prosecutor in the Manhattan US attorney\u2019s office in the 1980s and \u201990s, Comey, a recent graduate of the University of Chicago Law School, appeared on dockets including USA v. Friedman, a liquor racketeering case, and USA v. Candelario, over transported stolen property. As he rose the ranks, joining the special counsel team that investigated President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, as a deputy in the Whitewater probe, and later serving as a top assistant US attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Comey honed a reputation as a strong-willed prosecutor. In 2002, months after the September 11 attacks, he returned to New York\u2019s Southern District, this time as its chief federal prosecutor. Harry Sandick, then a junior attorney in the narcotics unit, recalled a meeting of the full criminal division that Comey addressed early in his posting. \u201cHe said \u2018who here has never lost a trial?\u2019\u201d asking people to raise their hands, said Sandick, a partner now at a Manhattan criminal defense firm. \u201cHe said, \u2018those of you who are raising your hands, you\u2019re in the chickenshit club because you\u2019ve never taken a case to trial that you\u2019ve ran a risk of losing.\u2019 He said \u2018if you\u2019ve lost a trial, then I know that you\u2019ve approached this job the right way: to do justice, even when it\u2019s not easy, even when the easier course would have been to look the other way.\u2019\u201d After a successful tenure in New York, which included bringing charges of insider trading that would later be proven against Martha Stewart, Comey was called to Washington by President George W. Bush, where he served as the second in command at the Department of Justice. People who know Comey, and those who write about him, often tell the story from this time of Attorney General John Ashcroft, on his sickbed, in 2004. Comey was the acting attorney general, given his boss\u2019 incapacitation, and was refusing the Bush administration\u2019s request to reauthorize a domestic surveillance program that he thought was unlawful. Top White House aides raced to the hospital to persuade the ill Ashcroft to sign off. Comey, tipped off, arrived minutes before and thwarted the plan. The story is an indicator, they say, of his integrity. In 2013, Comey was sworn in as the 7th director of the FBI \u2013 a lifelong Republican, appointed by a hero of the left, President Barack Obama. His time atop the bureau was punctuated by law enforcement events that impacted the nation: a wave of homegrown terrorists inspired by ISIS messaging were drawing blood on American soil; so too were police officers who killed a number of unarmed black men, spurring mass protests and riots across the country. Comey\u2019s FBI helped arrest dozens of young men accused of plotting attacks and providing support to foreign terror groups. And in 2015 in a speech entitled \u201cHard Truths,\u201d he admitted that unconscious racial bias was a problem that had to be addressed in American policing. \u201cWhether it\u2019s Hillary Clinton, whether it\u2019s San Bernardino, whether it\u2019s race and law enforcement, he recognized the issues before him,\u201d said Josh Campbell, Comey\u2019s former special assistant at the FBI and now a CNN analyst. \u201cUnderstanding the symbolism of his role as FBI director rather than retreat as many in Washington do when faced with tough issues, he realized that a true leader has to work their in-box and they have to make tough decisions.\u201d When Comey in 2015 embraced the idea that an uptick in urban violent crime could be attributed to restraint by cops in the wake of \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d criticism \u2013 a tacit endorsement of the so-called \u201cFerguson effect\u201d \u2013 he drew criticism from civil rights activists and his own White House. But his decisions in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election and after made him the paragon of controversy, as the FBI investigated the conduct of the two main party nominees. In July of 2016, Comey made an announcement that the FBI would not recommend charges against Clinton, the Democratic contender, for using a private email server as secretary of state, despite her being \u201cextremely careless.\u201d It was an unusual critique and public acknowledgment, which Comey has said was necessary given the circumstances. The case flared up again briefly in the days before the November vote when new emails were found on the laptop of a Clinton aide. Powerful lawmakers said they had lost confidence in the FBI chief. After Trump\u2019s election victory, reports of an FBI investigation into his campaign and collusion with the Russian government dominated headlines. In May 2017, after receiving letters recommending he do so from the leaders of the Justice Department, Trump fired Comey, less than four years into his ten-year term. Comey learned of his fate from cable news while he was speaking to FBI personnel on a visit to the Los Angeles field office. He left the towering white building in a state of uncertainty to return to Washington. As he walked across the tarmac at LAX towards an idling plane, live video from hovering news helicopters showed Comey break ranks from his detail to shake the hands of the local law enforcement officers who had helped protect him, a ritual he had practiced on every trip. Howard University senior Jordan Jean has interacted with Comey a half dozen times since one of the nation\u2019s top law enforcement officers was fired. Comey in August was named the Colbert I. King Endowed Chair in Public Policy by the historically black college, and Jean has spoken alongside him on panels and met with him in private as the president of a political discussion student group, Howard United. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t switch up. He\u2019s Jim Comey behind the scenes and on camera. He believes in what he believes in and he sticks to that. But he also allows there to be room for change,\u201d Jean said. In September, Comey was shouted down by protestors upset with his stance on the Ferguson Effect, among other things, as he spoke at Howard\u2019s convocation ceremony. For fifteen minutes, he stood in near-silence as students yelled \u201cI love being black\u201d and \u201cGet out James Comey \u2013 you\u2019re not our homey.\u201d Eventually, he finished the speech. Since then, Comey has spoken at political science classes and a series of lectures at the university, including one, on Wednesday, about race and policing. After the end of an event, he often will stay behind to answer questions from students, Jean said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get the feeling that he was the former FBI director. He doesn\u2019t come in the room like \u2018the man.\u2019 He honestly comes in the room like a big tall giant, a gentle giant,\u201d Jean said.",

            "article_content": "The progressive Working Families Party is facing what might be its weightiest decision since emerging on the New York political scene two decades ago. As early as this weekend, the party\u2019s New York state committee could vote to endorse Cynthia Nixon, the actress and activist challenging two-term Gov. Andrew Cuomo in September\u2019s Democratic primary. Launched in 1998, the WFP is growing in size and influence, with operations in 19 states and reach well beyond that.

Now, as the movement coalesced by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign looks to solidify its foothold in Democratic Party politics, the WFP\u2019s ambitions are broadening. What began as a small coalition of unions, community organizers and activists is rallying support for candidates like Randy \u201cIron Stache\u201d Bryce, a Democrat running to replace House Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin, and Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams, who could become the state\u2019s first African-American governor. 20 years in community organizing, elections and social movements. Most recently, an organizer and strategist with @mvmt4bl. His next endeavor? The new National Director of the Working Families Party. Join us in welcoming Maurice Mitchell to the Working Families Party family! pic.twitter.com/PSUweMd3lQ Earlier this week, before Ryan announced his decision to retire at the end of the year, the WFP introduced Maurice Mitchell, a 38-year-old activist and leading organizer from within the Movement for Black Lives, as its next national director. He\u2019ll take the reins from longtime leader Dan Cantor this summer. CNN spoke to Mitchell, a New York native, this week about the fight for its gubernatorial endorsement and his vision for the party and national progressive movement. The interview that follows has been edited and condensed. Krieg: The New York WFP has a pretty big decision to make. Have you been in touch with the state committee about the Nixon-Cuomo primary? Are you encouraging them in any way? Mitchell: There\u2019s a lot of debate currently happening. I think what is shocking to a lot of folks is the fact that the state committee actually votes to make this decision. We pride ourselves on having real democratic processes. This isn\u2019t a top-down organization. So, both Gov. Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon have their work cut out for them \u2013 to present the best case to our membership and our leadership. I\u2019m confident that they\u2019re going to make a decision based on the values of the party and what New York really needs. Krieg: I tried. Mitchell: (Laughs) I mean, of course. Krieg: Paul Ryan is on his way out. The Wisconsin WFP has been a really big booster of Randy Bryce\u2019s Democratic primary campaign. How much credit do progressive organizations like WFP \u2013 as opposed to the reasons Ryan gave \u2013 deserve for his decision to go? Mitchell: There\u2019s no doubt that the decision that we made to identify Randy and support him and endorse him, and his amazing race and what he\u2019s brought to the table, was a significant contributing factor to Ryan\u2019s decision. I\u2019m really proud of the WFP identifying real progressives and running them in districts that people think progressives shouldn\u2019t run in. This is a clear example of what happens when you support real progressives in all communities. The status quo is afraid of that fight. It doesn\u2019t want to engage these questions. Somebody like Paul Ryan, who presided over the largest transfer of wealth in our generation, doesn\u2019t have an appetite to engage his constituents, especially when there\u2019s a true progressive, union member, real economic populist like Randy challenging him. It was too much to bear. We would\u2019ve loved that fight; it would\u2019ve been great if he stuck around. But he didn\u2019t have the political courage to stand behind some of the really deplorable policies that he supported and pushed through Congress. Krieg: Working Families has been pretty clear it doesn\u2019t view itself as a third party in the traditional sense. It\u2019s not interested in acting or being viewed as a spoiler. Given that you\u2019re not going to be running candidates against Democrats in general elections, what\u2019s your leverage? Mitchell: We, and you saw this in the last cycle, we\u2019re not afraid to pick fights. And when we win in primaries, we have a lot of momentum for those general election cycles. We\u2019ve been doing that in every region of the country and in a lot of places where progressives and liberals and leftists aren\u2019t supposed to win. The South, the Midwest, in Republican-leaning districts. We\u2019re very much interested in that ideological fight, and settling this argument, that doesn\u2019t bear out, that (says) during these wave moments, we need to identify the most bland, small business owner, white guy to run for Congress in a Republican leaning or working class district. We think that is a recipe for the sort of collapse we saw, especially down ballot electorally of the left. We want to pick fights, but the thing we pride ourselves in is being strategic. We\u2019re not interested in moral victories, we\u2019re not running people across the board without being able to win in very real ways that help us build upon a story of left populist multiracial politics that is viable and necessary and able to win against right-wing nationalists. Krieg: How do \u2013 and forgive me for framing it this way \u2013 but how do you get the Clinton liberals and the Sanders movement progressives on the same page. Should that be the goal, and what can the left, broadly, do to get together and win national races? Mitchell: The question that you pose here is one of the things that I\u2019m most excited about in taking on this job. I also think it\u2019s a false debate, a false choice, it\u2019s a false binary \u2013 and it\u2019s actually really dangerous, the idea that you have to choose between racial justice and economic justice. This is born from my experience building movements through the Movement for Black Lives and, previously, working on the ground as an organizer in those black, Latino and white communities, and working class and middle class communities on Long Island, as well as in urban communities. The reality is that racial and economic justice are intertwined. You can\u2019t resolve one without the other. Ultimately, what will settle this debate is us consistently winning in working class communities, urban communities, rural communities on a progressive, multiracial populist brand of politics. And on a visionary, inclusive mission. I think people are hungry for that. Krieg: You\u2019re very optimistic. Mitchell: Well, like you pointed out, among young people party identification is decreasing. If you look at all of these movements that have come up, from Occupy to the Movement for Black Lives, to the Women\u2019s March and Never Again, these are young people who are very hungry for a political home \u2013 and they don\u2019t have it. This either/or politics, it\u2019s not working for people. So (the WFP) actually wants to be a political home where people can bring their full self into the room. They could bring their racial identity and their class background and their other identities into the room and feel like their full selves can be expressed politically. I think that\u2019s the conversation and debate we\u2019re trying to engage in and settle. Krieg: I\u2019ve seen, especially with the progressive movement\u2019s influence growing, people more focused on electoral politics getting frustrated with activists, saying they need to learn to compromise more. And on the flip side, activists get frustrated with politicians who, in order to be effective, have to sometimes make compromises. Can there be peace there \u2013 should there be? Mitchell: Again, I think we\u2019re often presented with false choices, false binaries, false dichotomies. Social movements are designed to make what was previously considered impossible, possible. To shift the tectonic plates that we operate under politically, to change the meaning of and how we understand basic concepts and to resolve issues that seem intractable. Now, what I\u2019m excited about is aligning a political apparatus with social movement, so social movements can fully do their jobs. Then to have a political apparatus that can take full advantage of the space that is carved out by the social movement. When we as principled folks in social movements \u2013 leftists, liberals, progressives and other folks on the left \u2013 cede the political space to the political institutions, and only focus on outside power and only focus on protest power, what we do is carve out all of this space so that the conversation is the right conversation, but the wrong people, the wrong actors are left to settle it electorally. So, for example, with the Movement for Black Lives, the specific issues of state violence against black people are on the forefront of the political agenda. But if we don\u2019t engage in the questions of governance at all, then what we do is effectively push on the structures but then allow the Republicans and Democrats to settle the issues electorally. I\u2019m not interested in ceding that to the Republicans and Democrats. Krieg: Putting that together, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d say, requires trust. But there seems to be a trust gap between voters and Democratic or otherwise progressive politicians. How does that get fixed? Mitchell: Well, we move at the speed of trust. Everything I\u2019ve talked to you about during this conversation is impossible without a foundation of deep trust and authentic relationships. You can\u2019t phone that in. There\u2019s no amount of political contractors that people hire that can fabricate that. It\u2019s there or it\u2019s not. It\u2019s legitimate or it isn\u2019t. What excites me about the WFP is that I\u2019m working with members and party leaders around the country and a staff that gets that. The traditional political hack thinks that our brand of politics is naive. And I think they\u2019re wrong \u2013 things like trust, things like care, things like our values, where we want the world to go, these things matter. If you\u2019re simply concerned with the proximal fight of winning elections every cycle, you\u2019ll run yourself through this transactional, electoral hamster wheel, where you change every election to fit whatever political winds blow. I want to build a party that\u2019s interested in the generational fight, versus the proximal 2018, 2020 fight. Absolutely we need to win elections, but to what end? GK: What is the issue Democrats \u2013 liberals and progressives and so on \u2013 should run on in this particular election cycle? MM: I think, actually, it\u2019s a misstep for people on the left to reduce this conversation to any particular issue. State by state and district by district, there are issues candidates should be running on, absolutely, I think absolutely we have a conversation around economic inequality, and around systemic change and our economic system, that we need to be engaged in. But I also feel, apart from that, we need to see this as an existential fight for what country we want to live in. We need to elevate and expand the nature of what we\u2019re fighting for. That\u2019s one of the reasons why so many people, on the left and the right, were moved last election cycle \u2013 because you had people who were engaging larger battles and bigger conversations than some of the narrow policy conversations that can be wonky and reductive. I\u2019m excited, with the WFP, to lay out the case for a generational vision and contrasting that with apocalyptic vision the right is offering, where we have to batten down the hatches and isolate ourselves and turn on the rest of the world and turn on anybody who might not fit a very narrow, white, male, right, or center-right identity. That\u2019s where want to go and we think people are hungry for that.",

            "article_content": "A majority of Americans think President Donald Trump will lose his re-election bid in 2020, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, similar numbers to those facing former President Barack Obama at this point in his first term ahead of his re-election victory. Fifty-four percent of Americans say they expect Trump to lose his campaign for re-election, the same number who said Obama would lose the 2012 election at this point in his first term. Only 40% of Americans think Trump will win in 2020, similar to the 44% who said the same for Obama. Republicans overwhelmingly say they expect Trump to win re-election to the White House in 2020 (79% feel that way), while Democrats nearly unanimously say they expect him to lose (87% say so). A majority of independents also expect him to lose. Republicans now are more optimistic about Trump\u2019s re-election prospects than Democrats were about Obama (just 69% of Democrats said they expected Obama to win at this point in 2010). Former President Bill Clinton faced even worse expectations in 1995, when only a quarter of Americans expected him to win his second term following deep losses for his party in the 1994 midterm elections. Trump filed re-election paperwork with federal election officials on Inauguration Day in 2017. He formally announced his re-election bid in February. Trump holds strong support among his own party\u2019s potential voters in a 2020 primary race. Three-quarters of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 75%, say they think the GOP should re-nominate Trump in 2020. Only one in five, 20%, say the GOP should nominate a different candidate. These numbers are virtually identical to Obama\u2019s support among Democrats at this point in his term. Why the Biden-Trump feud of 2018 might be a preview of 2020 But when those who want to see someone else take the party\u2019s nomination are asked to name an alternative to Trump, no potential candidate has a clear edge. None of the potential nominees raised by respondents earn more than 1% support; that list includes Vice President Mike Pence, former GOP nominee Mitt Romney, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, television personality Oprah Winfrey and retiring South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy. Speculation about a Republican primary challenge has swirled around some anti-Trump GOP voices like Ohio Gov. John Kasich, outgoing Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse, who have refused to rule out a run for the White House. Former Vice President Joe Biden holds the most widespread support when potential Democratic primary voters are asked to rate the chances they would support six possible candidates for the party\u2019s 2020 nomination. A broad 84% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they are likely to support a Biden bid for the Democratic nomination, two-thirds of whom say they are \u201cvery likely\u201d to back his candidacy. Large majorities of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents also say they are likely to support Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (75%) and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (68%). Still, this support is slightly less intense than Biden\u2019s: Six in 10 likely Sanders backers say they are \u201cvery likely\u201d to support him and less than half of Warren\u2019s likely supporters say they are \u201cvery likely\u201d to support her. Both Biden, 75, and Sanders, 76, have not ruled out bids for the White House in 2020. Warren has said she isn\u2019t running. #2020Vision: Biden's beneficial brawl; Warren's health care move; Harris backs Jealous in Maryland About half of potential Democratic primary voters say they are likely to back California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. Roughly one in five say they aren\u2019t sure if they\u2019d support those latter three, lesser-known possible candidates. Only two in 10 potential Democratic voters overall say they are \u201cvery likely\u201d to back Harris and Booker; only one in 10 are \u201cvery likely\u201d to support Gillibrand. Sanders still has the strongest grip on young voters in the Democratic party: 60% of potential Democratic primary voters under 35 say they are very likely to back Sanders vs. 52% for Biden, 29% for Warren, 18% for Harris, 16% for Booker and 12% for Gillibrand. Among potential Democratic primary voters, racial divisions also play a role. Six in 10 nonwhites, 61%, say they are very likely to back Biden\u2019s candidacy vs. 52% of whites who say the same. On the flip side, 39% of whites are very likely to back Warren\u2019s bid vs. only 25% of nonwhites. The CNN poll was conducted by SSRS March 22-25 among a random national sample of 1,014 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points. It is larger for subgroups.",

            "article_content": "During the 2016 campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly declared himself the \u201claw and order candidate.\u201d He used the expression four times in his acceptance address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland and called for its restoration when speaking in the immediate aftermath of last year\u2019s deadly violence in Charlottesville. But according to a new CNN poll, conducted by SSRS, only 39% believe Trump \u201crespects the rule of law.\u201d Nearly six in 10 say he does not. Throughout his first 14 months in office, Trump and his Justice Department, headed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, have pushed for stricter sentencing across the board, including for nonviolent offenders. Last week, he proposed the death penalty for some drug dealers. Sessions backed up the President, promising to pursue capital punishment for traffickers \u201cwherever appropriate.\u201d Americans\u2019 views of Trump on this question, like so many others, are split down partisan and racial lines. Among those who approve of his job performance, 81% said he respects the rule of law; only 7% of those who disapprove said the same. There is also a considerable gap in the perceptions of whites and non-whites, with 45% and 27%, respectively, saying Trump values those standards. The President, a vocal defender of police and law enforcement in general terms, has frequently criticized federal judges, the FBI, and the Justice Department-appointed special counsel currently investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The White House has repeatedly denied reports Trump is weighing whether to order Robert Mueller\u2019s firing, but the rumors persist. Republicans in Congress, like House Speaker Paul Ryan, say the White House has offered them \u201cassurances\u201d the special counsel is safe. But just 33% of registered voters who described themselves as very enthusiastic about the prospect of voting in this fall\u2019s midterm elections have confidence in Trump\u2019s respect for the rule of law \u2013 another anxious sign for GOP officers gearing up for a dogfight to preserve their majorities.

            "article_content": "The Russia investigation, the Cambridge Analytica developments and a triptych of lawsuits concerning the President\u2019s pre-presidential relationships with and treatment of women don\u2019t have anything specifically to do with one other \u2013 other than all of them were part of the effort to elect Trump. Taken together, they do make it possible to draw a very clear conclusion: The President\u2019s allies \u2013 his family, his attorney, his campaign \u2013 were working very hard and being very creative on a variety of fronts in their efforts to hide elements of his past and to get him elected. Trump has long been obsessed with his remarkable election victory (and none of the above should suggest the outcome would have been different), but it\u2019s more than clear that what he accomplished in speaking to the angst of white working class voters was also done with meddlesome tricks by foreign powers, data harvested from the unsuspecting and cover-ups. And what we continue to learn about the 2016 election should change the way Americans view their electoral process. On Russia, even if nothing comes of the ongoing inquiry into possible collusion between the President\u2019s campaign and Russians (nothing beyond the guilty pleas by his former associates for lying to the FBI), we already know beyond doubt that his son took a meeting with Russians promising dirt on Hillary Clinton. We also know beyond doubt, because the US intelligence community has said it over and over again, that Russians were bent on hurting Clinton and, thereby, helping Trump. (And Trump\u2019s continued insistence on letting Russian President Vladimir Putin be the alpha in their interactions coupled with his attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller have not helped him.) Russian trolls tried to exploit divisions, especially racial ones, in US society. There\u2019s no specific evidence that the Russians colluded with Cambridge Analytica, the firm founded by Steve Bannon, who went on to be Trump\u2019s top strategist, and billionaire Robert Mercer. Clinton has already suggested, without evidence, they were working along the same lines as Cambridge Analytica. Facebook's data scandal: Key names to know \u201cThe real question is how did the Russians know how to target their messages so precisely to undecided voters in Wisconsin or Michigan or Pennsylvania \u2013 that is really the nub of the question,\u201d Clinton told Channel 4 News after their expose that Cambridge Analytica was open to bribery and entrapment as tactics. The company\u2019s CEO has been suspended. In response to that report on Monday, Cambridge Analytica said the report had been \u201cedited and scripted\u201d to misrepresent the nature of the conversations, and Nix denied in a statement that the company engages in entrapment or bribery. Cambridge Analytica\u2019s statement on Tuesday said an independent investigation would take place with the company revealing its findings \u201cin due course.\u201d News that the company scraped Facebook users\u2019 personal data without their knowledge has led to a crisis at the Internet giant. Employees for Cambridge Analytica have said in videos they were responsible for large portions of the Trump campaign. A Bloomberg story published in October 2016 quoted a senior Trump campaign official as saying the campaign\u2019s strategy was one of \u201cvoter suppression\u201d in key areas, raising questions about Clinton with people who might be ready to vote for her. That sounds more appropriately like under the radar negative campaigning. It could have made the difference in Florida and the Rust Belt. The other thing we know for sure is that Trump\u2019s attorney was working hard to cover up alleged affairs. That may be the least nefarious thing since most Americans might not be surprised about the thrice-married President\u2019s personal life. But the twin six-figure payments to porn star Stormy Daniels (by Trump\u2019s attorney Michael Cohen) and Playboy model Karen McDougal (by the Trump-friendly company that owns the National Enquirer) show that his allies were trying hard to keep at least some skeletons in the closet in the run-up to Election Day. 3 Trump-related lawsuits: Porn star, Playboy model, harassment accuser The sketchiness of American politics is obviously not one-sided. Trump\u2019s Democratic opponents funded the dossier with unsubstantiated claims about his possible ties to Russia and his personal life. It wasn\u2019t released as part of the campaign, but it has seen the light of day. Similarly, Barack Obama\u2019s campaigns found ways to harness voter data from Facebook and use it to their advantage. Rather than face privacy concerns, they have given Ted Talks to brag about their exploits in marketing their candidate online. None of what we\u2019ve learned about Trump and his campaign and, separately, Russian meddling, means Trump didn\u2019t speak to a very important voting bloc that turned out for him. None of it means he didn\u2019t win white women despite the accusations of harassment by more than a dozen women before Election Day. None of that means he didn\u2019t send the GOP reeling with comments almost universally decried as racist about Mexicans and his targeting of a US judge\u2019s heritage. Voters in the right places found a way to get beyond his many failings \u2013 the ones they knew about \u2013 and vote for Trump anyway. But the emerging picture of what they didn\u2019t know and the fake stories they saw in their social media feeds means his victory will always have a very bold asterisk.",

            "article_content": "The Senate on Wednesday passed sweeping changes to a swath of rules adopted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The measure crafted by Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, passed 67 to 31, marking a rare occurrence of old-fashioned legislating on a bipartisan bill that nevertheless sharply divided Democrats. The legislation will now move to the House, where it will need to be reconciled with possible fixes proposed by Rep. Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. A White House press secretary said in a statement that President Donald Trump supports Crapo\u2019s bill and would sign it into law. Still, the White House left the door open to possible changes that could be made by House lawmakers as long as the bipartisan bill reaches the president\u2019s desk \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d The proposal provides long-awaited relief to thousands of community banks and dozens of regional lenders including Zions Bancorp, BB&T and SunTrust. It will also loosen regulations for mortgage lenders, expand access to free credit freezes for Americans and change rules for student loan defaults. \u201cThis bill shows that we can work together and can do big things that make a big difference in the lives of people across this country,\u201d said Crapo on the Senate floor ahead of the vote. The bill\u2019s passage was a defeat for progressive Democrats, who strongly opposed easing regulations for some banks, warning that doing so would likely trigger another financial crisis. RELATED: What\u2019s in the Senate banking bill \u201cThis legislation threatens to undo important rules protecting us from risk,\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the banking panel, said earlier this week on the Senate floor. \u201cThis legislation again puts taxpayers on the hook for bailouts.\u201d Progressives pointed to several critical changes in the bill that would release more than two dozen regional banks from stricter oversight by the Fed and would make it easier for Wall Street banks to fight off existing regulations. \u201cBuried down in the details of the bill are more landmines for American families\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, said on the Senate floor ahead of the chamber\u2019s vote. \u201cWashington has become completely disconnected from the real problem in people\u2019s lives.\u201d Warren: 'Don't see how any senator' can vote for Wall Street deregulation The bill raises the threshold at which banks are considered too big to fail. That trigger, once set at $50 billion in assets, would rise to $250 billion. It would leave only a dozen US banks \u2013 including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo \u2013 facing the strictest regulations. The measure would also shield more than two dozen banks from some Fed oversight under the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory law. Those banks would no longer be required to have plans to be safely dismantled if they fail. And they would have to take the Fed\u2019s bank health test only periodically, not once a year. Moderate Democrats accused progressives of overstating provisions in the bill and the likely impact it could have on the economy. Instead, they argued they have to respond to the distinct political and banking needs in their states, which they say have been hurt by consolidation in the banking industry since the law was passed. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand where we live,\u201d said Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, a moderate Democrat from North Dakota who is up for re-election, on the chamber floor. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand who we are. They don\u2019t understand we live in communities and that we support and protect each other. Instead, they write one regulation that\u2019s supposed to be one-size-fits-all.\u201d Many of the measure\u2019s Democratic cosponsors hail from rural states won by Trump. Their support for the long-sought changes may demonstrate to their voters, many who voted for Trump, that they can work with the President and not reflexively oppose anything he supports. Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s vote, Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, defended his support for the bill, arguing he would never back remedies that would put the financial system at risk. \u201cLet me be clear that I will do nothing and support no legislation that seriously undermines or cuts back on the provisions and the systemic protections that were put in place,\u201d Warner said on the chamber floor. \u201cBut eight years later \u2026 there is widespread agreement that some of the standards we set in Dodd-Frank needed time for review.\u201d Those cap changes include exempting community banks with $10 billion or less in assets from having to comply with the so-called Volcker Rule, a regulation that bars financial institutions from making risky bets with money insured by taxpayers. It also stops banks that originate 500 or fewer mortgages each year from having to collect racial data on their loans. Under a 1975 law, financial institutions are required to report the race, ethnicity and ZIP codes of borrowers so regulators can make sure they aren\u2019t discriminating in lending. Some new consumer protections were also added to the bill including offering Americans free credit freezes and barring lenders from declaring a student loan in default when a co-signer dies or declares bankruptcy. RELATED: Why are (some) Democrats signing on to the Republican bank bill? It\u2019s not just progressives who\u2019ve highlighted negative consequences from the changes to the bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office weighed in with its take on Monday, before the initial vote, and came to the conclusion that the bill, if passed, would increase the chances of another 2008-style collapse. \u201cCBO\u2019s estimate of the bill\u2019s budgetary effect is subject to considerable uncertainty, in part because it depends on the probability in any year that a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) will fail or that there will be a financial crisis,\u201d the report states, before adding the caveat: \u201cCBO estimates that the probability is small under current law and would be slightly greater under the legislation.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump trades on identity politics, and that is what he\u2019s doing with Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Though the angle is different, it\u2019s reminiscent of his earlier remarks about Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate. In both cases, Trump is using their identities against them. You can tell at this point that Warren has had practice answering questions about her claims of Native American heritage because the Massachusetts Democrat been replying the same way for years. Six years ago, when Warren first faced questions about her heritage and the accusation \u2013 which she has repeatedly denied \u2013 that she may have traded on having Native American ancestry for career advancement, she answered pretty much exactly the same way she answers now. Here\u2019s what Warren said in a TV ad released by her Senate campaign in 2012, when her opponent, then-Sen. Scott Brown, a Massachusetts Republican, was raising the issue and demanding she release proof, somehow, of her Native American roots. It was among his main lines of attack against her. \u201cAs a kid, I never asked my mom for documentation when she talked about our Native American heritage. What kid would? But I knew my father\u2019s family didn\u2019t like that she was part Cherokee and part Delaware, so they had to elope. The Boston Globe did exhaustive work back then drilling down into Warren\u2019s career as a law professor and whether she indeed got any benefit from portraying herself as Native American. Here we are six years later, Warren is running for re-election to her Senate seat and is an oft-discussed possible presidential contender in 2020, and her heritage is still the subject of questions. On Sunday, she was asked on NBC about a demand by a Massachusetts newspaper that she submit to a DNA test that would, presumably, be able to determine if she has any Native American blood. She answered with more of her childhood. \u201cMy daddy first saw my mother when they were both teenagers. He fell in love with this tall, quiet girl who played the piano. Head over heels. But his family was bitterly opposed to their relationship because she was part Native American. They eventually eloped. \u2026 And that\u2019s the story that my brothers and I all learned from our mom and our dad, from our grandparents, from all of our aunts and uncles. It\u2019s a part of me, and nobody\u2019s going to take that part of me away.\u201d She told the same story, essentially, to CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Sunday, when he asked about Trump\u2019s \u201cPocahontas\u201d nickname for her. Warren responds to Trump's 'Pocahontas' slur On CNN, she went a step further and said she had told Native American leaders she would use the ribbing from Trump against him: \u201cEvery time President Trump wants to throw out some kind of racial slur, he wants to try to attack me, I\u2019m going to use it as a chance to lift up their stories.\u201d She then said that more than half of Native American women in this country have been the victims of sexual violence, often by non-Natives. She said the federal government should do more about that. In both interviews Sunday, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not running for president,\u201d but she also would not pledge on NBC to serve another full six-year term. Read more from CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza on that particular word choice from her. If she does run for President, you can bet you\u2019re going to hear that story about her heritage a lot more. The anatomy of her answer is to ignore the question asking for some sort of proof that she\u2019s Native American and rather to explain that this was the story she was told and so that\u2019s what she grew up believing. Anything beyond that, she\u2019s suggesting, isn\u2019t really important if she didn\u2019t get any benefit during her career from portraying herself as Native American. There\u2019s no direct evidence she did get a benefit, by the way, although Harvard Law School\u2019s PR department would mention her when they were asked about diversity. It took some time back in 2012 for her to find the appropriate way to answer. She raised eyebrows at one point back then when she talked about her grandfather\u2019s high cheekbones. But ever since settling on what amounts to the that\u2019s the story I was told defense, Warren has stuck to it. Sunday\u2019s question from NBC isn\u2019t the first time someone has suggested Warren take a DNA test; Brown said the same in 2016. Here\u2019s Warren speaking to Anderson Cooper in November of 2017, frustrated at Trump calling her Pocahontas during a code talker event at the White House. Warren on Trump comment: I couldn't believe it \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s going to shut me down with that,\u201d she said. Stoking questions about a rival\u2019s heritage is nothing new for Trump. But while the birtherism against Obama was treated with frustration and disdain by Obama\u2019s staff, Warren seems to be trying something different and instead using the issue against the President. There are differences, obviously. Trump and other birther conspiracy theorists were trying to question the legitimacy of a sitting President. With Warren, Trump is trying to typecast a potential 2020 rival. In neither case is disproving the criticisms likely to quiet the critics. Obama released his long-form birth certificate in 2011. Trump admitted Obama was born in the US years later, in 2016, although he still has his doubts, according to some reports. The point is that these side controversies have a way of coming back again and again. That will be doubly true if Trump continues to call Warren \u201cPocahontas.\u201d (Is there any question he won\u2019t?) That Warren isn\u2019t even trying to dismiss it anymore suggests she realizes she needs to be ready for the long haul.",

Because my family\u2019s story is deeply a part of me and a part of my brothers,\u201d Warren said. \u201cIt\u2019s what we learned from our parents. It\u2019s what we learned from our grandparents. It\u2019s what we learned from our aunts and uncles. \u201cI went to speak to Native American tribal leaders and I made a promise to them that every time President Trump wants to try to throw out some kind of racial slur, he wants to attack me, I\u2019m going to use it as a chance to lift up their stories,\u201d she added. While speaking at a campaign rally in western Pennsylvania Saturday night, President Trump brought back his derisive nickname for Warren.

Can you imagine covering Bernie or Pocahontas? Pocahontas, how about that?\u201d The lawmaker said the same thing about her political future to Chuck Todd of NBC News in an interview for \u201cMeet the Press\u201d when pressed about her Senate re-election campaign and her pledge to fulfill her six-year term. \u201cFor the people of Massachusetts, and for the people across this country,\u201d Warren said. \u201cThis government is working better and better and better for a thinner and thinner slice at the top. I am in these fights, and I am in this fight to retain my Senate seat in 2018. That\u2019s where I\u2019m focused. That\u2019s where I\u2019m going to stay focused.

            "article_content": "\u201cTouched by the spirit of history.\u201d It\u2019s how congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, told 16-year-old Charlotte Potes she should describe her pull toward activism to her skeptical parents. It was also how every one of us on last weekend\u2019s remarkable civil rights pilgrimage felt: touched by the spirit of history. The Faith and Politics Institute organizes a bipartisan delegation to take this trip every year around the March 7 anniversary of a 1965 march across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, by protesters calling for African-Americans to have the right to register to vote. Lewis, who was beaten by white police so badly that fateful day that they broke his skull, leads the pilgrimage. \u201cI remember so well the moment that I was beaten and left at the foot of the bridge. I thought I was going to die. I thought I saw death. I thought it was the last march,\u201d Lewis told me, while standing on the bridge where he shed so much blood. A post shared by Dana Bash (@danabashcnn) \u201cFifty-three years later, I don\u2019t know how I made it back across this bridge, but apparently a group of individuals literally took me across the bridge, back to the church where we left from. But I do remember being back at the church and someone asked me to say something to the audience, and I stood up and said something like, \u2018I don\u2019t understand it. How President Johnson can send troops to Vietnam and cannot send troops to Selma, Alabama, to protect people who only desires to register to vote?\u2019\u201d Lewis recalled under such a blue sky and peaceful day, it was hard to imagine the violence that took place under our feet. \u201cThis is the place they gave us the Voting Rights Act, made it possible for hundreds and thousands and millions of people to be able to participate in the democratic process.\u201d A post shared by Dana Bash (@danabashcnn) That kind of activism \u2013 marching to demand something different from the government \u2013 took on a new meaning this year as the country watches the organic student movement forming in the wake of last month\u2019s school massacre of 17 people \u2013 mostly teenagers \u2013 in Parkland, Florida. They want something that seems as basic as the right to vote: the right to be safe at school. \u201cI see so much hope, so much of our future in this new movement,\u201d Lewis told me, still standing on that bridge in Selma. \u201cI say to the young people and young leaders, just give it all you got,\u201d Lewis advised today\u2019s student protesters. \u201cDo not get weary. Be hopeful. Be optimistic and take the long hard look. We had some difficulties. They will have some difficulties. They will have some setbacks. But you can\u2019t give up. You cannot give in.\u201d Current events collided with this walk through history all throughout the remarkable pilgrimage. Every speaker, from Peggy Wallace Kennedy, daughter of infamous segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace, to Martin Luther King III spoke of the hope they see in the youth of today. \u201cMany are very, very proud of the young people in Parkland, who are leading, not following, and waiting for something to happen. These are high school students, I have a lot of faith in young people,\u201d King said. Rep. Barbara Lee, a California Democrat, brought a group of students from her home district of Oakland, who are involved with the Martin Luther King Jr. Freedom Center there. Two teenagers, Potes and David Gaines, blew all of us grown-ups away. Potes had a powerful question for Lewis: \u201cThere are a lot of 13, 14, 15 year olds who want to be involved in the movement and in the work that you do and that we all do. And they want to be warriors for justice but they can\u2019t, because some of our parents are frightened when they speak up and they don\u2019t know what it means.\u201d Members of both parties annually embark on this pilgrimage, and one of the fascinating parts of this experience, as a reporter who covers the daily partisan vitriol in Washington, was to watch it slip away as the plane touched down at our first stop in Memphis, Tennessee, and remain that way at least until we were wheels up from Montgomery, Alabama, three days later. A post shared by Dana Bash (@danabashcnn) House Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers brought several African-Americans from her home district in Spokane, Washington. She called it part of a journey she is on to better understand them, and vice versa, after an incident of racial graffiti following the 2016 election. Her district is no more than 2% African-American, but she said she wants to learn, and the trip clearly went a long way towards helping do that. The climax for her, no doubt, as it was for all of us was locking arms with Democrat John Lewis and walking across the Edmund Pettus Bridge with him \u2013 not as opposing members of Congress, but as students and teachers, retracing steps of epic struggle for equality with a man who led the way all those years ago. A post shared by Dana Bash (@danabashcnn) Other Republican congress members, such as Tom Rooney of Florida and Susan Brooks of Indiana, joined in that life changing experience as well, closing the partisan divide by walking along side Democratic colleagues from House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer to first-term Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California. \u201cIt gives me inspiration to remember the struggles that so many have faced and so we are yet in another period where we must struggle for civil rights. For everyone to have an equal voice and be given equal opportunity,\u201d said Harris, the sole female African-American senator in the chamber. Touched by the spirit of history. They all were. You could see it on their faces. Because April marks 50 years since Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated, this year\u2019s civil rights pilgrimage started in Memphis. The first stop for our group, which included about a dozen bipartisan members of Congress, was the Mason Temple, where King delivered his famous \u201cmountaintop\u201d speech the night before he was killed. Greeting us as we entered the famous church was a gospel choir so good and so powerful, it was impossible not to immediately get swept up in the moment, and the history of where we were all standing. It was also the first introduction to what we would be treated to throughout the entire weekend: stories from the people who lived it. The people who shed blood, sweat and tears for equality. A post shared by Dana Bash (@danabashcnn) Here, it was Elmore Nickleberry, a Memphis sanitation worker who joined the strike in 1968 to demand the same pay and benefits as white workers. King was in Memphis to support those workers when he was killed. Then, on the church audio system, the voice of King. \u201cI have seen the promised land,\u201d we heard him say, as we all sat and looked at the empty pulpit where he actually delivered that speech. For me, the only thing more powerful than that was later \u2013 actually standing on that pulpit. The wave of emotion that I felt standing there is something I did not expect, and will never forget. Next it was on to the Lorraine Motel, where King was shot to death. It is now a civil rights museum, but room 306, where King was staying, was left exactly as it was at 6 a.m. April 4, 1968, when he was killed on the balcony outside. The breakfast remnants. His vanity case by the sink. A newspaper splashing headlines about Vietnam on the bed. Outside, a woman broke into song as lawmakers who came from Washington, displayed the first of many bipartisan shows of unity and respect. Lewis was pushing back tears when he stood in the motel parking lot and recalled first hearing about King when he was a 15-year-old boy living in rural Alabama, then actually meeting him when he was 18. \u201cI remember hearing Dr. King\u2019s voice. In 1955 when I was 15 years old. Growing up in rural Alabama. Then in 1958, at the age of 18 I met him. He changed my life. He inspired me to stand up. To speak up. To never give up.\u201d A post shared by Dana Bash (@danabashcnn) From there it was wheels up to Birmingham, Alabama, known in the 1950s and 60s as \u201cBombingham\u201d because so many black churches and homes were blown up by the Klu Klux Klan. The most infamous of those bombings was the 16th Street Baptist Church on September 15, 1963. Four little girls were killed doing nothing more than attending Sunday school. Again, the Faith and Politics Institute assembled a group that allowed us to learn this painful history from those who lived it. Then 16-year-old Carolyn McKinstry had been in the church basement minutes before the bomb went off, and had just been talking to the girls who were killed seconds before they died. It is something that obviously scarred her for life, but now Reverend Doctor McKinstry says she took that trauma and funneled it into a lifetime of work helping people overcome hate. A post shared by Dana Bash (@danabashcnn) That evening I interviewed Alabama\u2019s new Democratic senator, Doug Jones. He won with the help of overwhelming turnout from African-Americans, and the story of what he did helps explain why. When he became US attorney during the Clinton administration, only one of the four suspects of the bombing was ever brought to justice. That was in 1977, 14 years after it happened. In 1997, 24 years after the 16th street Baptist church bombing, Jones began to prosecute two suspects still living. In a remarkable twist that you usually only see in the movies, Jones won one conviction because he found an old, forgotten FBI recording of KKK member Thomas Blanton discussing his plans to bomb the church with his then-wife. Blanton was convicted in 2001, Bobby Frank Cherry, in 2002. All of that, was only on Day 1. Day 2 was Montgomery, Alabama\u2019s state Capitol where so many of the clashes, the bloodshed, and the racism spilled onto the streets. First stop: Dexter Avenue Church, where Martin Luther King, Jr. preached as a young man \u2013 and where he first got involved in the civil rights movement which quickly made him its leader. Remarkably, this church \u2013 where King and his allies began to plot the Montgomery bus boycott, is only a block from the state Capitol. It literally sits in the shadow of the big white dome. And just around the corner, one of the most famous moments of American history took place: Rosa Parks refused to sit in the back of the bus, as Jim Crow laws required for blacks. The theme of this day was the children of the civil rights movement. So who came to preach at the Dexter Avenue church? Martin Luther King III. \u201cI was 10 years old when dad was killed, but while we had a great loss I think the nation gleamed an incredible message and an understanding of a movement that transformed this nation.\u201d Also there was Kennedy, the daughter of the Alabama governor who was the segregationist antagonist of the civil rights movement. She has spent most of her adult life trying to right the wrongs of her father. In a stunningly eloquent manner, she tries to explain why Wallace spewed so much hatred, why he stood at the schoolhouse door to stop black children from entering. He was trying to hold onto power and at that time, that meant appealing to and appeasing whites \u2013 the only ones really allowed to vote. \u201cMartin Luther King dedicated his life to justice; my father, until the twilight of his life, dedicated his life to power,\u201d she said. \u201cDr. King used his power to fulfill a dream for mankind.\u201d Kennedy said after her father was shot and spent his twilight years pain, he finally understand the pain he caused blacks across Alabama. \u201cMy father came unannounced in his later years, and came into the church, went to the front of the church in his wheelchair, and asked the African American community for their forgiveness for the suffering and pain that he had caused them, during his governing time.\u201d Imagine this: Sitting in the front of a bus with John Lewis as you approach the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Watching him sitting silently, and only imagining the flood of memories in his mind. That\u2019s what I got to experience. Being with Lewis on the bridge, listening to him talk, learning from him, is something every single person on that pilgrimage voraciously tried to eat up. Grab every morsel of his essence, and try so hard not to forgot even a second. I know I won\u2019t. I am so grateful for this experience, as are my CNN colleagues, Bridget Nolan and Jeremy Moorhead, who traveled with me. Life changing does not even begin to describe it.

            "article_content": "Michael Steele shot back Saturday at a Conservative Political Action Conference official for a racial comment he made about the former Republican National Committee chairman at a dinner Friday night. At the Ronald Reagan dinner, CPAC communications director Ian Walters said Steele was elected RNC chair \u201cbecause he\u2019s a black guy.\u201d \u201cWe were somewhat lost as a group, we had just elected the first African-American president, and that was a big deal and that was a hill that we got over and it was something that we were all proud of and we weren\u2019t sure what to do, and in a little bit of cynicism what did we do? This is a terrible thing. We elected Mike Steele to be the RNC chair because he\u2019s a black guy, that was the wrong thing to do,\u201d Walters said. Steele told MSNBC on Friday that Walters called him and tried to apologize, but he rejected the apology. \u201cHe did call and he tried to explain himself and said what he was thinking, he relayed it back to Barack Obama\u2019s election, and then he said at one point, \u2018I apologize,\u2019 and I just said, you know, that\u2019s just not acceptable, that\u2019s not enough,\u201d Steele recalled. Walters did not immediately return CNN\u2019s request for comment on Saturday. According to the news outlet Observer, Steele called the remark \u201cpainfully stupid.\u201d \u201cI wanted to talk to [CPAC chair] Matt Schlapp first, but I think it\u2019s painfully stupid what he said,\u201d Steele told Observer. \u201cIf he feels that way I\u2019d like him to come say that to my face. And then I\u2019d like him to look at my record and see what I did. I can\u2019t believe an official of CPAC would go on stage, in front of an audience, and say something like that. I\u2019ve been a strong supporter of CPAC for many years, and I thought they raised them better than that here.\u201d Steele, who co-hosts the SiriusXM radio show \u201cSteele and Ungar,\u201d also discussed the comment on their show Saturday morning. \u201cI asked a quick question in a session about my own story and journey as a young 17-year-old growing up in Washington, D.C., and what drew me to the Republican Party,\u201d Steele said. \u201cThe question I have today is, what would a 17-year-old African-American male or female think about the Republican Party in joining it in 2018?\u201d Steele, who was elected the first African-American to serve as the head of the RNC in 2009, continued: \u201cIt does reflect a certain attitude that folks inside the party are seemingly more comfortable with right now.\u201d \u201cIt also goes to insulting not just me \u2013 I mean, I can deal with that, I\u2019m a big boy, put my pants on and go into the fight \u2013 but it goes after everyone in the RNC who knew me and worked with me and supported the effort that I undertook to become chairman,\u201d he added. \u201cBut even more broadly, it insults every African-American and calls into question their personal accomplishments.\u201d The Friday night dinner was part of CPAC, an annual political conference attended by conservative activists and politicians taking place this week outside of Washington at the National Harbor in Maryland.",

            "article_content": "The debate over guns in America has been renewed following the mass shooting in Florida on Wednesday. The discussion has followed a familiar script, with Democrats wanting to enact gun control and Republicans tending to focus on mental health issues. As the discussion rages on, keep in mind the following five facts about gun ownership in this country. There is no countrywide database where people register whether they own guns (the law doesn\u2019t allow it). We have to rely on surveys instead. High quality telephone polls from Gallup and the Pew Research Center in 2017 found that 42% of people in the US live in households with guns. According to the General Social Survey, which has a much higher response rate than telephone polls and interviews people in person, a relatively lower 32% of Americans said in 2016 that they lived in household with guns. The gap between telephone and GSS surveys has existed in some form for 20 years, so it isn\u2019t just a one-off difference. It\u2019s not clear which datasets are more correct. The GSS, with its high response rate, is generally thought of as the gold standard survey in understanding social trends in America. It is conceivable, though, that people may not want to admit to owning guns to people who are standing in front of them. Households with guns are considerably down from previous decades. In surveys conducted in the first half of the 1990s, Gallup discovered that on average 48% of Americans lived in households with guns. The GSS showed a similar 45% during that stretch. Since that time, Gallup has found an average of 41% of households with at least one gun compared with 35% of the GSS. Both of those are within a few percentage points of the average for this decade (41% for Gallup and 33% for the GSS). In other words, there was a sharp trend downward in gun ownership during the 1990s, which has since stopped. So far we\u2019ve looked mostly at households with guns in them. That\u2019s because pollsters will most often ask Americans whether or not they live in households with guns. That\u2019s clearly different than a person owning a gun him or herself, however. According to the 2017 Pew study, 30% of Americans own guns themselves (12 points lower than the 42% who live in households with guns). For Gallup, it was 29% (13 points lower than the 42% who live in households with guns). The GSS pegs it even lower \u2013 only 21% of Americans said they personally own guns (11 points lower than the 32% who live in households with guns). Both the GSS and Pew surveys find that it\u2019s women who are more likely to be the people who don\u2019t personally own guns but live in households with weapons. In fact, the GSS found that only a little more than a third of women in households with guns own one. Pew put it at a little more than half. Among men, both surveys determined that around 90% who live in households with guns own one. Both Pew in 2017 and the GSS in 2016 asked gun owners whether they owned a handgun (pistol in the case of the GSS), rifle or shotgun. The GSS and Pew polls each found that a little over 70% of gun owners had handguns, while a lower percentage owned rifles or shotguns. Even for a shotgun though, which both surveys found to be the least common to be owned, a majority of gun owners in both the GSS (63%) and the Pew polls (54%) said they had one. That gets to another key point: Gun owners like to own many guns. According to Pew, about two-thirds of gun owners have multiple guns. That\u2019s how you end up in a country where there\u2019s about a gun per person, even though only a third or less of people actually own guns themselves. Republicans are more likely to own guns than Democrats. Whites are more likely to own guns than blacks. Men are more likely to own guns than women. People in urban areas are more likely to own guns than those in rural areas. But while some of the gaps on who owns a gun generally match the partisan gap (as measured by  2016 presidential vote patterns), other gaps are smaller than you might expect given the great political divide on whether the country needs tighter gun control. In the 2017 Pew data, for example, there was a 25 percentage point gap between the Democrats (16%) who owned guns and the Republicans (41%) who did. That\u2019s far smaller than the 80 point difference between how many Democrats (8%) and Republicans (88%) voted for Trump in the 2016 exit poll. Additionally, the racial gap on gun ownership is smaller than you might expect. According to Pew, 24% of blacks own guns and 36% of whites do. In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won 57% of white voters compared with just 8% of blacks.",

The justices granted a request to put on hold state legislative remedial maps in Wake County and Mecklenburg County. Those maps were drawn by a court-appointed special master earlier this year after a lower court held that some of the districts in earlier maps amounted to a racial gerrymander. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling means that maps drawn by Republicans for those counties  in 2017 are likely to be used in the next election. The ruling is a only a partial victory for the lawmakers, however, because the justices declined a request to put on hold maps for four other districts. Two justices, conservatives Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, would have granted the lawmakers a full stay of their request. Two liberals, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, would have denied the request in its entirety. Voting rights groups had accused Republicans of \u201cseeking a stay of the district court\u2019s remedial order so that they can hang on to the fruits of their racial gerrymander labor for at least one more year. \u201c",

            "article_content": "George Popson, a Republican from El Paso, Texas, has always been a football fan. He enjoyed watching NFL games and rooting for the Houston Texans and the Los Angeles Chargers. But this season, Popson has boycotted the NFL and he says it\u2019s all because of President Donald Trump. The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country! .@NFL: Too much talk, not enough action. Stand for the National Anthem. \u201cI stopped watching football this current NFL season after President Trump made his remark about team owners kicking out and firing any player who kneeled during the National Anthem,\u201d the 56-year-old told CNN. \u201c\u2026 I will continue to boycott NFL games and if I happen to be found in front of the TV during the Super Bowl, it will only be because I am at a Super Bowl party with food\u00a0and\u00a0drink\u00a0and more importantly, friends and family. I won\u2019t be focused on the game. Patriotism factors into this decision one hundred percent.\u201d Popson said that although he agrees \u201cthat people of color are targeted more and unjustly by law enforcement,\u201d the football field is not the place to make this statement. This may very well go down in history as the season that changed football. The President of the United States declared a political war on some of the most visible players. And he wouldn\u2019t let it go. In an off-the-cuff speech at a rally in Alabama in September, the President unleashed a highly public crusade against black players who took a knee during the National Anthem to protest institutionalized racism and police brutality. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s remarks on this issue definitely increased the number of NFL players who take a knee during the anthem.\u201d George Popson Trump lambasted team owners for allowing the protests to take place, urged fans to walk out of games and told owners they should respond to the protesting players by saying, \u201cGet that son of a bitch off the field right now, he\u2019s fired. He\u2019s fired!\u201d The President\u2019s comments launched the National Football League, which has generally managed to keep politics at bay, into a heated and highly public debate on racism and patriotism in America. At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up. The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem. Weak and out of control! That weekend, owners, coaches and players of various teams joined hands and collectively took a knee in a remarkable and unprecedented show of defiance. And there\u2019s no sign that Trump \u2013 who kept coming back to the issue on Twitter throughout the football season and even, obliquely, during his State of the Union address Tuesday \u2013 is letting up. He made a spectacular patriotic show of going down on the field for the NCAA championship game in January, standing there for the National Anthem. But he\u2019s opting out of the traditional presidential pre-Super Bowl interview this year. Last year he sat down with Bill O\u2019Reilly, then of Fox News. This year NBC is broadcasting the game. Marshawn Lynch of the NFL\u2019s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down. \u201cBecause (Trump) is this polarizing figure who chose to draw a line in the sand, it just shone a spotlight on the debate and gave it a kind of national profile that it might not have had if he hadn\u2019t actually entered the fray,\u201d Dr. Theresa Runstedtler, a history professor at American University who studies the intersection of sports, race and politics, told CNN. Trump forced coaches and owners to pick sides. .@NFL: Too much talk, not enough action. Stand for the National Anthem. New York Giants owners John Mara and Steve Tisch expressed disappointment over the President\u2019s comments. Meanwhile, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, after an early show of support, taking a knee with players before the National Anthem during a game, later sparked boycotts when he said he would bench players for \u201cbeing disrespectful to the flag.\u201d Amid the upheaval, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell tried to have it both ways. He said the league wants players to stand for the anthem but stopped short of saying the NFL would institute an NBA-like policy that would force them to stand or penalize them if they don\u2019t. However, it\u2019s important to note that despite the fact that NBA players did not participate in protests on the court, coaches and players \u2013 from stars like the Cleveland Cavaliers\u2019 LeBron James and the Golden State Warriors\u2019 Steph Curry to coaches like Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr \u2013 have been more outspoken and public in their criticism of Trump. Why athletes are getting more political in the age of Trump \u201c(Trump) created a situation where that veneer of the invisibility of politics and the invisibility of race in the Super Bowl has been shattered in a lot of ways,\u201d Runstedtler said. \u201cRegardless of which side you\u2019re on, you kind of have to actually confront the fact that the event is laden with racial politics.\u201d A group against the protests called \u201cStanding for America\u201d has nearly 300,000 followers on Facebook, and so far 26,000 people indicated they will participate in their event, \u201cNFL Boycott \u2013 2018 Super Bowl,\u201d to voice their support for veterans. And as the Philadelphia Eagles prepare to take on the New England Patriots \u2013 Trump\u2019s favorite team, given his friendly relationship with owner Robert Kraft, his golfing relationship with Tom Brady and the notes he\u2019s exchanged with Bill Belichick \u2013 at the Super Bowl this weekend, Eagles wide receiver Torrey Smith, who raised his fist on the field to express solidarity with the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement, has already indicated that he will refuse an invitation to the White House if his team wins. Even before Trump got into a fight with the NFL, sparking a boycott by conservatives, a boycott of the league among progressive and black activists was already in full swing. In Greensboro, North Carolina, a group of young activists started a \u201cKickball for Kaepernick\u201d league to protest the perceived shunning by league owners and coaches of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. \u201cI was an avid football watcher before I began my boycott against the NFL and its repression of Kaepernick and the league\u2019s contempt for those who demand justice and an end to state violence against working class communities of color,\u201d Demetrius Noble, a 38-year-old professor, told CNN. \u201cI was an avid football watcher before I began my boycott against the NFL and its repression of Kaepernick and the league\u2019s contempt for those who demand justice.\u201d Demetrius Noble \u201cI have been and am boycotting the NFL because of the structural racism that apparently permeates throughout a league that is majority black and because of the lack of attention paid to state sanctioned violence on the part of the NFL,\u201d LaKeisha\u00a0Williams, a Philadelphia Eagles fan who is part of the league, told CNN. When Kaepernick took a knee during the National Anthem in September 2016 to protest racism, he quickly became one of the most controversial figures in sports, like several others before him, and sparked a wave of protests on the field that spread from professional football to college and high school and even to other sports. But according to Runstedtler, Trump elevated Kaepernick\u2019s national profile. \u201cIf nobody had made a big deal out of it and turned it into a spectacle the protests would have been meaningless,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was actually the backlash against (Kaepernick) not standing for the anthem that ironically rained more awareness about (why he was protesting).\u201d One month before he picked a fight with the NFL over the protests, Trump had stoked racial tensions deeply when he repeatedly appeared to suggest there\u2019s a moral equivalency between white supremacists and those who oppose them while responding to violence that erupted at a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cI have been and am boycotting the NFL because of the structural racism that apparently permeates throughout a league that is majority black.\u201d LaKeisha\u00a0Williams, a Philadelphia Eagles Fan \u201cHis commentary just provided additional talking points and reinforcement concerning how the highest office of the USA is out to repress and castigate those who dare to stand for justice and the most vulnerable,\u201d Noble said, adding that Trump\u2019s rhetoric \u201creinforces why Kaepernick chose to kneel\u201d in the first place. The President\u2019s comments \u2013 upon which he doubled and tripled down \u2013 prompted an onslaught of bipartisan criticism and fueled a barrage of new protests on the field. \u201cAthletes, especially black athletes, realize that no matter how much money you make and how famous you are, when we have a president who constantly diminishes you and your people, it\u2019s time to step up and do something,\u201d NBA legend and civil rights activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar told CNN\u2019s #GetPolitical at the time. Amid bipartisan outrage over Trump\u2019s response to the violence that transpired at the rally, about a dozen members of the Cleveland Browns, including Seth DeValve \u2013 the first white player to join the protest \u2013 took a knee and prayed before a preseason game against the New York Giants on August 21. It doesn\u2019t help at all that Trump\u2019s all-time favorite team \u2013 the New England Patriots \u2013 has been so dominant. Last year, football fans compared the\u00a0Patriots\u2019 historic\u00a0comeback against the Atlanta Falcons in the Super Bowl to Trump\u2019s unexpected win against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election. What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow! At the time, the President congratulated the Patriots and his \u201cfriend\u201d quarterback Tom Brady, tweeting, \u201cWhat an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots. Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and coach B are total winners. Wow! #SuperBowl.\u201d But Brady, who had received backlash in 2015 when a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat was spotted in his locker, has been evasive when asked about his relationship with the President. Patriots Super Bowl comeback echoes 2016 race: 'Hillary lost all over again' And in a highly publicized move that likely embarrassed Trump \u2013 although the President chose not to address it publicly \u2013 the five-time Super Bowl champion surprised many when he skipped his team\u2019s visit to the White House last year, citing \u201cfamily matters.\u201d At the time, the Boston Herald reported that Brady was spending time with his mother, who was battling an illness later revealed to be breast cancer. Several of Brady\u2019s teammates had refused to go for the White House visit, citing their opposition to Trump. The smaller attendance by the Patriots for Trump than for former President Barack Obama, when he had hosted the team, drew scrutiny and an excuse from the team. #Patriots for National Anthem today #WBZ pic.twitter.com/7ZkGn0Ns5o And two days after Trump urged owners to fire players who won\u2019t stand for the anthem, the Patriots took a stand against Trump. Three dozen players took a knee, while the rest locked arms on the field. Trump put the Patriots in the political spotlight repeatedly over the past two year,\u00a0announcing\u00a0a day before the general election that Brady and coach Belichick were supporting his campaign for president. Tom Brady skips WH visit, cites 'family matters' The President also said at a pre-inaugural dinner that Brady and Patriots owner Kraft called to congratulate him. While he did not deny it, Brady played down the claim during an interview, saying, \u201cI call a lot of people.\u201d \u201cI have called him, yes, in the past,\u201d Brady said. \u201cSometimes he calls me. Sometimes I call him. But, again, that\u2019s been someone I\u2019ve known. I always try to keep it in context because for 16 years you know someone before maybe he was in the position that he was in. He\u2019s been very supportive of me for a long time. It\u2019s just a friendship. I have a lot of friends. I call a lot of people.\u201d A lot of people still watch the NFL, but viewership is down. And while various factors could be in play, thousands of Americans from the left and the right have expressed that they stopped watching to make a statement about the debate on race and patriotism in America, which was intensified and elevated by the President\u2019s unrelenting war with the NFL.

            "article_content": "If the 2020 election were held today, President Donald Trump would lose, convincingly, to three of the most-mentioned potential 2020 Democrats, according to a new CNN/SSRS poll. While 2020 polling in 2018 is of relatively limited value, a deeper dive into potential Trump head-to-head matchups with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, former Vice President Joe Biden and talk show host Oprah Winfrey reveals a major problem for Trump as he seeks to build a winning coalition in 2020: Women \u2013 across virtually every age, education and racial range \u2013 have moved against him in major numbers. Biden holds an eye-popping 36-point edge over Trump among women, while Sanders leads Trump by 30 and Oprah bests him by 29. That\u2019s a very different result than in the 2016 election, when Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 13 points among women, according to exit polling. Orders of magnitude different. There are a handful of other numbers in the poll \u2013 detailing Trump\u2019s performance with various female subgroups \u2013 that are even more eye-popping. What these numbers suggest is that Trump\u2019s problem with female voters during the 2016 campaign has gotten considerably worse since he has been in office. And that is a huge issue that Trump must find a way to resolve \u2013 or, at least, mitigate \u2013 if he wants to have any chance of winning a second term in 2020. Women made up 53% of the electorate in 2016 and have cast a majority of the votes in every presidential election since 1984. The largest margin among women in a modern presidential election was Bill Clinton\u2019s 16-point win in his swamping of Bob Dole in 1996. Barack Obama won women by 13 points in 2008 and 11 points in 2012 \u2013 roughly equivalent to the 13-point margin for Clinton in 2016. The point here is simple: If Trump loses women by double digits, it\u2019s very hard to make the math add up for him.",

Bush's favorable rating has grown from 33% to 61% since he left office Bush holds a majority favorable rating among every demographic group but liberals He spoke out against Trump about bigotry and white supremacy in 2017 George W. Bush has turned his unpopularity upside down. Six in 10 Americans, 61%, say they now have a favorable view of the 43rd President of the United States in the latest CNN poll conducted by SSRS, nearly double the 33% who gave him a favorable mark when he left the White House in January 2009. His mark is lower than Barack Obama\u2019s 66% favorable rating in the same poll, but significantly higher than the 40% favorable rating for President Donald Trump. Most of Bush\u2019s climb back to popularity came from Democrats and independents. His favorability mark among Democrats has soared from only 11% in February 2009 to a majority 54% now. In fact, Bush holds a majority favorable rating among every demographic group but liberals \u2013 including strong Democratic groups like nonwhites and people under 35 years old. When it comes to Republicans, his marks are virtually the same as they were immediately after he left office. His favorability climbed from 76% among Republicans a month after he left office to 88% in a 2015 poll from CNN/ORC \u2013 but it\u2019s fallen back down to 76% in the Trump era. Despite the climb overall, Republican disapproval of the former president has tripled from 7% to 21% since 2015. It\u2019s not uncommon for a president\u2019s favorability numbers to improve after leaving office. Bill Clinton\u2019s favorability climbed from 51% when he left office to 64% in a 2015 poll, though his favorable sank lower \u2013 to 47% \u2013 in October 2016 when his wife, Hillary Clinton, was pursuing her own White House bid. Obama\u2019s favorability has climbed from 59% shortly after Election Day to 66% now. Bush has spoken out against the sitting GOP President a few times over the course of Trump\u2019s presidency so far. \u201cOur identity as a nation, unlike other nations, is not determined by geography or ethnicity, by soil or blood. \u2026 This means that people from every race, religion, ethnicity can be full and equally American,\u201d Bush said at an October event. \u201cIt means that bigotry and white supremacy, in any form, is blasphemy against the American creed,\u201d he continued, adding that \u201cbigotry seems emboldened.\u201d Bush also put out a joint statement with his father, former President George H.W. Bush, in the wake of white supremacist rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, saying \u201cAmerica must always reject racial bigotry, anti-Semitism, and hatred in all forms,\u201d after Trump said there was blame on \u201cboth sides\u201d for the violence in August.

They were worried that voters didn\u2019t understand their tax reform law or give the GOP credit for a strong economy. And that was before President Donald Trump ignited yet another controversy that Republicans lawmakers and strategists say will worsen both problems. After telling lawmakers at a White House meeting last week that he wanted immigrants from largely white Norway \u2013 not Africa or Haiti \u2013 Trump once again faces charges of racism from Republican and Democratic lawmakers, this time over Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend.

After a response to white supremacists\u2019 rally last year in Charlottesville, Virginia, they said, it\u2019s too late. More worrying for the GOP now is that Trump\u2019s remarks hijacked several days\u2019 worth of opportunities to tell an economic story the party views as its central argument in this year\u2019s midterms: The stock market is booming. Newly passed tax cuts are just about to take effect. And businesses have responded to the tax measure by announcing bonus checks. \u201cFrom an outcome basis, the President has a lot to take credit for,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican who chaired the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm. \u201cBut to do that, you have to stay on message.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like this tax bill: Nobody\u2019s read the damn thing. Most people benefit from it, yet they don\u2019t like it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? Because of who\u2019s saying what, in the messaging.\u201d \u201cThere are just so many distractions away from the positive stories this administration could be talking about. And that\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault \u2013 that\u2019s the president\u2019s fault,\u201d said Republican strategist Alex Conant, a veteran of Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. With 10 months before the midterms, there\u2019s ample time for Republicans \u2013 particularly well-funded candidates \u2013 to sell voters on a strong economy and distance themselves from Trump. But 2017\u2019s elections offered worrying signs for the GOP. Strong turnout from minority voters \u2013 a key element of the Democratic base \u2013 played a crucial role in the party\u2019s wins in the Virginia governor\u2019s race and the Alabama US Senate special election in December. If that trend extends into 2018, it would damage the GOP in states with Latino-heavy electorates, like Arizona and Nevada, where two Republican-held Senate seats are up for grabs, and California, where Democrats are targeting seven GOP-held House seats. In generic Democrat vs. Republican match-ups, Quinnipiac University found in a poll released last week that voters favor Democrats by a 17-point margin. Other pollsters have found a similarly massive gap \u2013 which is tied in part to Trump\u2019s approval rating. Headlines over his characterization of largely black countries won\u2019t help reverse those figures, Republicans said. \u201cThe President\u2019s comments are problematic because they\u2019re unsympathetic and reinforces what 65% of the country already believes about him,\u201d said Reed Galen, a Republican strategist who was the deputy campaign manager of Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential bid. \u201cThat it happened over the course of MLK weekend is important because it pulls in all of the cumulative statements and acts,\u201d Galen said, \u201csince his campaign began two and a half years ago.\u201d Davis said the Virginia elections, which wiped out 15 Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates, showed that \u201cthere is no escaping\u201d Trump. \u201cThey were messengers,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople wanted to send a message to Trump.\u201d",

            "article_content": "He trampled the unifying conventions of the inaugural address by decrying \"American carnage\" Conventional measures fail to encapsulate the utterly abnormal presidency that is unfolding It will be impossible to adequately explain in decades to come just what it was like to be alive in the exhausting first year of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. From the moment he trampled the unifying conventions of the inaugural address by decrying \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d Trump shattered political normality, tearing at racial and societal divides, the limits and decorum of his office, even raising doubts about his fidelity to the nation\u2019s founding values. Trump is like a raging storm that never blows itself out, as his early morning Twitter rants injected into the nation\u2019s central nervous system trigger outrages that obliterate traditional political debate and make days feel like weeks, weeks feel like months and months feel like years. Inaugural address: Trump's full speech The normal tools for judging a presidency \u2013 legislation passed, America\u2019s relative global power, the health of the economy, the President\u2019s approval rating and the security and prosperity of the populace \u2013 can be used to assess Trump. But such conventional measures fail to encapsulate the utterly abnormal presidency that is unfolding or the way Trump, who craves attention and gets it by fomenting chaos, has barged his way into every corner of national life. On Sunday, in the wake of his reported comments about \u201cshithole\u201d African nations, he told reporters \u201cI am not a racist.\u201d The declaration itself speaks to how unusual his unfolding presidency is. Everyone, from the sidelines of a kid\u2019s soccer game in the suburbs to subway passengers in the cities to the hotbeds of Trump country, has an opinion on the President. He\u2019s impossible to ignore and impossible to escape. And that is exactly the way he likes it. For Trump, the presidency seems as much about orchestrating strife in the center of a whirlwind as he tilts at national taboos as it is the steady accumulation of political and global victories. Yet, on its own terms, Trump\u2019s presidency has also delivered. His Cabinet members are implementing a hardline conservative agenda that is quietly reshaping America. His judicial appointments will remake jurisprudence for a generation to come. His tax law and it\u2019s 14-percentage-point corporate tax rate cut could, according to the administration, open a gusher of cash and create jobs and repair the industrial fabric of Midwestern states that made Trump president. But while he\u2019s doggedly carried out some of his most controversial campaign promises, Trump\u2019s wins have been overshadowed by behavior that electrifies his supporters but causes offense to many others. It\u2019s a paradox that the economy is roaring, the stock market is soaring, unemployment is at 17-year lows and ISIS is all but defeated, yet the President\u2019s approval ratings are the lowest of any new commander in chief. Trump has repeatedly expressed his frustration over that disconnect. Trump's approval rating at 32% \u201cI don\u2019t think any administration has ever done \u2026 what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019ve accomplished in its first year,\u201d Trump told his Cabinet last week. \u201cThe achievements for our country, our people, and for our standing in the world have been very monumental.\u201d In one sense, Trump is right: No administration has done what his has done. But his remarks were typically Trumpian, overstating his achievements and showing a tendency to create his own reality in a presidency that has posed unprecedented challenges to truth and fact. Trump will have been president for just one year on Saturday. But he has racked up a record of blowups, feuds and stunning episodes that would make a full two-term administration look full, and scarred by scandal and acrimony. There was the bizarre dispute over the size of his inaugural crowds, the departure of national security adviser Michael Flynn, the travel ban, the claim that he was wiretapped by the Obama administration, the airstrike on Syria and the installation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch. The crazy cascade of events continued with his firing of FBI Director James Comey, the arrival of special counsel Robert Mueller, the mushrooming probe of the Trump campaign\u2019s possible role in Russia election meddling, Trump\u2019s claim he saw MSNBC anchor Mika Brzezinski bleeding from cosmetic surgery, the botched repeal of Obamacare, his equivocation over neo-Nazi marchers, West Wing chaos \u2026 and that time the President looked directly into the sun during the eclipse. There was the once-in-a-generation tax cut, the attacks on socially conscious NFL players, the self-combustion of former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon, the bizarre public inquest into whether the President of the United States was fit for office following revelations from Michael Wolff\u2019s stunning book and his incendiary nuclear taunting of \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d Kim Jong Un. That\u2019s not even close to a comprehensive list. \u201cEvery day, there is another thing. This like reality TV, right? It\u2019s not healthy for our country or the world,\u201d Ohio\u2019s Republican Gov. John Kasich told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Friday. If there is one underlying theme of Trump\u2019s first year, it is his willingness \u2013 whether in his disregard for ethics norms relating to his business empire or his belief that he has the \u201cabsolute right\u201d to do what he wants with the Justice Department \u2013 to flout every expectation and constraint of his office. It\u2019s a trend evident in his assault on institutions that act as checks on his power, like the intelligence agencies, the judiciary and the press, that will bear the scars after he has left the Oval Office. \u201cDonald Trump has no regard for rules, he has thumbed his nose at rules his entire life,\u201d said David Cay Johnston, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist who has known Trump for 30 years and has a new book out on Trump\u2019s presidency coming on Tuesday. \u201cHe is a dictator in waiting, he talks as a dictator and he will do whatever he wants,\u201d said Johnston, whose book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than You Think: What the Trump Administration is Doing to America\u201d concludes that Trump is unique in being the only US president not to pursue policies in the national interest. \u201cThe Trump presidency is about Trump. Period. Full stop,\u201d Johnston writes. If that is true, the political system itself is facing an unprecedented challenge. Indeed, the President\u2019s recent assault on the credibility of the FBI and the Justice Department, interference being run by Capitol Hill Republicans on the Russia probe, combined with attacks on Mueller by pro-Trump media outlets raise profound questions about the system of checks and balances. Some of the times Trump has called Russia probe a 'witch hunt' At this point, it appears far from certain that should the special counsel find that Trump obstructed justice or colluded with Russia in the election, the GOP-led House and Senate would move against him and consider whether he is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors. That fact alone means the 2018 midterm election \u2013 in which Democrats are targeting big wins \u2013 could end up being effectively an impeachment referendum. Trump has vehemently and repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. An underrated aspect of the President\u2019s year is the way he has cowed the Republican Party itself. He appears to have destroyed the insurgent platform of Bannon after his former political adviser cooperated extensively with Wolff. Republican senators, such as Bob Corker and Jeff Flake who criticized him, have only done so as they choose to end their political careers. The ire of Trump primary voters keeps many other critics quiet. And Paul Ryan\u2019s praise for Trump\u2019s \u201cexquisite\u201d leadership after the tax law passed last year signals that the House speaker will stay aboard the Trump train as long as his long-wished for conservative program is signed into law. And while his agency chiefs are implementing that program, critics argue that many \u2013 Education Secretary Betsy DeVos or EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt for instance \u2013 are either unqualified or are embarked on an ideological project to dismantle government itself. Trump\u2019s authoritarian reflexes meanwhile have been revealed in his demands for his political enemies, including Hillary Clinton to face prosecution and his call just last week for libel laws to be tightened to punish his media critics. It is not only domestic political structures that are being put under duress by this most abnormal presidency. Trump has initiated a fundamental shift in the nation\u2019s global role in the past year. The President\u2019s national security adviser HR McMaster declared last month that under Trump, America had reclaimed its \u201cstrategic confidence.\u201d The administration has unveiled a national security strategy aimed at \u201crevisionist powers,\u201d such as China and Russia, that targets \u201crogue\u201d regimes, such as Iran and North Korea and jihadist groups. Yet Trump\u2019s actions often appear to run counter to that strategy as he idolizes Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and his foreign policy choices seem dictated not by global strategy but the desires of his political base. Again, there have been clear successes. His administration intensified and delivered on the Obama administration\u2019s plans to defeat ISIS in Syria and imposed the most stringent ever sanctions against North Korea. But as at home, Trump\u2019s own actions, wild tweets and \u201cAmerica First\u201d instincts have overshadowed his achievements. He\u2019s made the US, for so long a bulwark of global stability, into an agent of disruption and unpredictability. His rhetoric on race and religion threatens to dim the power of America\u2019s example. Many nations, China included, see moves like pulling out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, quitting the Paris climate accord and cutting foreign aid as a sign of a US retreat, even if US military might remains unchallenged. A fateful question when Trump took office after a riotous outsider campaign was whether the presidency would change him or he would change the presidency. It\u2019s now clear that the responsibilities and power that sobered most of the 43 individual men who held the job before him have not transformed Trump. His unrestrained approach is the reason people who love him support him even more intensely one year in, but it\u2019s also why a majority of the nation fears he\u2019s disastrously unsuited to the job and why his immediate predecessors in the President\u2019s club, in a highly unusual move, have repudiated him. Trump remains uncouth, unrestrained and unrepentant. That\u2019s why his second year is likely to be even more draining and disruptive than his first.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court announced Friday that it plans to hear a significant voting rights case, agreeing to review a lower court opinion that invalidated congressional and statehouse maps in Texas. The order adds another case touching on voting disputes to the court\u2019s docket at a time when the justices are already considering cases concerning partisan gerrymandering and the purge of voter rolls in Ohio. The justices have already indicated they might be split down ideological lines in the case because last fall they voted 5-4 to freeze the lower court opinion until they decided whether to take up the case. Supreme Court struggles with Ohio voter roll case Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented from that order. As things stand, the Supreme Court\u2019s order means that the current maps will probably be used in the 2018 election, but no final determination has been made. The case highlights a dispute that has been embroiled in the courts for almost a decade. After the last census, voting rights groups such as the Southern Coalition for Social Justice and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund challenged maps drawn in 2011 by the republican led legislature. A court struck down the maps finding that they were enacted with a discriminatory purpose and ordered new interim maps to be drawn. The legislation subsequently enacted the new maps \u2013 called Plan C235 \u2013 into law while  the litigation continued. Panel formed to review standards of conduct for court employees After a trial in 2017, the district Court then invalidated two districts of Plan C235 holding that one was enacted with discriminatory intent and the other contained was an impermissible racial gerrymander. The Court noted that \u201cspecific portions\u201d of the 2011 plans that were found to be discriminatory or unconstitutional \u201ccontinue unchanged.\u201d In a similar case the court also invalidated eight state legislative districts. \u201cThe discriminatory taint was not removed by the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the court\u2019s interim plans, because the Legislature engaged in no deliberative process to remove any such taint, and in fact intended any such taint to be maintained but be safe from remedy,\u201d wrote United States District Judge Xavier Rodriguez of the Western District of Texas. Lawyers for Texas criticized the lower court opinion arguing that the maps should stand, particularly since they were adopted with the guidance of the district court. Judge blocks Trump administration plan to roll back DACA \u201cFive years and three election cycles after ordering Texas to use the map known as Plan C235, that very same court has now held that the Legislature engaged in intentional discrimination and racial gerrymandering when it enacted legislation adopting Plan C235 as its own,\u201d Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton argued in court papers. He said that Plan C235 that has been in place for half a decade \u201ccan hardly now be so offensive to the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution that it must be wiped from the books immediately, before the State can even pursue a direct appeal.\u201d The court did not say when it will hear the case.",

            "article_content": "Ginsburg hired law clerks for the next two terms, an indication she does not plan to retire The liberal was expected to leave had Hillary Clinton been elected Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg marks her 25th anniversary on the Supreme Court this year, and the cultural icon known as the \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d recently signaled that she intends to stay at least through 2020 by hiring law clerks for at least two more terms. Get fit like Ruth Bader Ginsburg Ginsburg, who turns 85 in March, would have to stay another decade to near the record of William O. Douglas, who served the longest at 36 years. But Ginsburg has already distinguished herself among justices for an intriguing second act, the product of pop culture passion. If Democrat Hillary Clinton had won the presidency in 2016, liberal Ginsburg would likely have announced her retirement by this spring. Instead the justice who made her name as a women\u2019s rights lawyer in the 1970s apparently is not counting on leaving the stage any time soon. The law clerk news, reported by Above the Law, triggered a tweet storm through the weekend, some of which included links to a classic 2016 Saturday Night Live \u201cGins-burn\u201d parody featuring comedian Kate McKinnon as the black-robed Ginsburg. The Supreme Court public information office confirmed the hiring to CNN. In partisan times, chief justice worries about the court's image Some comments on Twitter pitted Ginsburg against President Donald Trump, who in 2016 tweeted that \u201cHer mind is shot \u2013 resign!\u201d after she publicly criticized him and deemed him a \u201cfaker.\u201d Trump has also said that he expects Ginsburg to leave the court while he is president and able to replace her with a new justice. Liberal Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe tweeted: \u201cGreat news: Justice Ginsburg has hired a full slate of law clerks through 2020. Take that, \u2018stable genius\u2019 Donald.\u201d Ginsburg\u2019s intention to remain on the bench at least through 2020 is not unexpected. Ginsburg has made clear in interviews that she would stay if her health holds. She has survived two bouts with cancer, colorectal in 1999 and pancreatic in 2009, and says she gets regular check-ups. She exercises daily and lifts weights. When asked in October about possible retirement, she said, \u201cMy answer is as long as I can do the job full steam, I will do it.\u201d Since her appointment in 1993, Ginsburg has had two distinct chapters. She joined as the second woman justice (after Sandra Day O\u2019Connor) and continued her emphasis on women\u2019s rights, penning the 1996 opinion that forced the state-run Virginia Military Institute to admit women, and established a generally liberal record. But Ginsburg was not among the most visible justices in her earlier years. That began to change when O\u2019Connor retired in 2006. In February 2009, for example, while undergoing cancer treatment, Ginsburg joined her brethren at an evening joint session of Congress because she wanted the national audience to see that the justices were not only men. In 2010, when Justice John Paul Stevens retired, Ginsburg became the most senior liberal justice and a robust voice for the left. Her 2013 dissent in a case invalidating a major portion of the Voting Rights Act, Shelby County v. Holder, inspired the Notorious RBG meme. Shana Knizhnik, then a New York University law student, adapted it from rapper The Notorious B.I.G. as she highlighted Ginsburg\u2019s opinion about the need for continuing vigilance on voting rights, particularly in places with a history of racial discrimination. Fearing his retirement, liberals hope Anthony Kennedy can help resist the conservative tide The Brooklyn-born justice has gone along with the attention, which comes especially from young women, in good humor and continued her jabs, if more subtly, at Trump. The day after the November 2016 election, she wore over her black robe the jabot she reserves for days in which she issues a dissenting opinion. While fans and critics keep an eye on her health, Ginsburg has demonstrated that she has another justice in mind when she thinks about the future of the nine-member bench. Asked last year who she would like to see eat more kale, she answered, \u201cJustice Kennedy,\u201d referring to centrist conservative Anthony Kennedy, whose vote the four liberals need to prevail and who is 81.

            "article_content": "As 2018 kicks off, we'll start our weekly roundup with a quick survey of the field The rest of the field has to strategize around Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: The list of Democratic lawmakers, governors and public figures considering 2020 presidential runs into the 30s \u2014 and seems to grow every week. As 2018 kicks off, we\u2019ll start our weekly roundup with a quick survey of the field as it looks currently, based on which 2020 prospects are dominating headlines, making visits to early-voting states and more: Discussion of 2020 has to start with the three potential candidates around whom the rest of the field has to strategize: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is still traveling the country like a candidate and would start with a much stronger early-state organization than he had in 2016; former Vice President Joe Biden, who\u2019s universally known and is seen as authentic, a valuable commodity in this era; and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is immensely popular with the progressive base and has been carefully maneuvering to address her potential weaknesses. Then there\u2019s an almost-as-prolific trio of senators who have emerged as powerful foils to the Trump administration: New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, whose role in ousting Democratic Sen. Al Franken over sexual misconduct allegations positioned her to lead the same charge against President Donald Trump; California Sen. Kamala Harris, who emerged as a star in her first year in office and, along with Warren and two other Democrats, just introduced a major Wall Street oversight bill; and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who recently made a push for marijuana legalization as part of his broader racial justice effort. The senators: Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has visited Iowa. So has Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, who progressive groups credit as being an influential behind-the-scenes organizer. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy says he\u2019s not running, but a presidential campaign would elevate his pro-gun control message. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown has a tough re-election in front of him this year, but his populist brand could work well against Trump. And Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine says he won\u2019t run, but if Terry McAuliffe doesn\u2019t, could that change? Moulton, Kennedy offer Democrats two paths for the future The House members: Maryland Rep. John Delaney is already in, and spends his weekends alternating between Iowa and New Hampshire trips. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio has been in Iowa and South Carolina. Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton also made an Iowa trip and has been a prolific recruiter and fundraiser this election cycle. California Rep. Adam Schiff has a high-profile role in the Russia probe and was recently a keynote speaker at a South Carolina Democratic event. California\u2019s Eric Swalwell and Hawaii\u2019s Tulsi Gabbard have both made recent Iowa trips, while Illinois Rep. Luis Guti\u00e9rrez is retiring but could be eyeing a 2020 bid. The governors: This list has to start with outgoing Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who is leaving office after massive Democratic victories in the campaign to replace him, and has showed more interest in the fate of the Democratic National Committee than other party leaders, recently hosting a year-end fundraiser for the party. Also on the list: two Westerners, Montana\u2019s Steve Bullock and Colorado\u2019s John Hickenlooper, as well as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Perhaps the most interesting prospect is a former Massachusetts governor: Deval Patrick, who is beloved in Barack Obama world but spent the last few years working for Bain Capital. Also worth watching is California Gov. Jerry Brown. At 79, he\u2019s older than virtually all presidential candidates \u2014 but so are Sanders and Biden. Brown has also run for the job before, and the surest indicator that a politician might run for president is having run for president before. The mayors: New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu recently visited South Carolina and is a well-liked figure in Democratic circles across the country. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was just in Iowa. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has publicly flirted with a 2020 run for months. And South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been a hot commodity and made a recent Iowa trip after his failed bid for Democratic National Committee chairman a year ago. The formers: No longer in public office themselves, at least three Democrats nonetheless could be waiting in the wings. Former Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro is working on a book and teaching college classes in Texas right now. And former Missouri secretary of state and Senate candidate Jason Kander has traveled the country (including frequent trips to Iowa and New Hampshire) as part of his focus on voting rights. Former Attorney General Eric Holder, meanwhile, is leading the Democratic redistricting effort. The celebrities: Yes, Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson says he might run for president. But Democrats are taking several other prospects more seriously \u2014 particularly Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban talks often about the chance he might run (though he might not run as a Democrat), while Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s recent cross-country travels have kicked up speculation about his future. Tom Steyer is a player, too \u2014 keep reading for more on him. STEYER\u2019S \u2018MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT\u2019: Billionaire Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer \u2014 who\u2019s spent $20 million on ads calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2014 plans what a press release billed as a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d about \u201chis political future and plans for 2018\u201d Monday morning in Washington. Steyer has long been seen as having political ambition, and he\u2019s considered running for California governor or the Senate this year or president in 2020. For what it\u2019s worth: Campaigns for California offices generally don\u2019t launch from DC. SANDERS REUNION IN MICHIGAN: A group of young, digital-savvy organizers who helped turn Sen. Bernie Sanders into an online sensation \u2014 then turned that popularity into campaign cash, packed rallies and votes \u2014 are joining forces again, in Michigan, where Sanders scored his most stunning primary victory. The candidate this time is Abdul El-Sayed, a 33-year-old Rhodes scholar turned doctor and public health expert vying to become the nation\u2019s first Muslim governor. He\u2019s hired former Sanders digital organizing director Claire Sandberg as his deputy campaign manager and retained Middle Seat Digital, the firm founded by Sanders digital director Kenneth Pennington and social media lead Hector Sigala. Winnie Wong, co-founder of People for Bernie, the online group that popularized the #feelthebern hashtag, has come on as a consultant to the growing campaign. Victory for El-Sayed, who has seven months to catch up to front-runner Gretchen Whitmer, would give added juice to Sanders\u2019 2020 prospects and confirm the strength of his potential campaign-in-waiting. 2020 PROSPECTS HIT SESSIONS ON MARIJUANA: Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 move to reverse Obama-era rules that left states that had legalized pot alone drew swift rebukes from Democratic 2020 prospects. \u201cThis is a destructive decision and a huge step backwards,\u201d said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley. \u201cWhatever happened to Attorney General Sessions\u2019 belief in states\u2019 rights?\u201d California Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted: \u201cInstead of going after drug cartels, and violent crime, and major traffickers, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is going after recreational marijuana users. That\u2019s not being smart on crime.\u201d One notable line from New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s response: \u201cVeterans should be able to come home from combat and use the medicine they need without having to fear they will be prosecuted.\u201d RYAN COY ABOUT 2020: One we missed late last year: MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews asked Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan directly if he\u2019s running for president in 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I am,\u201d Ryan responded. DE BLASIO\u2019S EVOLVING ALLIANCES: From the department of \u201cmy, how much things have changed,\u201d New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio \u2014 who slipped in a trip to Iowa before New Year\u2019s \u2014 was sworn in for his second term on January 1 by Bernie Sanders. Former President Bill Clinton did the same job at his first inauguration, in 2014. \u201cI have immense respect for what (Sanders) has done,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cHe\u2019s single-handedly changed discussion in this country. No one has shined the light on the question of income inequality more than Bernie Sanders, and he\u2019s changed the way that politics will be approached in this country going forward.\u201d California Sen. Kamala Harris will be this year\u2019s grand marshal of the annual Kingdom Day Parade, the massive Los Angeles parade held on Martin Luther King Jr. Day. \u2026 South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg announced in a Facebook post on December 28 that he and his boyfriend, Chasten Glezman, are engaged. \u2026 Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren had to postpone a town hall in Quincy that was set for Friday night \u2014 for good reason: With a winter storm hitting the area, the high school that was set to host it is being used as an emergency shelter.

Ralph Eubanks is the author of \u201cEver is a Long Time: A Journey Into Mississippi\u2019s Dark Past,\u201d and is a visiting professor of English and Southern Studies at the University of Mississippi. He supported Mike Espy for Senate. He is currently at work on a book on Mississippi\u2019s literary landscape. The views expressed here are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. Mississippi is not a place with a monolithic culture, but one with a myriad of subcultures stitched together in a patchwork of beautiful imperfection. The black-white binary is only one lens through which to view the state; the essence of Mississippi is far more complicated. You can\u2019t visit this state and not encounter ethnic and cultural diversity, whether it is Middle Easterners, Asians, and Latinos in the Delta, a thriving gay and lesbian bookstore in the Hill Country hamlet of Water Valley, or the mingling of bohemian and traditional communities in its college towns. While it is difficult, both literally and figuratively, to escape symbols memorializing the state\u2019s mythologized Civil War past \u2013 whether cast in stone or as part of the state flag \u2013 there is a sizable number of Mississippians who acknowledge our complicated history yet are looking toward a new future. In a state where you cannot talk about history or politics without talking about race, our politicians persist in deftly moving around the issue, sometimes clumsily and other times with balletic precision. The recent Senate campaign, which ended Tuesday night in Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s victory over Mike Espy, was no exception, and the movements to that delicate dance around race were at center stage. This election pitted substantive public policy issues against the politics of fear and the culture wars, and even a broad and inclusive \u2013 and politically moderate \u2013 platform could not push Espy\u2019s campaign to a victory. Tuesday night, Mississippi had the opportunity to show the country that it had become a state that has shaken off its image as a closed society. In the end, it was Mississippi\u2019s past that won the election rather than its future. Hyde-Smith is exactly who the Daughters of the Confederacy wanted her to be Whether Mississippi can move forward depends not only on its politicians, but also on its voters and what they do now. Mississippians, regardless of party or race, must also come to terms with the state\u2019s history rather than fearing it. More important, they must also realize Mississippi\u2019s dark past is one in which we all hold ownership, not just those who were affected by that past. The Senate runoff, with its racially tinged and distasteful comments from Cindy Hyde-Smith about public hangings and voter suppression, and President Trump asking a crowd in Tupelo \u201cHow does he (Espy) fit in in Mississippi?\u201d are echoes from another era, one that 40 years ago pushed many of my generation to leave. Today, Mississippi remains a state that is losing its educated young people, and this election might be the signal for many to pack their bags. As Mississippi Today reported this past May, in the six years from 2010 to 2016, the state lost 35,013 people, and it is the only state in the nation losing so many people so fast. What the last two weeks of the Espy and Hyde-Smith campaign demonstrated is that Mississippi cannot let go of a mythic vision of itself; it ignores the hard truths about its past, particularly when it comes to race. Part of the state\u2019s current mythology is that all of our racial transgressions were resolved during the Civil Rights movement, and that to bring up the ways the legacy of that past manifests itself in the present is impolite and unseemly. Those who dare to talk about race are immediately accused of playing the race card, rather than simply acknowledging that Mississippi has only been functioning as a multiracial society for the past 50 years and still has much work to do. No, Cindy Hyde-Smith, hanging is no joke Rather than confronting the public hanging comment head-on at a press conference, Gov. Phil Bryant chose to push the issue aside by implying that black women are participating in \u201cthe genocide of 20 million African-American children\u201d through legal abortions, stoking the politics of fear among one-issue voters rather than confronting the issue at hand. Later, when Espy responded to Hyde-Smith\u2019s long-needed apology by saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in your heart, but we all know what came out of your mouth,\u201d many wished he had probed deeper \u2013 perhaps reminding Hyde Smith that if racism is America\u2019s original sin, lynching represents its unresolved legacy and is nothing to joke about. To her comments about voter repression, Espy could have reminded Hyde-Smith that the standard devices for accomplishing the disenfranchisement of voters on a racial basis were invented in Mississippi and even memorialized in the state\u2019s 1890 Constitution. Yet the issue of voter suppression never even became part of the public debate. Perhaps the two candidates could have even had a discussion about the network of segregated white academies that educate many of this state\u2019s white students and educated many of our legislators. As reporting from the Jackson Free Press revealed during the campaign, Hyde-Smith attended one of those schools. The two candidates could have talked about how, for more than a decade after integration was enshrined in federal law, Mississippi used a network of other laws thicker than a field of kudzu to ensure that white and black children would be kept separate. And when those laws failed their court challenges, private academies like the one Hyde-Smith attended popped up from the Piney Woods in the south and all through the Delta faster than suburban tract houses after World War II. Civil War ghosts haunt the Mississippi runoff vote And of course, no one talked about the photograph from Hyde-Smith\u2019s 1975 yearbook of a cheerleading squad posed with a Confederate flag. As Susan Sontag writes in \u201cOn Photography,\u201d photographs provide evidence. Moreover, photographs authenticate the existence of a place or time and show what has been, since all photographs expose a past reality. The past reality that the photograph of the cheerleading squad reveals is how all-white academies embraced the symbols segregationists used to promote white supremacy. Cindy Hyde-Smith may not be a white supremacist, but the photograph provides evidence that the symbols of white supremacy were undeniably part of her cultural formation and perhaps even shaped her politics. Yet the lessons to be learned from this Mississippi Senate race do not lie in the gaffes and missteps of one candidate. This campaign was a missed opportunity for the entire state for racial dialogue. What the Hyde-Smith-Espy run-off reveals is that Mississippi\u2019s politicians need to confront our state\u2019s past rather than denying or ignoring its existence. The great irony of all of this is that frank discussion about race and history seems impossible to have in a state with a civil rights museum that includes exhibitions supported by strong historical evidence, much of it from the archives of the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a state-run agency founded in 1956 to preserve segregation.  Instead, the prevailing point of view is that the way to overcome our racial divide is to simply look beyond it and even to bury it. As this campaign reveals, that approach is not working and is continuing to divide the citizens of this state. Mississippi is no longer just black and white, and the lessons of its history belong to anyone who chooses to live here. We may not share the same politics or background, but we do have a shared history. And only when we come to understand and embrace that history can Mississippi begin to bridge its political and racial divides.",

Every Southerner knows the truth of William Faulkner\u2019s words: \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past.\u201d History hangs over Southern politics with a heaviness less known in the North.  While it is a lazy northern stereotype to dismiss the South as irredeemably racist, the legacy of slavery, the Civil War and segregation plays a disproportionate role in Southern politics. Just take a look at the high-stakes Senate runoff occurring Tuesday and a far less noticed but almost equally impactful judicial nomination to fill a lifetime federal court seat in North Carolina. Let\u2019s start with the biggest federal race left in the nation, the Mississippi senate runoff between incumbent Republican senator Cindy Hyde-Smith and former Democratic congressman and Clinton agriculture secretary Mike Espy.  First, a reality check: Mississippi hasn\u2019t sent a Democrat to the US Senate since the 1980s. Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton here by an almost 18-point margin in 2016. But after Doug Jones shocked the world with his Senate win over Roy Moore in Alabama all things seem possible, if not likely. CNN\u2019s Harry Enten estimates that Espy will need to pull more than 23% of the white vote and see record African-American turnout to pull out a win. Hyde-Smith is exactly who the Daughters of the Confederacy wanted her to be Given that Espy would be the first African-American senator from the state since Reconstruction, the second half of that requirement does not seem like mission impossible.  But the need for a historically large chunk of the white vote reveals the ghost of the Civil War that huddles in the wings of the Senate race. And Senator Hyde-Smith keeps bringing the subject back by her words and actions. The first incident in this primary was in the form of an odd joke that doesn\u2019t travel for good reason: the senator made a comment about be willing to take a front row seat at a \u201cpublic hanging\u201d if one of her prominent supporters invited her. Lynching humor isn\u2019t really a thing for obvious reasons and the fact that this phrase slipped off her tongue speaks to the way the darkest legacies of the South can endure in phrases that white folks say without thinking. More culpable to my mind was the social media post the senator made after visiting the home of the traitorous Confederate President Jefferson Davis, wearing a confederate cap and calling it \u201cMississippi history at its best.\u201d This is a good example of the \u201cheritage not hate\u201d argument you often hear in the South \u2013 but the truth is that it can be both. This was not just a moment of historic enthusiasm on Hyde-Smith\u2019s part. CNN\u2019s K-File found that she sponsored a resolution to honor the last living daughter of a Confederate soldier in what she called \u201cthe War Between the States,\u201d while the Washington Post found she\u2019d sponsored a resolution to re-name a road the \u201cJefferson Davis Memorial Highway.\u201d Why the Mississippi vote is a key test for America This is perhaps a reflection of the culture Hyde-Smith grew up in: the Jackson Free Press found she\u2019d attended a so-called \u201csegregation academy\u201d in the 1970s \u2013 a private all-white school established as part of so called \u201cmassive resistance\u201d to desegregation championed by white citizens councils at the time. All of this is just more evidence of why it\u2019s important to learn our history and use it to impose perspective on our political judgments today. That\u2019s also why debates over judicial nominations can matter beyond simple questions of filling a vacancy. You probably haven\u2019t heard the name Thomas Farr, but he\u2019s a North Carolina lawyer who\u2019s been nominated to fill the longest open court seat in our country. So why is this controversial? Farr cut his teeth working on the campaign of North Carolina\u2019s notorious Jesse Helms \u2013 a conservative who crusaded against civil rights legislation. More recently he served as a lawyer representing North Carolina\u2019s attempts to roll back voting rights through the use of Voter ID (which the Richmond-based 4th Circuit said impacted African-American voters with \u201calmost surgical precision.\u201d) Perhaps most troubling, Farr represented the North Carolina state legislature in putting forward a racial gerrymandered map which had key elements struck down by the US Supreme Court. With the Senate narrowly divided \u2013 and Obama\u2019s African-American nominees for the seat never brought up for a vote \u2013 all eyes will be on South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott to see whether Farr\u2019s record on voting rights represents a serious concern for the Palmetto state\u2019s conservative,  African-American senator. While Tim Scott is the first African-American from a Southern state to serve in the Senate since Reconstruction, it\u2019s worth noting that South Carolina posited a more diverse statewide elected slate when he and then-Gov. Nikki Haley served in office than most liberal northern states. History casts a long shadow and can shape culture in ways that aren\u2019t always apparent to residents of a particular state. But the stereotypes often break down upon closer inspection. The culture of the country doesn\u2019t entirely change when you drive from a red state to a blue state.  In fact, it might amaze some casual political observers to know that Hillary Clinton won the counties where there are big cities in Southern states like North Carolina (Charlotte, Raleigh-Durham, Greensboro), South Carolina (Charleston and Columbia), Tennessee (Nashville and Memphis) and Alabama (Birmingham and Montgomery).   Obviously, Trump won all these states. But it\u2019s evidence that the larger cultural divisions in our country are not red state versus blue state as much as urban versus rural. And according to CNN\u2019s Enten, Democrats gained 5% in their percentage of the vote in urban and suburban areas of the Deep South in the 2018 midterms compared to the 2016 presidential election. None of this means that Mike Espy should be considered a likely victor in Tuesday\u2019s Mississippi runoff.  But the mere fact of a competitive Senate election between an African-American Democrat and a female Republican is a sign of civic progress that defies stereotypes and marks progress toward rebuking some of the ugliest aspects of our shared history.",

All eyes are on Mississippi and its Senate run-off election Tuesday between junior Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith and her Democrat opponent, former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy. There\u2019s a chance that the seat, long a Republican stronghold in the state, will flip, which is why President Donald Trump is scheduled to fly to Mississippi Monday to rally support for Hyde-Smith, the Republican incumbent. Hyde-Smith has done nothing to help her cause since blurting out her now-infamous line about taking a front row seat at a public hanging. It was a \u201cjoke,\u201d she said. The apology she made during her debate with Mike Espy was a non-apology directed at \u201canyone who was offended\u201d by her racist comments. Then, in Starkville, home of Mississippi State University, she was caught speaking of suppressing the votes of \u201cliberal folks\u201d from \u201cthose other schools,\u201d likely a reference to nearby Mississippi University for Women.  For Hyde-Smith, this was just another \u201cjoke.\u201d Since that time, a photo of her holding a rifle and wearing a Confederate cap during her visit to Beauvoir \u2013 formerly known as the \u201cShrine of Jefferson Davis\u201d \u2013 has circulated with the caption \u201cMississippi history at its best!\u201d It was also revealed that in 2007, Hyde-Smith co-sponsored a resolution to recognize the last living \u201cReal Daughter\u201d of a Confederate soldier from Mississippi. Journalists\u2019 focus on the Mississippi senator\u2019s nostalgia for the Confederacy and her effort to honor a woman with ties to the \u201cWar Between the States\u201d is understandable, especially in the wake of the 2017 Charlottesville uprising, which pulled Confederate imagery out of the past and linked it with present-day racist violence. And yet Hyde-Smith\u2019s views are unsurprising to students of Southern history. This is what happens when generations of white Southerners are fed a revisionist Confederate narrative at a young age. Clearly, Sen. Hyde-Smith was not immune. Like many white Southerners, she not only inherited a reverence for the Confederacy, she celebrated it. No, Cindy Hyde-Smith, hanging is no joke More commonly known as the \u201cLost Cause,\u201d this narrative, along with its racist underpinnings, has a long history in the South and especially in Mississippi, due in large part to the influence of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC).  From its founding in 1894 through the early decades of the 20th century, the organization made pro-Confederate education a central part of its mission with children. It was reflected in textbooks, birthday celebrations of Confederate heroes, and the creation of the Children of the Confederacy.  By mid-century, those children were adults. And many of them had become segregationists. During massive resistance to civil rights in the 1950s and 1960s, white supremacists praised UDC members for their efforts to educate children to revere the Confederacy, because it provided them with a blueprint for dealing with desegregation. They followed the Daughters\u2019 example as they sought to eliminate material from school textbooks that denigrated \u201cthe Southern way of life,\u201d and in 1956 the Mississippi House of Representatives passed a bill that required the State Library Commission to purchase books that promoted white supremacy. By the 1970s, Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith\u2019s generation was still being educated along these lines. She was raised on the narrative that cast Confederates as heroes and former slave masters as benevolent to the enslaved. She grew up among white Mississippians who continued to resist desegregation by creating Mississippi\u2019s all-white segregation academies, designed to resist integration.  Hyde-Smith graduated from one of them in 1977. Why the Mississippi vote is a key test for America While the senator cannot be blamed for where her parents sent her to school, she continued the tradition by sending her daughter to one of these so-called \u201cChristian\u201d academies which, during the 2015-2016 school year, had only one African-American student. This is exactly what the early UDC had in mind when it began \u2013 to perpetuate the racial values of the Confederate generation. Rather than accept civil rights, generations of whites, including Hyde-Smith, have engaged in a self-imposed segregation from people of color by sending their children to private schools, while the state has allowed majority-black public schools to wither on the vine. Given all of this, why is anyone shocked by her comments about a \u201cpublic hanging\u201d or the suppression of the votes of \u201cliberal folks\u201d when it\u2019s part of her social and cultural DNA? It is consistent with her education and her state\u2019s history, especially when it comes to African-American political progress. While there has been significant change, and people who work for the greater good of all citizens, the culture of white supremacy has never left Mississippi.  In 2018, there finally appears to be a public pushback against this kind of thinking in the state, which may result in the election of Mississippi\u2019s first African-American senator since Reconstruction. And yet President Trump\u2019s rallies for Hyde-Smith will, in essence, reaffirm white reverence for the former Confederacy and may succeed in boosting her chances of victory. If it does, it will be a failure for Mississippians of all races for generations to come.",

No, I don\u2019t just mean becoming the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. I\u2019m talking something potentially even more remarkable. She\u2019s become the key topic of conversation for Fox News commentators. In fact, President Trump\u2019s favorite network has what I\u2019d like to refer to as \u201cAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez derangement syndrome.\u201d They can\u2019t stop talking everything Ocasio-Cortez, from her choice of footwear to the type of apartment she can afford to the alleged impending doom she presents for America. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's shoes are making history Could it be that a young, brown Latina woman is the new \u201cvillain\u201d Fox News needs to keep viewers tuned in? What makes this even more incredible is that Ocasio-Cortez has not been sworn in to Congress yet. In fact she only really gained national media attention in June, when she won her primary, defeating longtime Democratic Representative Joe Crowley. Look at the way Ocasio-Cortez has triggered Fox News in just the last week alone. On Saturday, in yet another discussion of the rising Democratic star, one Fox News guest described her as \u201c[Fidel] Castro\u2019s granddaughter, Ocasio-Cortez,\u201d claiming her values would bring a dangerous form of politics to America. On Wednesday, Fox News contributor Rachel Campos-Duffy declared that Ocasio-Cortez should be person of the year because she had mainstreamed socialism, paving the way for other Democrats to reveal that they, too, are socialists. Come Thanksgiving Day \u2013 apparently there\u2019s no holiday break for Ocasio-Cortez derangement syndrome on Fox News \u2013 host Charles Payne warned that Ocasio-Cortez was going to destroy everything. Payne told Fox News viewers in between their bites of turkey that \u201cthe Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezes of the world\u201d are \u201clike bulls in a china shop,\u201d adding ominously, \u201cthey just want to create havoc.\u201d She will be the youngest member of Congress Then on Friday night, Fox News took its Ocasio-Cortez fetish to new heights, discussing her shoes in prime time. The segment opened with Fox News host Ed Henry first admitting the network\u2019s obsession with the soon to be member of Congress, stating, \u201cwe talk about her a lot on Fox & Friends Weekend.\u201d And then Henry led a discussion about the worn-out shoes Ocasio-Cortez used on the campaign trail that will soon become part of Cornell University\u2019s new exhibit on women in politics: \u201cWomen Empowered: Fashions from the Front Line.\u201d In that conversation, Fox News contributor Campos-Duffy reiterated her fears of socialism and told viewers that Ocasio-Cortez wants to turn America into Venezuela, where people \u201cdon\u2019t have shoes on their feet because of what socialism has done to their country.\u201d Fox News really needs to find another subject to discuss. In fact, after this segment on Friday, Ocasio-Cortez took to Twitter to respond with the words, \u201cNo, no es amor/ Lo que t\u00fa sientes, se llama obsession.\u201d These lines are lyrics are from the song Obsesi\u00f3n, by Aventura, which translates into English as: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not love, what you feel is called obsession.\u201d 16 reasons to be excited about the midterm Rainbow Wave Ocasio-Cortez is right on the money. Fox News is obsessed with her. And it appears others in the right-wing media have also caught some of the Ocasio-Cortez derangement syndrome, as they also seemingly cover her every comment. So what\u2019s driving all of this? Could it be that Fox News is realizing its longtime bogeywomen, Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi, are losing their luster for their viewers?  (I actually enjoy flipping on Fox News on occasion because on that network it appears that Hillary Clinton is president.) Given that the Democrats won the most House seats this past election than in any year since 1974, using Pelosi to scare Fox News viewers into action doesn\u2019t seem to work anymore. Or, does Fox News\u2019s Ocasio-Cortez obsession come from a darker place?  Some call it \u201cwhite anxiety,\u201d while others, like myself, call it white supremacy. Fox News has a history of stoking racial divisions. Just take a look at Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham, who have used their shows to warn viewers about the \u201cbrowning\u201d of America.  Has Fox News decided that Ocasio-Cortez is the manifestation of that? In addition to being a Latina woman, she\u2019s calling for bold, progressive initiatives for America that Fox News has deemed socialism. (In reality, Ocasio-Cortez is a Democratic Socialist and is championing issues like Medicare for all and raising the minimum wage to $15 \u2013 not the government taking control of all means of production, as we would see in traditional socialist governments.) Though we cannot know Fox News\u2019s motivations with any degree of certainty, one thing is clear: The more viewers keep tuning into segments in which they obsess over Ocasio-Cortez, the more the network will keep producing them. So expect to see more of Fox News\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez derangement syndrome on display until the network can find a new \u201cvillain\u201d who plays better for their audience.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. The calls came fast, all with the same question: Is it true you are funded by George Soros? I was dismayed. I run a national racial justice organization, and a story had just broken that named us in a controversy. The New York Times reported that Facebook had sought to deflect blame for its role in empowering far right hate speech by, in fact, employing a right-wing media company to spread a soft, sanitized version of that same hate speech. And instead of holding Facebook accountable for that, these reporters just wanted me to confirm whether Soros was a funder. According to the Times report, Facebook had been trying to convince reporters that our campaign to push the social media giant into better behavior was secretly part of a coordinated effort undertaken by organizations funded by Soros. This is a thinly veiled version of a more sinister, increasingly pervasive theory: that organizations fighting for social change are secretly controlled by Soros and some master Jewish plot to take over America. White nationalists have been targeting Soros, an investor and philanthropist, for some time. Knowing that their conspiracy theories are echoing around the right-wing blogosphere is one thing. But hearing that those theories are being advanced by a company with the eyes of over 2 billion users is quite another. While Facebook has denied paying a media company to write news stories or spread information, if you trust The New York Times reporting, as I do, then Facebook allegedly used an outside company to point the finger at Soros. Why? Because the goal of these attacks is the revival of an age-old strategy of using anti-Jewish attacks to discredit all progressive social movements, including ours. Online hate is a deadly threat. When will tech companies finally take it seriously? In some ways, the report of Facebook\u2019s tactics is the most powerful proof yet that in the three years since Donald Trump announced his candidacy, white supremacy views and anti-Jewish conspiracy theories have moved into the mainstream. This fall, we saw the inevitable results of their success: violence. It started with a pipe bomb sent by a Trump fanatic to Soros himself and ended with the most deadly assault against Jewish people in American history in Pittsburgh. Yet violence is only the most extreme and obvious effect. If we fail to understand how white nationalist and right-wing attacks on Soros fit together with their perennial attacks on communities of color, we are missing their full strategy. We are also missing the threat it poses. The idea that my organization, for instance, is focused on what Soros is giving us, rather than on what conservatives are trying to take away \u2013 our vote, our health care, our liberty, our job protections \u2013 is a laughable distraction. But the idea that my organization is a pawn in someone else\u2019s game, rather than the self-determined and black-led force that we are, is dangerously undermining. The smears against George Soros are dangerous That our concerns and strategies are really a front for Soros\u2019 concerns and strategies diminishes not only our cause of challenging institutional racism, but also our standing and power in society. Soros is far from our only or largest funder. Undermining black people\u2019s power in this way benefits white nationalists obviously, but it also helps all those organizations whose decisions adversely affect black people but who want to avoid the accountability that our work demands \u2013 organizations like Facebook. It is just as true for all those whose activism and advocacy have been implicated in the attacks on Soros: immigrants, Muslims, feminists, LGBT people, Arabs and others. For instance, the same right-wing media claims about Soros pulling all the strings were made about women protesting then-nominee Kavanaugh, in order to dismiss their concerns without having to address them. And if you think the fear of black people and the fear of Jewish people are not being used in tandem, just watch the ad that closed out the election for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaigning arm of the Republican Party. The ad starts with Colin Kaepernick and ends with George Soros standing over a pile of money.  Quite simply, white nationalists and some on the right do not want anyone who is not like them to exist in their reality. They especially do not want progressive social movements to become more powerful. The conservative political establishment amplifying anti-Jewish conspiracies to win elections is no surprise \u2013 they have caved in to every opportunistic obsession of the far right. But they still deserve shame for doing so, and social media companies, like Facebook, that shrilly insist on their own independence from that conservative agenda must fully renounce these conspiracies \u2013 not willfully promote them. They need to acknowledge that these anti-Jewish attacks, in addition to their immediate threat to Jewish people, are an attempt to disempower a much wider set of people whom we all depend on to advance democracy, equity and justice in American society.",

Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law. He is the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cVote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting.\u201d Follow him @JoshuaADouglas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN. It\u2019s quite possible that voter suppression made the difference in the Georgia gubernatorial election, which Republican Brian Kemp narrowly won over Stacey Abrams, the Democratic candidate who was seeking to become the nation\u2019s first female African-American governor. Yet instead of simply conceding, Abrams has cast a cloud of illegitimacy over Kemp\u2019s victory, refusing to answer CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper as to whether Kemp legitimately won the election. Instead, she simply said that he would be the \u201clegal Governor of Georgia.\u201d That hedging is itself harmful to democratic legitimacy. While Abrams may have valid points \u2013 Kemp, for example, improperly used his position as secretary of state to influence the campaign, and promulgated voter registration rules that potentially shut out thousands of minority voters  \u2013 our democracy depends on the losers recognizing the winner\u2019s rightful claim to the elected office. Other candidates who have lost under a cloud of electoral improprieties have not questioned the final result in the same way. Most famously, Al Gore almost certainly should have won the 2000 presidential election, if not for the \u201cbutterfly\u201d ballot in Palm Beach County, Florida that confused voters who meant to vote for him. Justice Roberts, pay attention to what Brian Kemp did Many saw the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bush v. Gore, which ended the recount, as fundamentally unfair. George W. Bush won Florida by only 537 votes, which gave him an Electoral College majority. Yet in accepting his loss, Gore did not refuse to acknowledge Bush\u2019s win as \u201clegitimate.\u201d Of course, the situations are not exactly analogous: Unlike Kemp, Bush wasn\u2019t creating the rules of the game in the very campaign where he was a candidate (though arguably it is similar given that the person running Florida\u2019s elections at the time, Secretary of State Katherine Harris, was also serving as the co-chair of Bush\u2019s Florida campaign). To be sure, others suggested that Bush was not a legitimate President. But the losing candidate himself graciously accepted defeat. We will probably never know for sure if Kemp\u2019s actions, leading to voter suppression, may have changed the result in Georgia. Yet that\u2019s not as important as the underlying problem: voter suppression is never appropriate and we must do everything we can to make it easy for all voters \u2013 and especially racial minorities, given our sorry history of discrimination \u2013 to participate in our democracy. It\u2019s heartening that Abrams apparently plans to file a lawsuit to change Georgia\u2019s election processes and make it easier to vote. But there\u2019s a meaningful difference between challenging Kemp\u2019s voter suppression tactics and refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of his election while conceding the race. It\u2019s possible for Abrams both to lament the voter suppression that occurred \u2013 while pledging to fix it \u2013 and still recognize Kemp as the legitimate winner this year. I\u2019ve not been shy about criticizing Donald Trump and other Republicans for lying about voter fraud as a political maneuver to justify voter suppression. Though it\u2019s not exactly the same, Abrams\u2019 refusal to acknowledge Kemp as a legitimate winner also undermines the public\u2019s confidence in our electoral structure. Of course, that was likely Abrams\u2019 point \u2013 to draw attention to the election problems in the state. But the answer is to work harder for positive voting rights changes, not to question whether the winner actually has a rightful claim to the office.  \u201cVoter fraud\u201d has been the mantra of many Republicans who lose and do not want to accept the outcome. That has set a dangerous precedent, undermining the public\u2019s confidence in our elections. Democrats shouldn\u2019t follow their lead. As Abrams said in her CNN interview, words matter. Losing candidates should recognize the legitimate claim of the winner to the elected office. Then they should double down on their efforts to make our electoral system as inclusive and democratic as possible.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. 2018 isn\u2019t just shaping up to be a blue wave \u2013 it has also become a ballot measure wave. In ballot measure after ballot measure in the midterm elections, voters of all parties showed that when they get to weigh in directly on the issues rather than choosing candidates, they often vote for progress: for love, not hate; for inclusion, not division. For example, while gubernatorial and Senate races in Florida are still mid-recount, the results of the Amendment 4 campaign in that state were clear on election night. Florida voters voted handily to restore voting rights to formerly incarcerated people who have served their time and paid their debts to society, effectively re-enfranchising 1.4 million formerly incarcerated Floridians. It\u2019s hard to overstate just how critical a win this is for fair elections, criminal justice reform, and decency. It\u2019s harder to overstate how easily the measure won \u2013 with a massive, bipartisan margin of victory. 16 reasons to be excited about the midterm Rainbow Wave Given the unjust racial disparities in our nation\u2019s mass incarceration system \u2013 black and brown people are more likely to be arrested, prosecuted and given harsher sentences than white people for the same drug crimes, even though white people commit them at the same rates \u2013 this is a huge win for racial justice, and a huge blow to Florida Republicans\u2019 voter suppression strategy. But Florida wasn\u2019t the only state where ballot measures helped move voting rights forward in the midterms. Automatic voter registration, which disproportionately enfranchises young people and people of color, passed easily in both Nevada and Michigan, two traditional swing states. In Michigan, voters also used the power of the ballot initiative to expand voting rights: They approved same-day voter registration, made it easier to request absentee ballots, and reinstated straight-ticket voting. These changes passed decisively, 67% to 33%. Over on the East Coast, voters in Maryland passed a ballot measure to implement same-day voter registration by an equally wide margin. GOP opposition to birth control is politics, period But ballot measures didn\u2019t just lead to progressive change in voting rights. Across the country, in states red and blue, voters used ballot measures to: legalize recreational marijuana in Michigan and medical marijuana in Missouri and Utah, raise the minimum wage in Arkansas and Missouri, and eliminate the \u201ctampon tax\u201d (the sales tax on pads and tampons) in Nevada. In the ballot measures that may have the most significant immediate impact on the largest number of people, in Idaho and Nebraska, and Utah, voters expanded Medicaid, boosting the number of states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and bringing health care to an additional nearly half-million people. Those are people who will get covered in overwhelmingly red states, after the voters in those states chose to expand access to health care via a ballot initiative. Midterm results that will shape America's future The overwhelming progressive skew to Tuesday\u2019s ballot measure wins might seem counterintuitive. Voters expanding Medicaid \u2013 a plank in the Democratic, not Republican, party platform \u2013 in three of the biggest conservative strongholds in the country? Voters \u2013 across the country \u2013 supporting voting rights, criminal justice reform, raising the minimum wage, and more by numbers that far outpace support for Democratic candidates? These votes mean many more people, mostly working families who otherwise couldn\u2019t afford it, can access quality health care. They mean more rural hospitals stay open and portend substantial investment in job creation. All this will be a huge help to state budget bottom lines. The 2018 ballot measures and their outcomes show that most voters, even those in deep red states, prioritize their populations instead of partisanship. Progressives\u2019 record in ballot measures on election day wasn\u2019t perfect.  Unfortunately anti-abortion ballot measures seeking to deprive women of their freedom passed in Alabama and West Virginia. (Though, encouragingly, voters in Oregon rejected such a measure.)  But for the most part, progressive ballot measures won overwhelmingly this year, including in red states. There\u2019s an important lesson hidden here: When voters are given a chance to vote directly on the issues, they vote for progressive values.  2018 was a blue wave, but it was also a ballot measure wave. And there\u2019s no reason to think it\u2019s about to subside in future elections.",

Follow her @ProfKori. The views expressed here are solely the author\u2019s. View more opinion articles on CNN. Mississippi Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, who faces former Democratic Rep. Mike Espy in a run-off election on November 27, is facing public outcry after jokingly invoking \u201changing\u201d while campaigning in a state where lynching was once a common occurrence. \u201cIf he invited me to a public hanging, I\u2019d be on the front row,\u201d Hyde-Smith is heard saying in a video posted to Twitter Sunday morning. She was referring to a cattle rancher who supported her.  Hyde-Smith later issued a statement saying that she \u201cused an exaggerated expression of regard [for a supporter], and any attempt to turn this into a negative connotation is ridiculous.\u201d But her remark underscored a simple truth that many Americans prefer to ignore: Lynching and politics are inextricably linked.  Lynching literally shaped the political landscape Americans have inherited; our politics today are in part defined by the belief that white people should have the right to hold themselves and each other to incredibly low standards \u2013 that they shouldn\u2019t have to be decent toward people who aren\u2019t white. When white people have not actively worked to create a society fueled by fair play and equal opportunity, they have often ignored the political repression that mobs bent on extra-judicial \u201cjustice\u201d achieved \u2013 and the benefits, like power and economic success, they themselves have reaped as a result. Only a person whose ancestors or family members bore no risk of being lynched themselves would dismiss as \u201cridiculous\u201d objections to making hanging into a public political joke in Mississippi. Hyde-Smith\u2019s remarks and her defensiveness are indicative of the flawed but common arguments made by some white Americans that they bear no responsibility for structural racism and \u2013 as argued even recently by the President \u2013 that pointing out instances of racism is itself \u201cracist.\u201d We need the majority of white people to stop being content with the fact that there\u2019s no literal blood on their hands. We need them to hold themselves to a higher standard. Espy calls public hanging comments 'harmful' Many Americans underestimate lynching\u2019s political role because they focus on \u201cstrange fruit,\u201d the image of black bodies dangling from trees during the Jim Crow era, and think of those who left those bodies as bygone extremists. However, there was a social and political purpose for producing visual evidence of black people\u2019s vulnerability: to make them accept their \u201cproper,\u201d subordinate place in society. \u201cStrange fruit\u201d was also evidence of white people\u2019s freedom \u2013 to exercise power, to be citizens, to kill. Even those who did not take their freedom to that extreme were assured of it. If all they did was insult a black person or exclude them from opportunity, they could by comparison see themselves as liberal and tolerant. It is estimated that more than 4,400 African American men, women and children were lynched between 1877 and 1950, and these murders were designed to maintain the political hierarchy according to race.  As investigative journalist Ida B. Wells found in the 1890s, \u201cThe mob spirit has grown with the increasing intelligence of the Afro-American.\u201d I always say black success beckons the mob because white supremacist violence most often emerged to counter African American achievement. Mobs targeted black people who owned land that whites wanted to take; who were self-assured enough to defend themselves against assault or harassment, including sexual assault and harassment; or who sought political participation, including voting. Why Emmett Till's case matters to American history and our future The nation\u2019s African American lynch victims were often hanged, burned, or shot, but this brutality did not require hatred so much as it relied on the masses of white people holding themselves to low standards. As long as they weren\u2019t doing the bloody work themselves, these atrocities simply confirmed that they were \u201cgood\u201d people who had little in common with those who would join mobs. As long as the blood wasn\u2019t on their hands (or they weren\u2019t in the \u201cfront row\u201d), they were not part of the problem \u2013 and could pretend that their safe access to education and voting, for example, had nothing to do with violence. Many Americans also underestimate the political role of lynching because it was attached to the idea that black men are rapists obsessed with white women, but this is where Hyde-Smith\u2019s comments offer clarity again. When criticized for joking about a \u201cpublic hanging,\u201d she insisted that the only relevant context for understanding the quip was her \u201chigh regard\u201d for the person whose invitation she accepted. She\u2019s right. She was simply announcing her political allegiances. Hyde-Smith reiterated at a press conference Monday that she stands by her statement and Gov. Phil Bryant defended her, saying, \u201cI know this woman and I know her heart.\u201d GOP Mississippi senator facing criticism over comment about 'public hanging' But her heart isn\u2019t the point; lynching\u2019s role in shaping Mississippi politics is. The black rapist myth was so powerful there that the idea that 14-year-old Emmett Till might have whistled at a white woman got him killed. Its resonance can still be felt in the fact that Donald Trump could launch his presidential campaign by calling some Mexican immigrants \u201crapists.\u201d Its relevance can also be seen in the ease with which a white woman in Brooklyn (who has since apologized) sexualized a 9-year-old who accidentally bumped her behind with his backpack. For Hyde-Smith to gesture toward lynching was therefore especially freighted because white women often lent their femininity and purported need for protection to the cause of justifying other people\u2019s political disfranchisement. Without question, the threat of lynching was a major tool for what we now call voter suppression, so insisting that mobs formed because black men were rapists who targeted white women made white women important political pawns. Then and now, some white women like the proxy power that comes with being aligned with the powerful. Mike Espy, Hyde-Smith\u2019s African American opponent, lamented on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that her comments are \u201charmful because they tend to reinforce the stereotypes that have held back our state for so long and that have cost us jobs and harmed our economy.\u201d  As a candidate for statewide office, he is right to be concerned that his state will remain economically depressed, but unfortunately, many will tolerate such consequences. When white people hold themselves and each other to low standards, elites benefit and some white people suffer. But, because people of color bear the brunt, and because even white Americans who are harmed identify more with  powerful whites than with black and brown citizens, many see no reason to work for change.  Because racial violence has so profoundly shaped the entire American political landscape, all of us have to consider what Mississippi\u2019s past and present reveals about the country more broadly. We must confront this as an issue of decent behavior. White people must begin to redefine what makes them \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cdecent.\u201d They must ask, \u201cWhat actions have I taken that align with my claim that this is a country of equal opportunity?\u201d Only then can we begin to re-shape American politics.",

Turner is also a CNN national security analyst and the former director of communication for US National Intelligence. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Despite all appearances leading up to last week\u2019s midterm elections, the Republican Party is not inherently racist. That will come as a surprise to many of my Democratic friends, and for good reason. President Donald Trump has repeatedly disparaged and insulted people of color, even before taking office almost two years ago. From denigrating Judge Gonzalo Curiel, to asserting \u201cvery fine people\u201d were among neo-Nazi marchers in Charlottesville, to attacking the intellect of African-Americans, the President has embraced the power of racism. Trump\u2019s flirtations with open bigotry became more pronounced leading up to the midterms, as he rallied his base by proclaiming, to rousing applause, that he is a nationalist. He threatened to end birthright citizenship, and endorsed a campaign ad that paints Latinos as murderous criminals. Unsurprisingly, Republicans in elected office were unable or unwilling to mount any semblance of a full-throated condemnation of Trump\u2019s bigotry and race-based threats. On the campaign trail and in the press, they found refuge in suggesting that the President was misunderstood or that his comments should not be taken seriously. When the pressure to rebuke the President intensified, some mustered the courage to admit they would not have chosen those words, or suggested that Trump was just trying to motivate his base. Despite the President\u2019s shameless efforts to turn racial animus into votes, and the cowardice demonstrated by Republican leaders, it would be wrong for Democrats to label the GOP as racist. Trump's insults of black Americans are disgusting and dangerous The mainstream Republican Party is, in fact, made up of decent, hardworking Americans who believe in a core set of conservative values. Those include strong national security, lower taxes, adherence to free market principles, and limited government. They want their rights under the Constitution protected, the rule of law upheld, and individual freedoms respected. And whether we share their worldview or not, these ideals form the foundation of their Americanism. Conservatives who fit this description will tell you, with heartfelt sincerity, that their core values do not and will not ever include racial intolerance or bigotry. They believe that the legitimate principles of conservatism transcend race, ethnicity and gender and contribute to the prosperity of all Americans. Nonetheless, many mainstream conservatives continue to be confounded by the GOP having a clear, discernible and persistent race problem. According to the Pew Research Center, 84% of African-American voters identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party, while 8% align themselves with Republicans. Among Hispanics, 63% affiliate more strongly with Democrats, compared to 28% who lean toward the GOP. The numbers are virtually identical for Asian-Americans, who prefer Democrats over Republicans 65% to 27%. Exit polls from the midterm elections also show people of color voted overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats. Toobin says 'racial dimension' to Trump's attacks on black female journalists But the numbers painted a drastically different picture when minorities were asked specific questions about their ideology, including how large government should be and how much businesses should be regulated. When the American National Election Studies used this approach in a 2012 survey, it found 47% of African-Americans identified as liberal, while about 45% identified as conservative. As someone who grew up attending a largely black Southern Baptist Church, I saw firsthand how social conservatism was a core value \u2013 while voting was about electing Democrats. Instead of questioning why people of color with conservative values vote for Democrats, Republicans should ask why so many people with white skin and racist values embrace the GOP. For far too long, there has existed an uncomfortable relationship between the GOP and those who pander to intolerance, including the President himself.  But for all the decent, upstanding conservative Americans who reject racism and all it represents, it may be time to reconsider this unseemly union. I know it\u2019s not an easy sell, especially among politicians unwilling to leave votes on the table. They know that an outright and unequivocal rejection of all forms of bigotry, racism and intolerance would alienate a good number of voters. As the 2020 presidential election season kicks into full gear, it\u2019s time for mainstream conservatives to stop wondering why people of color disproportionally vote for Democrats. The answer is clear. For many conservative minorities, they see no place for themselves in a political party that both tacitly accepts and openly disparages people of color. When this reality shifts, so will the racial makeup of the GOP.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. It\u2019s not your imagination: President Trump, who regularly makes a point of personally insulting public figures who challenge or displease him in any way, taps into an especially toxic well of vitriol when aiming his attacks at black Americans. This week alone, Trump berated CNN correspondent Abby Phillip (\u201cWhat a stupid question. But I watch you a lot. You ask a lot of stupid questions.\u201d) He said of April Ryan, a reporter and CNN contributor who has covered the White House for 21 years:  \u201cYou talk about somebody that\u2019s a loser.  She doesn\u2019t know what the hell she\u2019s doing.\u201d And at a post-election press conference, when Yamiche Alcindor of \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d began to ask about accusations that his rhetoric may have emboldened violent white nationalist groups, Trump interrupted with, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you say that. That is such a racist question.\u201d The three women \u2013 all of them gifted, accomplished professionals \u2013 will be covering politics long after Trump has left the White House. They join a long list of athletes, entertainers, journalists and politicians who Trump routinely attacks as \u201cdumb,\u201d \u201cnot qualified\u201d or some such insult. None of this is subtle or secret; that would defeat the purpose. For Trump, loudly and publicly denigrating black figures is the whole point. President Trump threatens to pull more reporters' credentials He is a classic example of a backlash politician: a leader who exploits real or perceived white anxieties by exhibiting a flamboyant hostility to the political and economic demands of black Americans.  We\u2019ve had a string of such politicians since the civil rights movement, and that is neither surprising nor coincidental: Like many social revolutions, America\u2019s expansion of civil rights in the 1960s and \u201970s gave rise to a potent counterrevolution. We saw it in Ronald Reagan\u2019s decision to launch his 1980 campaign for president at the Neshoba County Fair in Philadelphia, Mississippi, where an infamous triple murder of civil rights organizers had occurred in 1964. Reagan didn\u2019t mention the martyred civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner or James Chaney in his speech, which was all about state\u2019s rights. As columnist Bob Herbert later noted: \u201cEverybody watching the 1980 campaign knew what Reagan was signaling at the fair. Whites and blacks, Democrats and Republicans \u2014 they all knew. The news media knew. The race haters and the people appalled by racial hatred knew. And Reagan knew. He was tapping out the code.\u201d Trump's new aggression is forcing the world to change once again Candidate Reagan, who had opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, went on to become President Reagan, who tried to weaken the Voting Rights Act and fought against making the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. a federal holiday. Trump knows the code. The prelude to his presidential run was his gleeful hyping of birtherism, a multiyear campaign of conspiracy theories and obvious lies that served no purpose beyond calling into question the legitimacy of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Trump has never renounced, or even acknowledged, the obvious racism of his birther falsehoods, and he never will. Birtherism \u2013 like talking about state\u2019s rights in Mississippi \u2013 was a quick, convenient way to attract people ready to push back against black advancement. \u201cThere was a shocking amount of resentment that a black family had been in the White House for two terms. I think it would be naive to overlook it \u2014 the irony that one of the legacies of Obama\u2019s presidency was an enormous amount of resentment,\u201d Harvard historian Henry Louis Gates said after the 2016 election. \u201cI don\u2019t think a Donald Trump could have emerged without a black president. Donald Trump tapped into and fueled and stoked an enormous amount of racial resentment. And Obama symbolized it.\u201d  With Obama no longer in the public spotlight, Trump has to play backlash politics with whatever black targets of opportunity happen to be around. That is why he never misses a chance to attack Rep. Maxine Waters, Don Lemon of CNN or the black reporters in the White House press corps. It\u2019s a disgusting and dangerous business: April Ryan has been subjected to death threats in the wake of Trump\u2019s verbal attacks. One can only hope the fever breaks soon, with the public signaling to political leaders that dividing and denigrating people is no way to lead a great nation.",

            "article_content": "Democrats took back the House by a decisive margin, while the Republicans improved their standing in the Senate, in a midterm election that \u2013 despite its significance \u2013 exposed the limitations of both parties for 2020. CNN commentators weigh in on the outcome and what comes next. Their opinions are their own. The blue wave happened Tuesday, and it was a big one. The congressional map was bad for the Democrats this year, with five Democratic senators running for re-election in states Donald Trump won by more than 19 percentage points. But the Democrats won control of the House, making it younger, darker and more female as they took at least 26 seats. But gerrymandering means the Democrats\u2019 relatively small majority in the House does not reflect reality: The Democratic margin of the popular vote was more than 9 percentage points, comparable to the 10.6% Democratic margin during the presidential election year of 2008, and above the midterm wave years of 1994 or 2010 in which Republicans won a 7.1% and 7.2% popular margin, respectively. The election has radicalized Republicans even further. They lost support in the Midwest and Rust Belt regions that were important to Trump\u2019s presidential victory, meaning there is little point in continuing to try to woo voters with economic arguments. But Republicans won in Texas and Florida, where their candidates ran campaigns that echoed Trump\u2019s racism and immigrant bashing. Structurally, Democratic pickups replaced less enthusiastic Trump supporters, moving the Republican leadership further right. It will embrace Trumpian tactics wholeheartedly. So while Democrats now control key House committees for oversight of Trump\u2019s finances, the corruption scandals surrounding some of his Cabinet officers and his campaign\u2019s possible ties to Russia, Republicans have more incentive than ever to support the President and his agenda. Republicans have to face the other key takeaway from the evening: If they are unpopular now, it will be worse in 2020. Voters on Tuesday restored the voting rights of 1.4 million Floridians who have been disenfranchised (Trump won Florida by about 100,000 votes); endorsed redistricting reform in Michigan, Colorado and Missouri; and took control of the Supreme Court of the heavily gerrymandered North Carolina, which will revisit that issue. Kansas rejected the gubernatorial bid of voter-suppression operative Kris Kobach, and Brian Kemp\u2019s suppression of votes in Georgia has attracted national disgust that bodes well for reform. The wave looks more and more like a running tide. Expect Republicans to fight and claw to hold on. Heather Cox Richardson is a professor of history at Boston College. Her most recent book is\u201dTo Make Men Free: A History of the Republican Party.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s Democratic victory for control of the House shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, given that many of these felled GOP candidates were in districts where Hillary Clinton won and President Donald Trump lost the popular vote in 2016. But the Republican Senate gains and strong Florida and Georgia gubernatorial showings ran counter to the mainstream media bubble\u2019s narrative; elite media would be wise to self-reflect. America is now at a juncture: Will a divided Congress collapse into a vitriolic abyss of presidential House impeachment (and subsequent Senate acquittal), endless House Russia conspiracy theories, subpoenas and baseless investigations? Or will Democrats and Republicans work together to fight the opioid crisis, rein in our deficit and reform our education and criminal justice systems? If House Democrats choose the former, they will weary the American people and face a similar electoral outcome in 2020 to that of congressional Republicans in 2000 \u2013 losses in both houses \u2013 after they impeached President Bill Clinton. Americans signaled Tuesday night they want a bipartisan Congress, not a polarized one. President Donald Trump was penitent a day before this disappointing House finish: \u201cI would like to have a much softer tone,\u201d he told the Sinclair Broadcast Group. \u201cI feel to a certain extent I have no choice, but maybe I do and maybe I could have been softer from that standpoint.\u201d Suburban voters, including many women, were key in flipping these House districts, and Trump is noticing. He\u2019ll need conservatives of every stripe to build on his agenda heading into 2020. Carrie Sheffield, a conservative commentator, is national editor for Accuracy in Media, a citizens\u2019 media watchdog. If Tuesday proved anything it is this: Sisters are doing it for themselves, as the catchy \u201980s tune by the Eurythmics and Aretha Franklin goes. \u201cStandin\u2019 on their own 2 feet. And ringin\u2019 on their own bells.\u201d And ring the bells we did from sea to shining sea Tuesday as a record number of women \u2013 mostly Democrats \u2013 ran for office for the first time. And while women didn\u2019t win it all, we did compete strongly and registered wins in key congressional and municipal seats across the map. And when all the votes are counted, it\u2019s likely, more than 100 women in almost every demographic will be heading to Washington in January. In a historic first, Massachusetts voters elected Democrat Ayanna Pressley, who will become the state\u2019s first black congresswoman. Michigan Democrats also turned out huge for women. The state elected women for every statewide office on Tuesday\u2019s ballot: governor, US senator, attorney general and secretary of state. Native American women also made history: Sharice Davids (Kansas) and Deb Haaland (New Mexico) elected to Congress \u2013 a first for America. Muslim women have arrived: Detroit-born Democrat Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota are headed to Congress \u2013 the first Muslim women to do so. But there were complications for progressive women. Georgia\u2019s Stacey Abrams has fought a good fight to become the nation\u2019s first black female governor \u2013 some say with one hand tied behind her back \u2013 against Republican nominee Brian Kemp, who as secretary of state is Georgia\u2019s top election official. Abrams has not conceded and has a slim chance of moving on to a runoff. Despite celebrity backers such as Oprah Winfrey, Abrams faced a wave of alleged voter suppression tactics, including lack of power cords for voting machines in majority-black voting precincts and a new \u201cexact match\u201d voting law, as well as a mass removal of tens of thousands of inactive voters from the state rolls. If the Abrams race tells us anything, it is that voter suppression is real, and unless we can enact measures to protect voting rights, women such as Abrams will always have an uphill battle in states where old racial attitudes play a particularly antagonizing role. Still, women have left their mark in 2018. A record 257 of us ran for the House and Senate this year, according to The New York Times. Whether inspired by Hillary Clinton\u2019s historic presidential run (or Trump\u2019s), the Women\u2019s March, or the empowerment of the #MeToo movement, it\u2019s clear women are marching on Washington, and we are here to stay.

Yes, the party took the House, but the blue wave was not the tsunami party leadership had hoped it would be.  This is in large part because the Democratic party is still searching for its post-2008 identity. It wants to represent the young and diverse, but key leadership roles continue to be held by the old and the white, much like the Republican Party it chastises. In 2010 and in 2014, Democratic incumbents seeking re-election distanced themselves from President Barack Obama\u2019s policies, not because they disagreed with them but because they weren\u2019t popular.  As repulsive as some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policies may have been to Republicans over the past two years, you did not see the same level of retreat from them in this election as Obama experienced in his 2010 midterm shellacking.  Which is why the Democrats\u2019 victory was not so resounding. Say what you will about the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d slogan, the reality is that it\u2019s effective because it is a clear, proactive message.

Follow him on Twitter and Instagram @lzgranderson. On Tuesday night I spoke at the Democratic Party\u2019s victory party.  Before I mounted the stage, I asked Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi what she wanted me to say.  \u201cDon\u2019t make it about President Trump,\u201d she cautioned, \u201cand certainly don\u2019t make it about me. Make it about the candidates and the volunteers and the voters.\u201d I tried to follow her wishes, but let me take a minute to praise her now.  Nancy Pelosi was the subject of tens of thousands of attack ads.  She was demonized, vilified, and caricatured.  And yet she persisted. And now she has won.  Nancy Pelosi, along with Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-New Mexico, the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has taken back the House of Representatives, giving Democrats their first taste of real power on the federal level since Donald Trump was inaugurated. She did it by maintaining grace under relentless pressure.  With Lujan she recruited strong candidates who fit their districts: women, veterans, moderates.  Most of all, she did it by keeping her eyes on the prize: making the election not about her \u2013 nor, crucially, about Donald Trump \u2013 but about the people of this country.  Her slogan said it all: \u201cFor the people.\u201d There is an important lesson here for both parties.  As the old saying goes, \u201cIf you don\u2019t stand for something, you\u2019ll fall for anything.\u201d  Republicans didn\u2019t stand for anything. They didn\u2019t run on the strong economy. They didn\u2019t run on their corporate tax cut.  They didn\u2019t run for anything.  They just ran against Pelosi.  And they lost. Democrats, too, need to remember the lesson of this election.  Led by Pelosi, they refused to fall into the impeachment trap, declined to base their message on hatred of Donald Trump.  Instead, they ran on health care, Social Security, infrastructure, and education.  Democrats stood for something.  Republicans fell for anything. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and was counselor to Clinton in the White House. He was a consultant to Priorities USA Action, which was a pro-Obama super PAC before it was a pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC. Democrats should not be surprised to find that they just guaranteed six more years of President Trump. At 9:30 p.m., Fox News called the House for the Democrats.  Though Republicans will hold the Senate, any defeat is a serious wound for conservatism.  Expect many leading House Democrats to spend more time now on eradicating the opposition through investigations, hearings, and impeachment than on crafting traditional liberal legislation.  Democrats have raised health care and the poor during the campaign, but those traditional issues have been drowned out by allegations of the evils of their opponents. The results trickled in during an anxious day and \u2013 with so many races too close to call \u2013 a breathless night.  Why so tense? Because, in 2018 America, only in politics is the battle of left vs. right unresolved.  The big institutions are solidly lined up against believers in traditional sex roles, family values, God, and country. Hollywood doesn\u2019t like them, nor do Silicon Valley, academia, public schools, the art world, most newsrooms, big funders like the Ford Foundation and the Koch brothers, and corporate America, whose human resources tell social conservatives that their beliefs are backward and discriminatory.  The Democratic Party got rid of pro-lifers years ago, and even most church leaders have made their peace with secular culture and leaned liberal. That means the ballot box is the sole place where conservatives can fight and win.  Every election, in that case, is existential.  If conservatives lose, progressives have the chance to stamp out conservatism forever.  If conservatives win \u2026 well, they survive until the next election. Those were the stakes tonight.  Elections are no longer who\u2019s-up-and-who\u2019s-down.  They are: does-conservatism-live-or-die. The Senate is still Republican, and every attempt the Dems make to discredit Trump won\u2019t pass the upper chamber.  They will, instead, arouse conservatives of all kinds, who understand the annihilating intent of liberalism better than the Democrats and commentators think.

The House Intelligence Committee under Democratic control can now shift the focus away from the Republican strategy of trying to expose the FBI\u2019s methods and sources, to calling important witnesses to testify about their knowledge of the Trump campaign\u2019s contacts with Russia during the 2016 election. And they can use the committee\u2019s subpoena power if necessary. Although Mueller is investigating these threads as well, the public will be able to get a fuller and more direct window into what took place through a congressional investigation, rather than having to rely only on piecemeal information revealed in criminal indictments from the special counsel investigation. Midterm results that will shape America's future Most importantly, when Mueller submits his final report to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the House Judiciary Committee will be able to request it from the Department of Justice, and make it public if it deems that it is warranted. All of these actions will make it much harder for the White House to block or bury evidence of any alleged collusion or obstruction of justice, whether or not Mueller or Rosenstein are fired. Asha Rangappa is a senior lecturer at Yale\u2019s Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. She is a former special agent in the FBI, specializing in counterintelligence investigations. Follow her @AshaRangappa_ Not a bad night for Donald Trump. Not at all. Having lost the House, the President won\u2019t be able to push forward much of a legislative agenda during the coming two years.  Truth be told, though, he never had much of a legislative agenda.  He\u2019s about to be pounded by investigations and subpoenas for all manner of misdoings.  This is a President, though, who lives for the counterpunch.  Meanwhile, Republican control of the Senate offers insurance against impeachment, and the support Trump needs to continue appointing conservatives to the judiciary. Nothing about tonight\u2019s electoral returns meaningfully impinges upon the President\u2019s foreign policy.  And with Congress divided, Trump can continue to exercise his unilateral powers as aggressively as ever \u2013 eliminating business and environmental regulations, taking substantive and symbolic stands against immigration, delivering favors to key Republican constituencies.  No midterm repudiation of this President tonight.  No blue wave washing up on the White House doorstep.  No mid-course correction.  For that, we\u2019ll have to wait until 2020.  For that, voters will need to vote Trump himself out of office.  In the meantime, settle in America.  Trumpism lives on. William Howell is a professor of political science at the University of Chicago and co-author, with Terry Moe, of \u201cRelic: How Our Constitution Undermines Effective Government \u2013 And Why We Need a More Powerful Presidency.\u201d Our country now has its first openly gay governor, from Colorado. The first Native American woman, the first and second Muslim women, and the youngest woman ever will be part of the largest cohort of women to join Congress. Changes are coming in from all levels of the political structure. The citizens of Florida voted to reinstate the voting rights of 1.4 million people \u2013 former felons who had been denied the vote. Voters in Massachusetts defended the rights of transgender people in public spaces. Forget the demographic projections for 2050; America is definitively a different country today as a result of the 2018 midterm elections. People with a variety of identities that go well beyond straight, white, and male are changing the political structure in ways that have national implications. This reality about America will continue to scare Donald Trump and the people he relies on to keep his power. The President will double down on spinning stories of caravans of diseased terrorists coming to take away your guns and make your kids gay. When Trumpism gets worse, can we rely on this new crop of political leaders to bridge the divides in our country? Democrats in Congress will wage the necessary legal battles to protect our democratic institutions, but the rest of us will need to double down on the daily battle to Make America Normal Again. We need to transfer the energy from the ballot box into the social courage necessary to challenge hate, fear, and bigotry when it confronts our communities.

When I first heard a Democratic congressman from El Paso was going to run for the US Senate from Texas and he was beginning his campaign by traveling to all 254 counties, I laughed. Yeah, out loud. I\u2019d been to all of them as a journalist, or riding my motorcycle, and it took me a couple of decades. And what was the point of an aspirational politician traveling to Loving County in the Panhandle, with a population of 134 people in 677 square miles? Of course, Beto O\u2019Rourke wanted to make sure each potential constituent understood they mattered, and he\u2019d serve everyone. Beto may have lost, but he\u2019ll keep rolling. His journey is only beginning. He has awakened the moribund Texas Democratic Party, which can now see a brighter future for candidates and fund-raising. The enthusiasm and hopefulness he generated also undoubtedly helped the election of the state\u2019s first two Latina congresswomen, and unseated longtime incumbent Republicans John Culberson of Houston and Pete Sessions of Dallas. O\u2019Rourke may have lost only because he waited too long to broadcast attack ads against Sen. Ted Cruz. But he showed Democrats how to raise money without selling out to PACs and corporate interests, how to maintain your principles and win with a message of uniting Americans. And whoever wants to be the next Democratic president will need to consider Beto as a running mate. Biden-Beto 2020? Or maybe O\u2019Rourke just needs to fire up his own presidential run. James C.

In the end, President Trump\u2019s strategy of ignoring the center and playing to his base by ginning up anti-immigrant angst \u2013 something we haven\u2019t seen from a White House in the modern era \u2013 failed to keep suburban America in the Republican camp. Despite a strong economy and foreign policy wins, the Republicans went all-in on immigration, and as a result Democrats now control the House of Representatives. In the context of divided government, where do we go from here on the vexing and complicated issue of immigration? Despite vitriol, division, and searing images of young children being separated from their parents, millions of Americans in suburban communities are looking for compromise. These are the voters who gave power back to the Democrats.  They are the two-thirds of Americans that More in Common\u2019s research identified as the \u201cExhausted Majority:\u201d they dislike polarization, they are largely ignored in a fragmented media environment, and, in fact, they are flexible in their views. And, most importantly, they seek leadership that can unify the country.  To find a compromise, we must address underlying fears around identity, culture, security and economics. When we show curiosity and empathy, we can build a coalition to make reforms most Americans support: improving the legal immigration  system, bolstering security at ports of entry and at the borders, and extending citizenship to undocumented individuals who are already contributing to America. We\u2019ve gone through a tremendously difficult time, with newcomers pegged as scapegoats for global migration, economic changes, and new cultural norms. But there\u2019s good news as we return to divided government: most Americans want progress \u2013 and consensus \u2013 on American immigration. Can Congress live up to this challenge?

In the months leading up to Tuesday night\u2019s midterm elections, the references to the blue wave emoji symbolizing a \u201cwave\u201d of hoped-for Democratic victories grew legion on social media like Twitter.  The emoji\u2019s artwork derives from ukio-e artist Hokusai\u2019s iconic Japanese woodblock \u201cThe Great Wave off Kanagawa.\u201d Typically generated by earthquakes deep beneath the ocean floor, tsunamis originate far from shore in waves as low as a foot but travel at speeds up to 500 mph. Before they hit land, a vacuum effect often first draws back the waters, revealing terrain and debris usually hidden. This fearsome natural phenomenon is an apt metaphor for our country\u2019s current politics. Like a deep earthquake, Trump\u2019s election triggered waves of disbelief, anger and, ultimately, a coalescing of like-minded people. As they neared the midterm, these waves pulled back the surface waters of American life revealing underlying hatred, misogyny, racism and violence. The Democratic Party\u2019s blue wave made landfall Tuesday night in a terrain-changing slew of victories in the House of Representatives. Whether the victories reached as far as the Senate or governorships is not as important as the fact that the tsunami was born and arrived. Its full effect is yet to be fully known since water both cleanses and destroys. And tsunamis arrive seriatim.

All eyes are on the battle to control the US House of Representatives. But the fight to occupy a handful of governor\u2019s mansions may hold more important keys to the Democratic Party\u2019s strategy for 2020. Gubernatorial elections always matter. The winners on November 6 will affect the lives of millions of people in the 36 states and three territories where governor\u2019s races are being held. Someday, one of these leaders could even end up being president of the United States (17 previous Presidents have been former governors). But there is an additional reason this year to watch these contests. Inside the Democratic Party, a battle is raging over both demography and philosophy. It all comes down to whether, in the Trump era, Democrats should nominate heterosexual white men with more moderate views \u2013 who theoretically could more easily appeal to Republican-leaning moderates and independents. The high stakes of the 2018 governor races Or should Democrats nominate people of color, women and LGBT candidates who espouse strong progressive views and who might better motivate the Democratic base? A growing number of Democratic activists are fed up with the party being dominated by politicians who don\u2019t look, think or live like most Democratic base voters. These rebels believe that more progressive and diverse candidates would give the Democrats a clearer path to victory. The outcome of Tuesday\u2019s election, particularly the governor\u2019s races, will give insight into whether their strategy is sound. Here are the governor\u2019s races I am watching that are poised to make history: Georgia. House Democratic Minority Leader Stacey Abrams is up against Republican Secretary of State Brian Kemp. If she wins, Abrams would be the first black woman governor in US history. For a long time, Georgia Democrats put up conservative white Democrats who went down to defeat. Now, with Abrams offering a bold alternative that appeals to an increasingly multiracial, working-class state, the race is among the closest in the country. So close, in fact, that Kemp\u2019s history of trying to pick his own voters by purging voter rolls (something he denies doing) \u2013 and his refusal to step down as Secretary of State, where he will administer his own election \u2013 has become a major flashpoint. Florida. Perhaps no contest better captures the peril and possibility of American politics better than the governor\u2019s race in this battleground state. Rep. Ron DeSantis surged to win the Republican primary by defending Trump at every turn. But after securing the nomination, he revealed himself by warning Florida not to \u201cmonkey this up.\u201d Most Floridians heard a clear reference to his opponent, Andrew Gillum, who is black. It's not the 'Year of the Woman.' It's the 'Year of the Women' Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, shocked the political world with a surprise victory in the primary. Like Abrams, he put forward commonsense policies to retake power from elites. But I think his grassroots campaign, focused on reaching and organizing a multiracial coalition, will matter more to whether or not he wins than his progressive positions. This race could show whether Trump\u2019s divide-and-conquer strategy might outlast the candidate, or fall short against unity candidates. Maryland. Entrepreneur, lawyer, and civil rights activist Ben Jealous is trying to unseat Republican Governor Larry Hogan. Even though Maryland is a far bluer state than either Georgia or Florida, Hogan is quite popular. Still, this is one of those races where a blue wave could surprise prognosticators. Jealous\u2019 embrace of bold policies like Medicare for All and free college tuition, among others, has the potential to resonate across racial lines. And a surprising uptick in early voting might portend an upset win for Jealous. America has elected only two African-American governors in the modern era: Douglas Wilder, elected in Virginia in 1990 and Deval Patrick, elected in Massachusetts in 2006. 14 midterm races that could change America America could more than double that number this year by electing three in one night \u2013 Abrams, Gillum and Jealous. At a time when white supremacists are marching openly, that is a welcome and inspiring prospect. Idaho. A longshot of longshots made possible only by an inspiring candidate. Paulette Jordan is a 38-year-old state legislator and Coeur d\u2019Alene tribal council member who has captured the imagination of young people, women and minorities in this deeply conservative state. Recent shake-ups in her campaign staff make this an unlikely test of whether that new coalition can win in Republican strongholds. But it is still worth watching \u2013 if she wins, she would be Idaho\u2019s first female governor and the nation\u2019s first Native American governor. Colorado and Vermont. Rep. Jared Polis, the Democratic candidate in Colorado, is vying to become the nation\u2019s first openly gay governor. It is a tight race that his conservative voting record in Congress makes tougher by deflating grassroots energy. In Vermont, Christine Hallquist has already made history as America\u2019s first openly transgender major-party nominee for governor and is in an uphill battle to go one step further. I would be remiss if I failed to note Arizona, where Democrat David Garcia is mounting a surprisingly potent campaign to be that state\u2019s first Latino governor in decades. Though less historic, Ohio is also on my radar, where consumer advocate Richard Cordray is running for governor, and there is also the possibility that GOP stalwarts Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Kris Kobach in Kansas may have overreached and will be punished at the polls.  If even one of the history-making candidates above wins on November 6, it would represent a rejection of both Donald Trump\u2019s politics and the play-it-safe Democratic strategy of the past. Demographically, these races preview the future of the Democratic Party and of the United States. The only question is whether that future arrives \u2013 in political terms \u2013 this year or in years to come.",

Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights and constitutional law. He is the author of the forthcoming book Vote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting. Find him at www.joshuaadouglas.com and follow him on Twitter @JoshuaADouglas. American democracy is exceptional for many reasons. One of the most concerning but least understood is that partisan, elected officials run our elections. Instead of having nonpartisan, professional election administrators \u2013 the norm in most other democracies \u2013 self-interested politicians dictate the rules of the game. Elections should be won on ideas, not election rules. Having election officials dictate the rules for the very elections where they are on the ballot is like allowing an umpire in a baseball game to hit cleanup for his or her preferred team while also calling balls and strikes. Three secretaries of state are running for higher office this year while still administering the elections where they appear on the ballot. Republican Brian Kemp of Georgia and Republican Kris Kobach of Kansas are both running for governor in their respective states while also serving as secretary of state. Ohio Secretary of State Republican Jon Husted of Ohio is running for lieutenant governor. These officials have used their offices to promulgate rules that could affect their elections. Why the midterm elections scare me The latest partisan abuse has come from Georgia\u2019s Kemp, whose office on Sunday indicated that it had opened an investigation into state Democrats for \u201cpossible cyber crimes.\u201d Even if there is any merit to the allegations \u2013 and it\u2019s impossible to know from the secretary of state office\u2019s brief statement, though indications are that it\u2019s actually Kemp\u2019s office that has been lax in the security of its system \u2013 it is highly improper for a politician to use his official office to attack his political foe in this way, all while in a heated race for the state\u2019s top job. This action follows Kemp\u2019s office potentially disenfranchising thousands of voters by placing their registrations in a \u201cpending\u201d status because the voter registration forms did not \u201cexactly match\u201d other information in the state\u2019s databases, such as when a last name had a hyphen on the voter registration form but not in the DMV database. The rule disproportionately affects racial minorities, which is particularly concerning given that Kemp is running against Stacy Abrams, who seeks to become the nation\u2019s first African-American female governor. A court last week ruled that Kemp must allow thousands of these individuals, flagged for potentially being noncitizens, to vote if they can prove their citizenship at the polls. Kansas\u2019s Kobach, too, has used the power of his office to increase his electoral chances. After the August primary, when the count was exceedingly close between Kobach and incumbent Governor Jeff Colyer, Kobach initially refused to recuse himself from overseeing the recount of that election. Kobach was going to be in charge of a recount that would determine the winner in an election in which he was a candidate! He later agreed to recuse, but only after public outcry. Kobach has also used unsupported fears of voter fraud, with zero evidence, to advocate for stricter election measures that would make it harder for many people to vote. Not surprisingly, those most affected by these voter restrictions are those who would likely oppose him at the ballot box. But advocating for certain election rules is one thing; dictating the rules in an election when he is a candidate presents a whole different set of ethical concerns. It's not the 'Year of the Woman.' It's the 'Year of the Women' Ohio\u2019s Husted has been less overt in using election rules to affect his election, but he did fight a lawsuit that challenged the state\u2019s aggressive voter purge system, winning a case at the Supreme Court this past June. However, a court last week ruled that the state must count provisional ballots from some voters who did not receive proper notice that the state was purging them from the rolls, and Husted did not appeal the decision given how close it was to Election Day. For a public servant, the line not to cross is clear: Election officials should not determine rules that would affect their own elections. If Kemp and Kobach were to look over their shoulders, they would see that line far behind them. Yet the problem is not limited to these two Republican election officials. More than half of the states choose their chief election official (most often the secretary of state) in a partisan election. Most local election officials, who actually run the elections in their localities, are also partisan and elected. These officials are typically highly professional and simply want to run a fair election. But the very nature of their office as being partisan and elected opens the door to potential bias. No wonder a majority of the public supports election officials to be nonpartisan. Confessions of a voting freak To maintain the fairness and sanctity of our elections, Kemp, Kobach and Husted must all agree, before Election Day, that they will recuse themselves from any electoral issues, including recounts, involving their own elections. As the European Commission for Democracy Through Law (Venice Commission) notes, \u201cOnly transparency, impartiality and independence from politically motivated manipulation will ensure proper administration of the election process, from the pre-election period to the end of the processing of results.\u201d  Moving forward, states and localities should change their laws so that secretaries of states and local election officials are explicitly nonpartisan officials not subject to elections where they can dictate the rules for their own elections. Voters, too, can play an important role. Regardless of party, vote for secretary of state candidates who pledge to be nonpartisan champions of voting rights. There are individuals who, if elected, will put the needs of voters and their role as public servants above their partisan and personal gain. That\u2019s who should run our elections.",

            "article_content": "Since the early primaries began for the 2018 midterm elections, it\u2019s been a year of firsts and to many, a year of the woman. In the midst of this election, the first significant national vote since the election of Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination and confirmation battle only amped up the existing pressure on questions of gender, power, women\u2019s health and women in elected office. CNN Opinion asked thinkers to weigh in on 2018 as a Year of the Woman. The views expressed here are solely theirs. One can be heard without being listened to. Women voters have long felt the impact of this nuance, and the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing exemplified it. Both sides of the political aisle preached that women, particularly women alleging sexual misconduct, should be heard. Cries for due process, notice of the charges against someone accused and meaningful opportunity to be heard echoed throughout both chambers of Congress and reverberated throughout the nation. The actual mechanisms to facilitate sound were provided: a microphone, a camera, and a platform. The intangible mechanisms of listening, however, were regrettably absent.  Women noticed. Hearing is passive and non-purposeful. Listening is an action. Women voters should and are demanding more than patronizing passivity.  As was the case in the year following Anita Hill\u2019s testimony more than a quarter century ago, women are keenly aware (perhaps now more than ever) that they cannot afford to wait for receptive ears. Women are prepared and capable of voting for (or being elected by) those whose policies in practice reflect our collective values, strengths, empathy, intellect, and power. The Venus symbol for women is thought to represent a bronze mirror atop a handle. For at least the past two years, women have held a mirror up to America and recoiled at its reflection.  The democratic fairy tale doesn\u2019t exist. The only thing coming to save us is a ballot in shining armor. When we raise our voices on Election Day to ask the proverbial \u201cMirror Mirror on the wall, who\u2019s the right candidate to listen to us all?\u201d - - a woman will respond. Laura Coates is a CNN legal analyst. She is a former assistant US attorney for the District of Columbia and trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. She is the host of \u201cThe Laura Coates Show\u201d on SiriusXM. Follow her @thelauracoates. It\u2019s more than a little difficult to get excited about this so-called \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d in politics.  While I would love to believe that a larger female share of federal lawmakers will mean a better life for US women, I don\u2019t have the evidence to support this, especially considering women\u2019s record since the last year of the woman, 1992. I think this is because a lot of female politicians \u2013 like a lot of male politicians \u2013 mistake legalized abortion or free contraception for the sum of \u201cfeminism,\u201d while failing to solve the problems women suffer most. Women are pro-life and pro-choice, while indisputably in serious need of other kinds of laws and policies. Women suffer more poverty than men and need state action prioritizing the poor. Women practice religion more than men, being more likely to pray daily, attend services weekly, and report that God is very important in their lives. Women are more likely than men to report that they would like to have more flexible work arrangements and paid family leave to care for loved ones. To date, however, both female and male politicians spend most of their time attending to middle-class and wealthier Americans. And I can\u2019t point to sustained, bold action on the part of female representatives on religious freedom or paid or flexible leave. I haven\u2019t given up hope that elected women will bring women\u2019s needs to the table more forcefully. I am only saying that their sex doesn\u2019t guarantee it, and that female citizens will not be absolved of their duty to agitate for what women need most. Helen Alvar\u00e9 is a professor of law at George Mason University who has published widely on issues of marriage, family, parenting and First Amendment religion clauses. Her recent book with Cambridge University Press is about putting children\u2019s interests first in US family law. The year 1992 was the first election year to be proclaimed the \u201cYear of the Woman.\u201d It was the year after the Anita Hill hearings \u2013 and the year when an unprecedented number of women ran for office. Illinois\u2019 Carol Moseley-Braun won her race, becoming the first black woman ever elected to the Senate. Along with her, a wave of women took political office. Now, in 2018, it\u2019s been 26 years since the \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d \u2013 and yet, we still live in a country where women are treated as lesser, where medicine is designed often without women in mind, where maternal mortality rates are far higher than those of our peer countries. And where a man credibly accused of sexual assault and harassment can still be confirmed to the US Supreme Court. In 2018, another \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d won\u2019t be enough. It isn\u2019t enough to elect women \u2013 though we urgently should do that. And it isn\u2019t enough to believe women like Dr. Christine Blasey Ford if you still choose to confirm her alleged attacker to the Supreme Court. So if 1992 was the \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d, then 2018 must be the \u201cYear of Accountability.\u201d And in the \u201cYear of Accountability\u201d, we must demand accountability from everyone who fails to support women and our needs, no matter their race, gender, or political party. We will demand accountability from the 45 men who voted for Brett Kavanaugh, as well as Susan Collins and the four other Republican women in the Senate who joined her. We will demand accountability from the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump. We will demand accountability from every member of Congress and local government who fails to adequately address the maternal health crisis that disproportionately affects black women. In 1992, the \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d was an important and consequential feat, bringing our country\u2019s electoral representation closer to our demographics. But we\u2019ve learned from time and experience, and from our greatest teachers, that simply supporting women isn\u2019t enough. In 2018, women need more than just support and votes. We need full accountability. Karine Jean-Pierre is the senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn. She is also a lecturer in international and public affairs at Columbia University. No matter what happens on Tuesday, the record number of women running for election this year is undoubtedly going to change politics permanently, for the better.  But what\u2019s also significant is that many of the women running aren\u2019t conventional candidates.  These aren\u2019t elite career politicians making their run at the next rung of politics.  They\u2019re single moms and school teachers and public interest lawyers who want to make a difference for their communities and their countries. Take Kara Eastman, a Democrat running in Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District.   Raised by a single mom, Eastman started the Omaha Healthy Kids Alliance to ensure that children have access to homes free of lead and other environmental hazards.  And she was on the board of her region\u2019s community college.  She\u2019s running against an incumbent Republican who has vowed to gut the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of Labor. Or consider Katie Porter, a Democrat running for California\u2019s 45th Congressional District.   Porter has spent her career as a consumer protection attorney going after big banks financial institutions that cheat consumers.  She teaches consumer law and was appointed a few years ago by then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris to be the state\u2019s watchdog against big banks.  Porter is running against a Republican incumbent who was an investment banker until entering politics 22 years ago. A community-based environmental activist challenging an anti-EPA climate-change denier and a banking consumer watchdog challenging a big-bank friendly career politician. These challengers aren\u2019t just changing politics because they\u2019re women. They\u2019re changing the game with their range of expertise and experience they bring to the table as candidates who represent real people and their concerns, not just special interest elites.  Politics will hopefully never be the same. Sally Kohn is a CNN political commentator and author of the book, \u201cThe Opposite of Hate.\u201d A scandal-tarred, extremist Republican. Accusations of sexual misconduct. A southern state where Democrats rarely compete. Attempts to suppress the black vote. A multi-racial, populist coalition putting in the work. That was the scene in December 2017, when Doug Jones upset Roy Moore in a special election for Alabama\u2019s Senate seat. Now, with 2018 tagged as a successor to 1992\u2019s \u201cYear of the woman,\u201d that Alabama contest deserves a second look. In the wake of Jones\u2019 surprise victory, it quickly became clear who was responsible for it: black women. Black women put in the long hard volunteer hours. Black women got their families, friends, neighbors and churches to the polls. Black women voted 98% for Doug Jones. It is really no surprise. Black women have been the backbone of the Democratic Party for decades. All that has changed is that women of color are starting to get the credit they deserve. They are also in leadership roles. That is an overdue and welcome development. From Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts to Ilhan Omar in Minnesota to Stacey Abrams\u2019 historic bid for governor in Georgia, black women are not just singing in the choir but preaching from the pulpit. That fact is even more true when you pull back the lens and look at the waves of all women of color \u2013 Native American, Palestinian, Latina, more than I can mention \u2013 determined to make history in November. In the GOP stronghold of Idaho, a young Democrat named Paulette Jordan could become the first-ever Native American governor. With all the attention on the new \u201cYear of the woman,\u201d I hope we do not lose sight of the beautiful rainbow of women of color who are leading the charge and organizing behind the scenes. Whether or not a blue wave materializes, their voices and concerns deserve to be at the center of conversation in 2019 and beyond. Van Jones is the host of the \u201cThe Van Jones Show\u201d and a CNN political commentator. He is the co-founder of #cut50, a national, bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps. Women are the backbone of American democracy. We made up 55% (far greater than men\u2019s 45%) of the 2016 electorate, and we are an undeniable force for social change. Women are running for office in record numbers this year, and when the Election Day dust settles, I\u2019d wager we\u2019ll be positioned for historic impact on Capitol Hill and legislatures nationwide. In 2014, when Democrats tried to project a phony \u201cWar On Women\u201d mantra against Republicans, accusing them of holding women back, I found it ironic that on Election Night 2014, it was the first female combat veteran to be elected to the Senate \u2013 Republican Joni Ernst \u2013 whose victory tipped the balance of the Senate into Republican hands. Ernst is a fighter for women \u2013 and for all people, both at home and overseas. We\u2019re seeing Democrats reaching for this familiar but tired tactic in 2018, and I believe we\u2019ll see a similar outcome to 2014. America\u2019s women are smarter than to fall for a manufactured \u201canti-woman\u201d narrative against Republicans, who are economically empowering America\u2019s middle class, both men and women.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, annualized, median weekly take-home pay was just $43,368 at Q3 in 2016, compared to $46,436 at Q3 in 2018. This is an increase of $3,068, which is a substantial raise of 7%. The weekly pay increase was roughly the same for women and men. The polling is mixed among GOP women about Judge Kavanaugh in the wake of the Christine Blasey Ford hearings, but I personally was incredibly motivated to speak out about the unfair way that Democrats exploited the #MeToo movement for political points. I know many other conservative women who feel the same way. Democrats\u2019 rejection of due process for Kavanaugh is backfiring \u2013 it\u2019s motivating conservatives to turn any Blue Wave into a Blue Trickle. Carrie Sheffield, a conservative commentator, is National Editor for Accuracy in Media, a citizens\u2019 media watchdog whose mission is to promote accuracy, fairness and balance in news reporting. Stacey Abrams is on the cusp of breaking one of the tallest glass ceilings in our country. Should her campaign to be governor of Georgia prove successful on November 6, she will be the first black woman governor in the United States. The possibility of this historic moment is breathtaking for all of us, but it is a particular game-changer for women like me, who grew up under a monolithic prescription for success. As a girl and later as a woman, I was often told to wait until I was married or to go make more money or to lose weight. When I was in high school in the late 90s, my mom used to have \u201cthe talk\u201d with me. \u201cTam, you\u2019re a black woman, you have to work extra hard, dress impeccably, and be above reproach.\u201d Back then, I thought success included being a certain dress size, wearing your hair straight and long, getting married and having children.  When Hollywood cast black actresses as successful working women, they looked like Robin Givens. I spent a ridiculous amount of money to add bundles of hair to my head. I tried every fad diet. When I got a little older, my heart sank with every friend\u2019s engagement and birth announcement that came my way. Even as I achieved recognition for my community and professional work, there were times that I still felt unfulfilled because I didn\u2019t look like Gabrielle Union in \u201cTwo Can Play That Game\u201d nor have a husband and children like Rainbow on \u201cBlackish.\u201d Last fall, I was scrolling through Facebook when a video popped on my timeline. The video introduced me to Stacey Abrams: a Yale law school graduate, former deputy city attorney of Atlanta and then-Minority Leader of the Georgia House of Representatives. I was in awe as I watched, but not because of her enormous levels of success, but because Stacey Abrams looked like me. She wore her hair in a short natural style and she had curves and cushions like many Southern girls. And also like me, she was not married, had no children, and had student debt. At the time, I was weighing the possibility of running for office in my hometown of Memphis for a second time. Stacey Abrams was a needed affirmation that my body type, my hair, my finances nor my marital status discounted my potential to lead or make change. Stacey Abrams empowered me to see myself and my future through a different lens. I went on to run for office with renewed confidence. I won my election for County Commissioner in August of this year and I\u2019ve never been prouder to stand tall and lead as a black woman than I am in this moment in time because of the rise of women like Stacey. On November 6th, I hope Stacey will be victorious and that her victory is even sweeter knowing she has broken the mold of success. Tami Sawyer is a commissioner on the Shelby County Commission in Memphis and a social justice advocate. In many ways, I think the fact that Donald Trump, an accused serial sexual harasser, got away with his abhorrent conduct and rhetoric to win the presidency helped ignite the #MeToo #TimesUp movement. The power dynamics used against women were no longer restricted to the shadows. In his words and actions, Trump put this behavior front and center. It became clear to me things would be different from now on when the Women\u2019s March drew three times the turnout that Trump\u2019s inauguration did. This was a turning point. Passive resistance was not an option. The visual of half-a-million Americans uniting to support the empowerment of women would inspire a higher level of participation in the political process that is unprecedented and historic. The events of the past few weeks have only fanned the flames of the women\u2019s movement in this country. Dr. Christine Blasey Ford facing a Senate Republican Judiciary Committee that was made up of all white men. Trump labeling multiple allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh a \u201choax.\u201d Trump attacking Stormy Daniels by calling her \u201chorseface.\u201d Trump attacking multiple female journalists accusing one of \u201cnot thinking\u201d and telling CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins \u201cdon\u2019t do that\u201d when she asked him a question. The coming November midterms amount to a reckoning against all the men in Congress who have enabled Trump to continue degrading women and protecting those who oppress them. Make no mistake about it, this isn\u2019t the culmination of this movement, it\u2019s just the beginning of a process that will permanently change the political dynamics in this country. Kurt Bardella is the former spokesperson for the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee and for U.S. Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Maine) who left the Republican Party last year to join the Democratic Party. Follow him on Twitter: @kurtbardella. Since January 21, 2017, we knew this day was coming. More than 4 million people around the world joined the Women\u2019s March. In the last two years, according to the Washington Post and Kaiser Family Foundation, 1 in 5 Americans have marched or protested. The number one issue motivating them is women\u2019s rights. The #MeToo movement has swept our culture, bringing stories of sexual assault and harassment out of the shadows. Women\u2019s marches and protests have not stopped the Trump administration from following through with his threats to women\u2019s rights. He tried (and repeatedly failed) to overturn the Affordable Care Act and block patients from coming to Planned Parenthood for care with defunding efforts. He\u2019s since proposed a gag rule to prevent doctors and nurses who participate in the nation\u2019s family planning program from telling patients all their options when it comes to pregnancy. And he\u2019s appointed two blatantly anti-abortion justices to the Supreme Court, one despite accusations of sexual assault and a national outcry against the nomination. President Donald Trump and his allies in Congress have ignored women\u2019s outrage at every turn, attacking our rights and our ability to make our own decisions about our bodies and futures. During the last \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d election, the 1992 midterms, a record four women were elected to the US Senate, and a record 24 to the House. It was an important moment. But as then-Sen. Barbara Mikulski said, \u201cCalling 1992 the Year of the Woman makes it sound like the Year of the Caribou or the Year of the Asparagus. We\u2019re not a fad, a fancy, or a year.\u201d This year, with our health and lives on the line, we need more than a moment. So we\u2019ve built a movement. Planned Parenthood Action Fund is running its largest-ever midterm effort to turn out voters who believe in reproductive health and rights. November 6, 2018 will not just usher in \u201cThe Year of the Woman.\u201d It will mark a shift in who holds political power in this country. Not only because a record number of women are running for office, but also because the vast majority of organizers, activists, donors, and voters for progressive candidates are women. And together, these women aren\u2019t giving up or backing down. Dawn Laguens is the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund. I think the biggest difference between this year and 1992\u2019s \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d (and \u2013 as Slate\u2019s Lila Thulin has pointed out \u2013 the many years that have been dubbed \u201cYear of the Woman\u201d before and since) is the breadth of diversity among the candidates. Among the female candidates running serious races with real chance of winning are out lesbians and bisexual and transgender individuals. There are an unprecedented number of female military veterans and there are disabled woman candidates. And where race and ethnicity are concerned, the number of nonwhite women running for office \u2013 black, Hispanic, Asian, Middle Eastern and Native American \u2013 has outstripped any prior electoral field. In short, while prior years might have deserved the designation \u201cYear of the Woman,\u201d in 2018 we are finally seeing the \u201cYear of the Women\u201d \u2013 a plural, inclusive and intersectional representation that\u2019s poised to shatter our preexisting stereotypes of female leadership. Jeff Yang is a frequent contributor to CNN Opinion, a featured writer for Quartz and other publications, and the co-host of the podcast \u201cThey Call Us Bruce.\u201d He co-wrote Jackie Chan\u2019s best-selling autobiography, \u201cI Am Jackie Chan,\u201d and is the editor of three graphic novels: \u201cSecret Identities,\u201d \u201cShattered\u201d and the forthcoming \u201cNew Frontiers.\u201d Part of the reason why incumbents in Congress nearly always win reelection is that really good candidates almost never run against them. But what if a new type of candidate started running, one who is motivated not by getting to win public office itself, but by having the opportunity to help their communities? These new candidates, according to a study in \u201cPolitical Psychology,\u201d are more likely to be women. It\u2019s no surprise that the GOP is on a collision course with demographics as their party ages. Millennials prefer the Democratic Party by nearly 60%, but as the youngest generation in the electorate, they are also the least likely to vote. Importantly, though, the question of how long the Republicans are safe remains almost entirely up to one group: Millennial women, 70% of whom identify most closely with the Democratic Party and who are most enthusiastic about voting in the upcoming midterm elections. Indeed, millennial women have likely already changed the political landscape with the record-breaking surge of women candidates running for office, not only because they are a different gender of candidate, but they may be a different type of candidate altogether. Democrat Joe Crowley is perhaps the best-known of the 2018 class of heretofore-entrenched incumbents. He became a Congressman when his boss, the previous incumbent, hand-picked him in 1998. With a loss being inevitable, no high-quality candidates stepped forward until Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a political activist who had previously not considered running for office, decided \u201con a lark\u201d to run because she wanted to affect change. She did not wait for the most strategic time to run. She just ran. And she defeated him soundly. Republicans may also be robbing future turnout to pay for current turnout. Older women are much more supportive of #metoo than are older men, but no such gender gap exists for younger people. Being on the \u201cwrong\u201d side of #metoo may hurt the Republicans not only with women in the future, but with men, too. The only question is how long it will take for millennials to start making their political mark. If some projections are correct and millennials vote in record numbers in this election, the future is already here.

She is co-editor of the State Politics and Policy Quarterly, a political science journal focusing on state politics. 2018 has been a year when more women have recognized how intertwined gender, economic, and racial justice are \u2013 that one doesn\u2019t happen without the others, so we must unite to rise together. It\u2019s also been a year of tremendous backlash. From Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation, to rolling back protections for women\u2019s healthcare provided by the Affordable Care Act (ACA),  and even to a man on a plane groping a woman and trying to excuse his behavior to officers with, \u201cthe president of the United States says it\u2019s OK to grab women by their private parts\u201d; the backlash has been strong and ubiquitous. To say the \u201cpatriarchy\u201d has fought back from a place of fear is an understatement. Ironically, the strength of that backlash is one of the best measures of the power of these intersecting concerns can have when women of different racial, regional, and economic backgrounds \u2013 and their allies \u2013 unite to rise together. That backlash only strengthens our resolve. Women are not giving up.  2018 is the year that the \u201cDecade of Women\u201d begins. In our last midterm election, only 36% of eligible voters bothered to vote. This year, it\u2019s time to use the election as a launching point into a new era when having this many women on the ballot and winning primaries and elections is commonplace, not cause to deem it a \u201cYear of the Woman.\u201d That starts by making sure all our friends, family, and neighbors vote along with us, next Tuesday and in every election.  Women hold the hope, the dreams, the joy, and also the rage, as well as the will and the strength to build a nation where everyone can thrive. We are half our population and we brought the other half into the world.  Together we are the loud, visible, and necessary force our nation needs right now.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. It\u2019s hard to find a political issue as simultaneously silly and salient as flag-burning. And yet, it is suddenly before us in the Georgia governor\u2019s race between Brian Kemp and Stacey Abrams. With only days to go until the midterm elections, of course it\u2019s the time for candidates who fear they can\u2019t win fair and square to pull out all the dirty tricks. And few have been dirtier than Kemp, who is also Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State and has been putting tens of thousands of voters\u2019 registrations in the state on hold, most of them African-American, under the state\u2019s \u201cexact match\u201d law. And now, suddenly, on Monday \u2013 the \u201ceve of her first debate Tuesday with her Republican opponent,\u201d said the New York Times \u2013 a video surfaced on social media; it is aimed squarely and transparently at riling up a racist base. It shows Stacey Abrams, at a burning of  the state flag in 1992. Flag burning is, of course, a protected form of expression, but conservatives \u2013 the same people who are currently positioning themselves as free speech warriors \u2013 have repeatedly tried to outlaw it. The only reason is that it offends their sensibilities \u2013 including those of our \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d President. (Attempts to outlaw flag-burning are fundamentally anti-free-speech, but still, symbols matter, and for many Americans, the American flag is a sign of pride in our country.) Abrams: Voting should not be a trust issue But Abrams didn\u2019t participate in a burning of the American flag. She didn\u2019t even burn the current State of Georgia flag. More than a quarter-century ago, as a college student, Abrams took part in the expressive burning of the former state flag \u2013 which proudly included the Confederate battle flag emblem. That state flag wasn\u2019t some storied part of Georgia\u2019s history; it was adopted in 1956, after the Supreme Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that public schools had to racially integrate. The confederate symbol was placed on the Georgia state flag in direct response to racial integration. It was placed there to make clear that the powers that be in Georgia opposed racial equality. It was nothing other than a big, deliberate, and clear middle finger to African-Americans. That is what Stacey Abrams burned \u2013 not a symbol of Georgia itself or of the state\u2019s history, but a symbol that was affixed to the flag to send a message that whites are superior to blacks. Defenders of the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments can\u2019t have it both ways. They like to say, as Kemp does, that liberals are trying to erase history; they often say that the flag is about \u201cheritage not hate.\u201d But if the goal is truly to understand history, then we must all look directly at the fact that the history of Georgia\u2019s flag is one in which the white legislature intentionally incorporated a Confederate symbol to demonstrate its hatred of racial integration. Is that a flag that deserved respect? Voter registration uproar in Georgia Gov. race Georgia didn\u2019t think so \u2013 the state changed its state flag in 2001, and removed the Confederate battle flag entirely in 2003. Other Republicans, including Nikki Haley, have also criticized the Confederate flag \u2013 Haley said that it should never have been on South Carolina statehouse grounds. Flag-burning is a jarring act because it is a symbolic desecration. But whether one finds that desecration offensive or not depends on what the flag symbolizes. For many Americans, our national flag symbolizes the best of our country: Freedom, democracy, and all the potential America offers its people. For others, burning the American flag is an expressive repudiation of American war-mongering, hegemony, and unearned exceptionalism. Fair-minded people can hold differing views on what our national flag means, and by extension, the relative offensiveness of burning it. There isn\u2019t the same debate around the now-defunct Georgia flag that Abrams, as a young college student, participated in burning as part of a peaceful protest. The foul history and the ugly motivations behind the flag are the same reasons the state eventually adopted a new design. So why are we discussing this now? Kemp supporters are banking on the hope that it will hurt Abrams\u2019s campaign. There are indeed white voters who cast their ballots on identity politics alone, in favor of candidates they see as upholding their unearned racial supremacy and against those candidates they see as pushing for a more equal playing field. S.C. Governor: Flag \"never should have been there\" This story is nothing other than a right-wing attempt to inflame the kind of voters who will be offended by a black woman protesting a symbol of racial hatred. The GOP should be ashamed that they receive such support, not salivating for it. If Abrams wins, she will be the first African-American female governor in the country \u2013 an especially remarkable milestone in a state with a particularly brutal racist past. Abrams has spent her life as an advocate and a dedicated public servant, trying to make sure that the many people long erased from Georgia\u2019s history and disenfranchised from its institutions could also participate in public life and live free of discrimination. This election shows how much women like Abrams have changed their communities and their country \u2013 and how much still remains stubbornly stuck. Abrams\u2019s act more than 25 years ago was a statement against racism and segregation. It was a statement in favor of the full participation of all Americans, no matter their skin color. Believing that your country can and must be better is what patriotism looks like, and it\u2019s what the best of Georgia looks like \u2013 not segregation, and not the flag created in support of it. Her act wasn\u2019t offensive, but her opponent\u2019s attempts to exploit the racist inclinations of his white base certainly are. If protesting and destroying an object expressly designed as an expression of racism is, as Kemp has portrayed Abrams, \u201ctoo extreme for Georgia,\u201d then Georgia needs to take a hard look in the mirror.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: In a new series of weekly columns (available soon as a newsletter), we\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. After weeks of excruciating buildup, the end to the Brett Kavanaugh saga came fast and furious. Fast on the part of the Republicans who would not let Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation to the Supreme Court be derailed by accusations of sexual assault and lying that they dismissed. Furious on the part of everybody, it seemed \u2013 those who considered the nominee manifestly unsuitable both for his views and the allegations about his behavior, and those who argued that a good, innocent man had been smeared. Across the nation, the days leading up to the confirmation vote were a total immersion in issues of gender, power and politics. Coming exactly a year after the Harvey Weinstein scandal ignited the #MeToo movement, the debate over the nominee and the roles of women and men showed no sign of stopping. Writing for CNN Opinion, actress and activist Alyssa Milano saw a straight line between the abuse allegations leveled at both Kavanaugh and Trump and charges of sexual violence, abuse and neglect of migrant children \u201cseparated from their families by the Trump regime\u2019s cruel and unnecessary family separation policy.\u201d  She wrote: \u201cCan we doubt that, if we confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, this further institutionalization of sexual violence will not rear its ugly head in myriad unseen ways throughout our nation?\u201d And Caroline Criado Perez drew a parallel between the pro-Kavanaugh GOP and the international soccer hierarchy, which closed ranks after a teacher accused star footballer Cristiano Ronaldo of raping her. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest about this. For a brief moment, institutions may make sad faces about tough decisions\u201d and sexual assault. \u201cBut then institutional muscle memory will take over, and they will revert to type.\u201d A \u201ccharade,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis of the additional FBI background probe into allegations that Kavanaugh sexually abused women in both prep school and at Yale, \u201cmeant to give the GOP a way to confirm Kavanaugh without paying a political price.\u201d They\u2019ll pay anyway in the midterm elections, she wrote. (History, and Trump blowback, says it will probably be a very bad election for Republicans, wrote Trump adviser Jack Kingston.) Kavanaugh himself wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal. He admitted saying some bad things at his hearing, but denied \u201cwrongful and sometimes vicious allegations\u201d against him and insisted he would be an independent justice and \u201ca team player.\u201d (Three of his Yale drinking buddies parried, in a Washington Post op-ed, saying that he lied under oath and \u201cshould not sit on the nation\u2019s highest court.\u201d) President Donald Trump got involved, and on Tuesday, in front of a cheering crowd, he made fun of Christine Blasey Ford (\u201cWonder why victims of sexual assault don\u2019t come forward?\u201d asked Tara Setmayer) and called it \u201ca scary time for men.\u201d Scott Jennings wrote that Susan Collins\u2019 speech Friday announcing she\u2019d vote for Kavanaugh was a brave rebuke to Democrats who had reflexively rejected Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination: \u201cNevertheless, she persisted. Susan Collins is a hero for standing up to mob rule in America.\u201d And never-Trumper New York Times columnist Bret Stephens decried \u201cthe facile stereotype of \u2018white privilege\u2019 that keeps cropping up in discussions of Kavanaugh\u2019s background,\u201d and said he was \u201cgrateful that, in Trump, at least one big bully was willing to stand up to others.\u201d As a full vote on Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation approached, author Diane McWhorter had a warning for Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who by Friday had indicated he\u2019d vote yes on Kavanaugh: \u201cAny Democratic complicity in elevating Kavanaugh will mean that the cancer on this presidency, already in stage \u2018what did he know and when did he know it,\u2019 has metastasized to the opposition.\u201d That\u2019s key, wrote Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist, who had changed her mind about Kavanaugh after the hearings:  \u201cLike the two women who confronted Jeff Flake on the elevator told him, confirming Kavanaugh means \u2018my pain does not matter.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s a message that runs both ways, wrote CNN commentator Kirsten Powers in USA Today, recounting her own assault at 15: \u201cWe cannot send teenage boys the message that they can sexually assault someone and, as long as they eventually become good citizens, we will elevate them to one of the most important positions in our society.\u201d Nearby, as thousands of enraged demonstrators protested Kavanaugh outside the Supreme Court and in the Hart Senate Office Building, Republicans John Cornyn, Orrin Hatch and Chuck Grassley faced TV cameras and vowed that \u2013 like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 they would not be intimidated.  (Hatch showed how this worked in a viral video in which he told a group of mostly female protesters who confronted him at an elevator to \u201cgrow up.\u201d) \u201cLudicrous,\u201d wrote Sally Kohn, who said protest is democracy in action.  \u201cApparently, Republicans think the only ones who should be doing the intimidating is them. We\u2019ll pause here to recall the wave of angry and in-your-face protests by a different sort of \u2018Tea Party\u201d that swept American politics in 2010, propelling Republicans to Congressional victory.\u201d It\u2019s not so OK when it\u2019s close to home, wrote Kelley Paul, who says she upped security at her house after her husband, Sen. Rand Paul, was recently doxed \u2013 all part of an effort to intimidate Republican members of Congress that she says was not helped by Sen. Cory Booker telling activists they should \u201cget up in the face of some congresspeople.\u201d Take it back, she said. Out of context!, replied Booker\u2019s communications director, Jeff Giertz. Booker was urging \u201cmembers of a nonpartisan, non-profit organization dedicated to ending homelessness to \u2018get up in the face of some congresspeople and tell them about commonsense solutions\u2019 that address this problem.\u201d Deceptively edited video in hyperpartisan publications are the problem, he wrote \u2013 \u201cspreading disingenuous and dishonest information about political opponents and presenting it as news.\u201d For only the third time, a woman, Donna Strickland, of Canada, won the Nobel Prize in physics. Scientist Don Lincoln worried that focusing on her gender \u201cseems to me to draw attention away from her accomplishments.\u201d Her work, on laser pulses that will help explore the tiny world of bacteria, \u201cis brilliant and should speak for itself.\u201d There was big news for women in the NFL, too, as ESPN\u2019s Andrea Kremer and Hannah Storm became the first female team to call an NFL game package. Great, wrote Roxanne Jones, a former vice president at ESPN, but I\u2019ll save my end-zone cheers \u201cfor the day I see women well-represented in broadcast booths all across television networks, not to mention the executive offices of media companies that for too long have relegated women to the sidelines in sports.\u201d In a vast expos\u00e9, The New York Times reported that Trump, his siblings and his father, Fred Trump, bilked their fellow Americans of hundreds of millions of dollars through tax avoidance games and \u201cloan\u201d legerdemain over decades. \u201cMoney that came from all of us, an opportunity lost,\u201d observed tax expert Edward McCaffery, noting that \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 \u201cTrump\u2019s one major legislative accomplishment, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017, were more, not fewer, tax breaks for billionaires, including a severe gutting of the gift and estate tax.\u201d Of Trump, he says, \u201cThis particular apple never really left the tree.\u201d But baloney about his wealth has long been part of Donald Trump\u2019s shtick, writes his biographer, Michael D\u2019Antonio, including the story of the $1 million his dad staked him \u2013 more like $60.7 million, says the Times. \u201cRemember how then-candidate Donald Trump talked about how the \u2018system is rigged\u2019?\u201d asked D\u2019Antonio. \u201cHe really knew what he was talking about.\u201d It\u2019s what happens when \u201cpublic figures who are clearly \u2018born on third base\u2019 insist they hit their own triple,\u201d writes Chuck Collins, and it\u2019s easy to see the parallels to Brett \u201c\u2018I-worked-my-tail-off\u2019-to-get-from-prep-school-to-Yale\u201d Kavanaugh. Such mythology around entitlement makes society blind to real \u201cstructural inequalities and unequal opportunity. If everyone is where they deserve to be, why should anyone be troubled about decades of stagnant wages or a persistent racial wealth divide?\u201d When Donald Trump\u2019s acting EPA chief Andrew Wheeler \u2013 a former coal lobbyist \u2013 announced plans to reverse the country\u2019s clean-car standards, he was rolling back \u201cthe most effective policy we have on the books to fight climate change,\u201d wrote Christine Todd Whitman, former New Jersey governor and EPA administrator under George W. Bush. The Trump administration\u2019s \u201ctoxic agenda\u201d should bring citizens to the barricades, she said. And \u201cwhile the public hearings may be over, the public can still submit comments into the federal register until October 23.\u201d Last summer\u2019s wildfires were a scary reminder, wrote Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, that on Nov. 3, climate change is on the ballot: \u201cElect governors and state legislatures who will push back, who will work to transform our nation\u2019s energy and transportation systems and reduce the carbon pollution\u201d hurting communities, he said. \u201cAmericans don\u2019t have to wait for Washington, D.C. Donald Trump cannot stop us in the states.\u201d And Frank Bainimarama, Prime Minister of Fiji, and Hilda C. Heine, President of the Marshall Islands \u2013 Pacific island nations besieged by flooding, droughts and typhoons \u2013 called for solutions through the UN Convention on Climate Change: \u201cstrengthened targets and long-term decarbonization plans by 2020\u201d to keep earth temperatures lower and safer. Leaning on the Talanoa Dialogue at the upcoming COP24 meeting in Poland \u2013 \u201cbased on the concept of an open, honest and respectful process of dialogue used in the Pacific\u201d \u2013 could help. \u201cThe idea of Talanoa is to bring the best ideas for how to tackle this threat to the surface and share them.\u201d  Ready? 435 House and 35 Senate races and 36 gubernatorial contests. We asked 14 contributors \u2013 left, right and center \u2013 which races to watch. For Raul Reyes, that\u2019s Beto vs. Cruz (\u201cDemocrats\u2019 best chance in years to turn Texas blue\u201d). SE Cupp noted the Arizona US Senate race, which holds the possibility of a woman AND a Democrat, Kyrsten Sinema, gaining a seat that has been red since 1988 and male since forever. Alice Stewart said \u201cGeorgians will come home to the GOP\u201d and its candidate, Brian Kemp, in the gubernatorial race. And Van Jones is keeping an eye on Maryland, where the governor\u2019s race pits Republican candidate Larry Hogan against former NAACP President Ben Jealous, who is \u201ceverything that Trump is not.\u201d Read them all here. Melania Trump\u2019s photo-op visit to four African nations last week was a \u201cwaste of US taxpayer money and a waste of African time and attention,\u201d wrote Christine Mungai, who lives in Nairobi. She called it a pointless gesture from the wife of a President under whose administration \u201cnorms have been shaken from their foundations, where political mores have been trashed and where seemingly naked power rules the day.\u201d Instead, \u201cif Melania wants to get a feel for China\u2019s influence in Africa, and what that means for US dominance in the region, she should take a ride on the Madaraka Express from Nairobi to Mombasa. The railway is Chinese-financed, built and run, and the United States, through the construction firm Bechtel Corporation, is trying to counter by building a brand-new highway along the same route.\u201d  Still, she said, \u201cI hope she has a good trip.\u201d",

He has spent 15 years in Asia and reports on Korean affairs for the South China Morning Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Once the home of free-market capitalism and a hawkish view of our adversaries, the Republican Party continues to support President Donald Trump despite his protectionist trade war with China and dovish bond with Russian President Vladimir Putin. One eventually has to ask whether anything would be enough to unmoor such obedience. Though not a perfect parallel, recent events in South Korea may shed light on this question. Like Trump, former President Park Geun-hye was elected in 2012, partly thanks to a disinformation campaign (state prosecutors said the government\u2019s chief intelligence agency posted 1.2 million-plus Twitter messages to sway public opinion in her favor), support from rural voters in the nation\u2019s southeast (the stronghold of the conservative party), a potent dose of rosy retrospection (make Korea great again) and an indeterminate amount of racism. These last two are part of the legacy Park rode in on, that of her father, the dictator Park Chung-hee, who is credited with modernizing the nation\u2019s economy and who promoted a belief in Korean racial purity that remains problematic today. Though it\u2019s difficult to say how much a role these two factors played, there was certainly some nostalgia among her supporters for the \u201cMiracle on the Han\u201d and the miracle of the Han \u2013  the former being the period of growth that carried South Korea from postwar poverty to becoming the economic power it is today, and the latter being a belief in the purity and greatness of the Korean race, a belief that still has some traction but is especially noticeable in North Korea, according to B.R. Myers, a professor of international studies at Dongseo University in Busan (who has written a book on the topic titled \u201cThe Cleanest Race\u201d). Other possible similarities between Trump and Park include using the seat of office for personal gain (something for which Park has been found guilty but for which Trump, it must be noted, only stands accused of by critics), granting a loved one top-level access, targeting members of one\u2019s own party who aren\u2019t sufficiently loyal and claims by supporters that the subsequent probe into her abuse of power and bribery allegations was a witch hunt. The President who got impeached for being embarrassing Still another similarity is that, for a while at least, she seemed unbeatable. Even after her botched handling of the Sewol tragedy in 2014 (in which a ferry carrying mostly high school students sank, killing 304 passengers and crew), she bounced back with a 20-point surge in her approval rating \u2013 from 34% to 54% \u2013 in late 2015, a result of her hardline stance against North Korea. But by late November 2016, she had dropped to an abysmal 4%, according to a Gallup Korea poll. Even staunch supporters in her own party abandoned her in droves. It\u2019s hard to imagine something similar taking place in the United States under almost any condition. So, what did it take for Korean conservatives finally to wake up to the news? Park\u2019s downfall didn\u2019t begin with her baroque scandal, which involved giving top secret information to her Rasputin-like confidante, her involvement in a reportedly shamanistic cult, a McCarthy-like blacklist and her receipt of more than 23 billion won ($20.66 million) in bribes. It began months before, when Park\u2019s conservative party lost 24 seats in the 2016 legislative elections, falling 146 seats down to 122 seats in the 300-seat National Assembly. It was a devastating loss, attributed to her party\u2019s deselection of candidates who were seen as insufficiently loyal. Koreans saw this as an affront to their democracy and voted accordingly, marking the start of Park\u2019s precipitous decline in approval and robbing her of any political capital with which to weather the coming scandal. Second, people hit the streets. On one Sunday in December 2016, up to 2.3 million protesters showed up to demand Park\u2019s resignation amid the corruption scandal. It was the largest rally in the nation\u2019s history. Rejecting the old narratives of racial and economic pride, Koreans turned to a different page in history: the democratization movement of the 1980s. Park\u2019s election as South Korea\u2019s first female President had made the nation seem more \u201cwoke\u201d than most, and the economy was on a tear, bleeding liberal activists of their raison d\u2019\u00eatre. But her corruption scandal gave the nostalgic left the perfect reason to replay a classic \u201980s hit. Social tuning, or the process of adopting other people\u2019s attitudes, almost certainly also played a role here. If you turned on the nightly news to see a major protest in New York, your likeliness of siding with the protesters will probably increase with their size. Given enough people, you might feel yourself facing a choice between the remaining members of your party and your fellow Americans. South Korea is a society that emphasizes education. It has among the highest global literacy rates in science, reading and math. It also has the highest rate of tertiary education in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. This is a well-educated population with an existential reason to stay at least moderately well-informed. The 2012 campaign to spread disinformation may have tipped the scales for Park, but generally speaking, their level of education means that South Koreans are not easily taken in by false reports. It\u2019s also worth noting that Korea is home to a different business model for online news outlets. Instead of resorting to subscriptions, donations or traffic from aggregators, outlets can partner with Naver, the so-called Google of Korea. This means Naver pays news outlets to feature their content, theoretically allowing for sweeping changes to rapidly defend against disinformation, such as banning the use of automation software. But the business model is not without problems of its own \u2013 a Korea Bizwire report from April noted that \u201cNaver has been accused of being complicit in spreading fake news and rigging public opinion.\u201d Warrant sought for former South Korean President In response, Naver CEO Han Seong-sook pledged in May a complete overhaul of the site, such that the company will no longer edit or arrange news, but will leave that to news outlets themselves. This is a crucial step, because as with Facebook, its dominance (most Koreans reportedly get their news from Naver) offers great opportunities for change but comes with serious risks. Although there are several similarities between Trump and Park, it would be foolhardy to push the comparison too far. For one thing, Trump has not been accused of taking bribes as Park has. Also, during Park\u2019s scandal, South Korea was experiencing rising unemployment and household debt, problems Trump doesn\u2019t have. His protectionist policies will likely bring them on, but only time will tell. And some may argue that unity in South Korea wouldn\u2019t have been possible were it not for the fact that it lacks significant racial diversity, but this ignores the very deep divisions in Korean society along regional, religious, economic and political lines. Yet Koreans overcame these divisions. Conservatives, in particular, chose to invest in democracy rather party politics, and Park\u2019s party nearly broke in half. Back in America, there are good reasons to be hopeful. The formula outlined above is a simple one \u2013 speak up, stand up, read up \u2013 and Americans are doing well. Democrats appear to be winning the race for Congress, and four of the biggest protests in US history \u2013 the 2017 Women\u2019s March, the 2018 Women\u2019s March, the March for Our Lives and the 2017 March for Science \u2013 have taken place since Trump assumed office. The government is also actively investigating Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign, while social media giants such as Facebook, which aggregates the news for many in ways not unlike Naver, scramble to address the issue.  This is not an argument for complacency. Voter turnout could be higher, activism stronger and the public can always be better informed. If anything, we should stay on this road and step on the gas. At his 500-day mark, Trump had the second highest \u201cown party\u201d approval rating of any President since World War II. Last month, that figure slipped from 90% to 82%, its biggest drop so far, though it has since recovered to 87%. But we can regain that momentum. We need a sustained public outcry, a willingness to read the news with a keener eye and some consideration about the shape of our media landscape. Most of all, we need to figure out where we stand together and what it is that makes us all Americans despite everything that sets us apart. That kind of insight was on full display during South Korea\u2019s demonstrations. Confronted with rank corruption, Koreans responded with dignity. How bad would things have to get for us to hit 4% approval with Trump, whose overall approval rating currently stands at 40%, according to Gallup. We may never see the Republican Party abandon him at such rates, no matter how bad things get. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. NRA TV host Dana Loesch seems to thrive on dog whistle controversy. Case in point: in a recent segment of her internet show \u201cRelentless,\u201d she castigated the British cartoon series \u201cThomas & Friends,\u201d featuring Thomas the Tank Engine, for seeking to bring \u201cgender balance\u201d and \u201cethnic diversity\u201d to the show. The special focus of her ire? A tank character named Nia from Kenya who was introduced as part of the program\u2019s effort to internationalize and diversify its characters. Horrible as that may seem to Loesch, she capped her critique by displaying a doctored picture of Thomas and two of his friends in KKK hoods riding on track seen to be burning in the background. Loesch considers the program \u201ccreepy.\u201d But next to the image of children cartoon characters in Klan outfits \u2013 well, readers and viewers can draw their own conclusions about what constitutes \u201ccreepy.\u201d But what does Loesch\u2019s grotesque distortion of a children\u2019s cartoon have to do with gun rights? Nothing, according to the laws of common sense. But in the era of President Donald Trump, everything. This tale begins with the NRA\u2019s early and fulsome endorsement of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign \u2013 even before he had officially captured the nomination. That political move was significant for two reasons: first, the gun rights group has normally not made political endorsements so early in an election cycle; second, the NRA was taking a political risk because of the unorthodox nature of Trump\u2019s campaign. But the NRA\u2019s gamble hit the jackpot. Trump won the nomination, and the presidency. Cooper presses Loesch on Trump's gun comments The NRA has taken its culture war cues from Trump, especially through NRA TV where, according to Time magazine, \u201cits segments are anti-Black Lives Matter, pro-cop, anti-media and pro-Trump.\u201d Add to that list that it\u2019s against Hollywood liberals and so-called coastal liberal elites, all Trump targets. The point is that it\u2019s not just guns the NRA is defending, but its way of life, its identity. If these messaging themes are good enough for the President, then why not for the NRA? Absent a demonic figure in the White House like Barack Obama or Bill Clinton, here is a new focus to gin up fear, anger, and gun sales. Despite the fact that a decade earlier, Trump had supported gun measures like the assault weapons ban and longer gun waiting periods, his conversion to NRA dogma was thorough and unwavering. But more than that, Trump\u2019s core constituencies coincided closely with that of the NRA \u2013 especially older white males from rural areas, who are also highly likely to be gun owners. It was a natural fit. Multiple studies have found that fears of \u201cracial and global status threat,\u201d as political scientist Diana Mutz puts it, and fear of change in an increasingly multiethnic nation were core forces driving much of the Trump vote. This does not mean that all or even most Trump voters were racists, but that race-based fear and anxiety was nevertheless an important animating force explaining Trump\u2019s victory. NRA core supporters share many of the same beliefs. Finally, a cop is convicted for recklessly shooting an unarmed teenager One need look no further than Trump\u2019s obsessive condemnation of NFL players, mostly African-Americans, who chose to kneel before the start of games to protest unjust police shootings of African-Americans, to understand Trump\u2019s dog whistle race baiting. When Nike recently featured Colin Kaepernick, who led the kneeling movement, in an advertisement, Trump used it as a convenient symbol to rally his base and divert attention from the parade of scandals and missteps that have characterized his administration. Even if one questions whether there was racial animus embedded in Trump\u2019s verbal attacks on NFL players, Trump\u2019s shocking defense of neo-Nazi protestors who demonstrated in Charlottesville in 2017 as including \u201csome very fine people\u201d \u2013 and which neo-Nazis were the \u201cfine people,\u201d I wonder? \u2013 has to lead us to realize that Trump has carved out a safe space for virulent racists. Admittedly, there is nothing the NRA would like more than to cultivate gun ownership and use among segments of the population that have shown little or substantially less interest in guns, including women, African-Americans, Latinos, and the LGBT community. To date, however, efforts to increase gun ownership among these groups don\u2019t seem to be yielding many gains. Surely the angry, dark, and relentlessly apocalyptic messaging that is the steady rhetorical diet of the NRA is not disposed to broaden the NRA\u2019s appeal, which goes double for its recent Trumpish foray into the culture wars. CNN anchor to NRA spokeswoman: How dare you The NRA\u2019s reaction, or lack of reaction, to recent shootings involving police and African-Americans certainly hasn\u2019t helped it broaden its base. Consider the case of Philando Castile, a 32-year-old African-American pulled over by police outside of St. Paul, Minnesota, in 2016. When the officer asked for the man\u2019s license and registration, Castile told the officer that he had a firearm (and was a licensed gun owner). In the car was Castile\u2019s girlfriend and young daughter. After yelling at the man to not pull out his gun, and after Castile replied that he was not, within seconds the officer fired 7 shots, killing Castile. (The officer was acquitted of manslaughter, but was removed from the force.) For its part, the NRA has been quick to defend, in a highly public way both with words and legal assistance, civilians who were, in its view, properly exercising their gun rights \u2013 even if authorities said otherwise. From Bernhard Goetz, the 1980s \u201csubway vigilante\u201d who shot four African-American youths he said were harassing him, to its fierce advocacy for expanded \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws that give special legal protections to people who kill others who feel threatened in public places, the NRA has been unstinting in extolling civilian gun use.  Yet in the Castile case, and despite the fact that the man wound up dead for simply exercising his so-called \u201cgun rights,\u201d they were silent. In the culture wars debate the NRA wants to have, criticism of police, even when they mistakenly use deadly force against African-Americans, is a bridge too far \u2013 even if invoking the KKK isn\u2019t.",

It is full of sports (Australian rules football), photos of cute kids, shocking crime stories, celebrity gossip, and, if an election is in the offing, relentless right-wing political polemics. Oh, and cartoons. It also does cartoons. Australia is the nicest racist country you will ever see. It is racist in a blithe, jokey kind of way, where nobody is supposed to take anything too seriously, and nobody is too aware of historical or cultural contexts. There is racial violence in Australia\u2019s history, but not a lot of it, compared with many other countries, and it\u2019s not very recent. The racism you get in Australia is mostly of the blindness to privilege variety, where a person may make fun of another for their distinguishing characteristics without realizing that doing so is far more comfortable from within the demographic majority. The Herald-Sun is full of such casual racism, along with a lot of other idiocies. I read it almost every day, starting with the always entertaining letters to the editor, where the ignorant and misinformed produce tyrannical and byzantine solutions to the world\u2019s problems, as well as complaining about gas prices. Also it does have excellent football coverage. Its Serena Williams cartoon, published Monday, was shocking in its harkening back to century-old Jim Crow-style imagery, but not exactly surprising, because there is something like that in the Herald-Sun all the time. It was also unsurprising in how the newspaper and its cartoonist, Mark Knight, subsequently defended the cartoon, which was simply to deny it has anything to do with race. (The Herald-Sun used a favorite phrase: \u201cThe world has gone mad.\u201d) Because, in Australia, if no offense is intended, none can be taken. EDITORIAL | The world has officially gone mad when a celebrated cartoonist is condemned by the social media hordes for depicting a famous sports star throwing an unedifying tantrum.https://t.co/cqIAoq9DLq There\u2019s little doubt that Knight grossly exaggerated the nose and lips of Williams for the same reason he exaggerates the physical characteristics of most of his cartoons\u2019 subjects: They are caricatures, and, as such, he targets differences and explodes them. But he must have been aware of, and deliberately ignored, the historical echoes of his cartoon \u2013 the exaggerated lips and nose reminiscent of racist depictions of black people in the United States during Jim Crow. On base logic, he was right to do so: It created only a minor stir domestically, and, I\u2019m sure, more laughs than gasps among its core readership. To be clear, the Herald-Sun isn\u2019t a niche publication: It is the biggest-selling newspaper in Melbourne, Australia\u2019s most liberal city. It finds an audience because, in typical Murdoch media fashion, it delivers cheap, bright, digestible dollops of news and entertainment, mostly the latter, to people without a lot of free time. Even during election season, when the hand of Murdoch can be seen banging ever more stridently on the political drums, you will always find at least one snap of plucky kids or an interesting dog. Australians often find it unclear why such things as Knight\u2019s cartoon are considered racist. Less than a decade ago, we couldn\u2019t understand why singer Harry Connick, Jr. was offended by a blackface performance during a TV show. A few years ago, my own daughter was given a golliwog doll. These things are intended as gentle humor, in good spirit, and expected to be taken that way. This will change\u2014slowly, much more slowly than in countries like the United States, with its vastly greater direct exposure to African peoples, culture and history. But probably not in the Herald-Sun.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. If, as Bob Woodward alleges and is being reported in early extracts of his tell-all book about the Trump White House, President Trump called his Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an Alabama resident, a \u201cdumb Southerner,\u201d he may have finally done something he has long been unable to do: unite black and white Southerners. We may not agree politically; actually, we disagree passionately on most issues. We don\u2019t see eye-to-eye on the issue of race and Confederate monuments and memorials. Even our views of Jesus and Christianity are diverging and increasingly at odds. But boy are we tired of having to contend with the stereotype that we are slow and unintelligent. This side of the n-word, \u201cdumb Southerner\u201d is maybe the most impactful epithet you can throw at someone in the South. \u201cMentally retarded,\u201d another term Trump reportedly used to describe Sessions, is also high on the list. Trump has since tweeted a denial of using either term. Calling Southerners some version of dumb is so effective that even Southerners do it to get under each other\u2019s skin. Bob Woodward book: Trump called Sessions 'mentally retarded' Residents of South Carolina rejoice by thanking God they aren\u2019t Mississippians, who often show up at the bottom of good rankings and the top of bad ones, with South Carolina usually one rung above. Alabamians are happy they have South Carolina to kick around. North Carolinians are proud to be home to the New South city Charlotte and the Research Triangle that includes high-profile universities, which makes it easier for the state to claim world-class status and deny that this stereotype applies to them, too. Such slurs pick at an open scab, that of school districts in the South repeatedly showing up at the bottom of educational lists and too high on lists about heart disease. It is a scab that is reopened every time an A-list Hollywood actor speaks in a distorted, haunting drawl to try to sound genuine when portraying down-on-their-luck, unsophisticated Southern-based characters on the big screen. It stings us all, black and white. We are tired of having to remind people that we don\u2019t \u201ctalk different\u201d any more than do Bostonians or Bronx residents, that the pace of the words that flow from our mouths is not indicative of the intellectual activity taking place inside our heads. That\u2019s why even Trump ally Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia, said \u201cI resent that\u201d when asked about Trump\u2019s use of the epithet. A version of the slur was used in 2000 by a high-profile South Carolina state senator, Arthur Ravenel, for whom one of the longest cable-stayed bridges in North America is named, because the National Association of Colored People initiated an economic boycott of South Carolina to protest the flying of the Confederate flag at the Statehouse. Ravenel caught heat for referring to the NAACP  as the National Association of Retarded People \u2013 then doubled down by apologizing to retarded people. He also later said he had mixed up his words because he was scheduled to meet with the SC Association for Retarded Citizens. Trump amps up attacks on Woodward after explosive book excerpts It was a way to put black Southerners in their place, to remind them that they would never be as good as white Southerners. Trump has turned even that racial divide on its head because he allegedly used the term to refer to a Trump-voting and supporting white evangelical Christian who served in the US Senate, was a captain in the US Army, received a law degree from the University of Alabama and is now the nation\u2019s top law enforcement official. If Trump thinks that about a white Southerner with such a long list of credentials, there\u2019s little reason to believe he doesn\u2019t think the same thing about many of the white Southerners who always show up at his rallies to passionately praise and cheer him. What\u2019s worse is that the slur comes courtesy of a fast-talking New Yorker who never showed any concern for white Southerners, rich or poor, before he ran for president. And yet, I suspect, while black and white Southerners will be united in our outrage about the slur, many white Southerners will stick with Trump. Just days after he announced his intentions to run for the presidency, I spent time reminding white members of the Tea Party in the Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, area that they had more in common with me, a black Southern native, than they did with Trump. Our parents and friends struggled to stay safe doing dangerous work at nearby factories and were struggling to find a new way forward as those factories were closing. We spent a lot of time praying for each other. We needed a better healthcare and more adequate educational system. We shopped, side-by-side, in Walmart and cashed our checks at local credit unions. We ate at the Southern-style buffet restaurants.  Trump knew nothing about any of that, I said. It didn\u2019t matter. They flocked to him anyway, led by men like Sessions, the first sitting US senator to endorse Trump. That\u2019s why though I empathize with Sessions, and others like him who have to endure unfair slurs from men like Trump, I likely won\u2019t be shedding too many tears. I\u2019ve been all cried out since the night of the 2016 presidential election.",

Operation Contain the President Hours into the latest twist in Trump\u2019s incredible saga of disruption and corruption, a writer at the Atlantic was warning of a \u201csoft coup,\u201d and social media was ablaze with speculation over the Times op-ed writer\u2019s identity. Little-used words in the piece \u2013 \u201clodestar\u201d was one \u2013 were being cited as forensic evidence, and a mistaken tweet describing the writer with a male pronoun was seized upon to eliminate half the population. Most amateur detectives, with no evidence to go on, seemed to be focused on chief of staff John Kelly and outgoing White House counsel Don McGahn. On Twitter, Vice President Mike Pence became a trending topic, as his proximity to power \u2013 he would succeed Trump should the President resign \u2013 made him one person who would obviously benefit from the perception that Trump couldn\u2019t handle the job and had to be replaced. Since his election, Trump\u2019s fear, to borrow Woodward\u2019s title, has been that he would be deemed illegitimate and somehow forced from office. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s election interference, and Team Trump\u2019s possible collaboration in that effort, has long stood as the most serious threat to the President. By calling Jeff Sessions a dumb Southerner, Trump has done the impossible That probe, and its offshoots, led to Trump fixer Michael Cohen\u2019s cooperation with prosecutors. If Trump saw this defection as betrayal, and he surely did, news that several insiders at the White House are actively working against him will only make Trump livid. Ill-tempered and erratic to begin with, a Trump energized by rage will be even more unstable and dangerous. If the op-ed writer didn\u2019t know this before sending the article to the Times, then he or she hasn\u2019t been paying close attention. Woodward reveals Trump as the King Baby of presidents People with the President\u2019s level of heedless narcissism don\u2019t back down. Instead, they double down \u2013 and in this case, doubling down could have awful consequences. If the author\u2019s intention was to bring Trump under control, he or she has taken a big gamble with the condition of the republic.  This gambit will only stop Trump if he is provoked into self-destructive action and his departure is hastened. This is the most likely outcome of this latest installment of this episodic nightmare, and the writer who has pushed us further along this course will deserve an ample share of the credit and the blame. An earlier version of this article incorrectly described President Trump\u2019s tweet. It was \u201cTREASON?\u201d, not \u201cTRAITOR?\u201d",

The views expressed in this commentary are hers. View more opinions on CNN. The ongoing investigation into President Donald Trump\u2019s conduct in the 2016 election is not just an inquiry into whether he or his associates committed crimes. It is a test of America\u2019s commitment to the basic principle that our justice system should treat every citizen equally. If the US Senate is serious about upholding that principle, it will delay Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation hearing until special counsel Robert Mueller has completed his investigation. If it does not, it risks tarnishing the Supreme Court and undermining the rule of law \u2013 blows from which our nation will not easily recover. Trump has repeatedly denounced the special counsel\u2019s investigation as a partisan \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d But the investigation\u2019s findings so far suggest otherwise. Two of Trump\u2019s former campaign aides and his first national security adviser have all pleaded guilty to federal crimes. The President\u2019s former campaign manager has been convicted of financial fraud. And federal prosecutors recently secured a guilty plea from Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who said he made illegal campaign finance payments at the direction of then-candidate Trump. To be sure, we don\u2019t yet know whether the President himself committed any crimes. But until the investigation is finished \u2013 and it must be allowed to finish \u2013 there exists a real possibility that some related issue, such as the President\u2019s obligation to obey a subpoena, will find its way before the nation\u2019s highest court. If that happens, the American people must be able to trust that each justice will vote according to the dictates of the law and the demands of the Constitution, not out of loyalty to Trump. The only way to ensure that trust is to refuse to consider any Supreme Court nominee put forth by this administration until the investigation is complete. Ordinary citizens don\u2019t get to appoint the judges that will hear their cases. The President should be treated no differently. Lilly Ledbetter: Brett Kavanaugh would be bad for women Despite the cloud of legal uncertainty shadowing the President, Senate Republicans are determined to proceed with Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearings. And they are doing so in the most irresponsible way, scrambling to complete the hearings before the National Archives can release even a small fraction of Kavanaugh\u2019s papers. To date, Kavanagh\u2019s opinions from the DC Circuit, all public, have been released, but the White House has withheld 100,000 pages of his record working in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. Contrary to Republicans\u2019 objections, these documents are extremely relevant, detailing his years of service in Bush\u2019s White House, years which Kavanaugh himself called the \u201cthe most interesting and formative\u201d of his pre-judicial career. By rushing confirmation hearings before Kavanaugh\u2019s full record can be thoroughly examined, the Senate leadership is abdicating its constitutional responsibility to advise and consent on a nominee who will shape American jurisprudence for a generation. Not all of Kavanaugh\u2019s record remains hidden from sight, of course. My colleagues at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund have spent months scrutinizing Kavanaugh\u2019s judicial opinions, writings and public statements, and they have documented their findings in an exhaustive report. What emerges is an intellectual portrait of a jurist committed to an ultra-conservative philosophy, one that grants the executive extraordinary power and threatens longstanding laws and precedents that protect civil rights in the United States. Why Kavanaugh needs to brush up on his Watergate history These are alarming beliefs, especially now. Kavanaugh has suggested that the President has unlimited power to remove executive branch officers, questioned the 1974 Supreme Court decision that forced Richard Nixon to release the Watergate tapes, and argued that a sitting president should be able to defer civil suits and criminal prosecutions until after he or she leaves office. These are troubling views from a judge who may well be called upon to decide whether a president (the President who appointed him, no less) can withhold evidence or fire a special counsel investigating his conduct. Kavanaugh seems just as unlikely to stand up to this administration\u2019s tireless assault on civil rights and racial justice. He has promoted the idea that the Constitution is colorblind, thus rejecting decades of Supreme Court precedent that helped to end legalized discrimination in the United States. He also upheld a voter ID law that the Justice Department deemed a threat to the votes of tens of thousands of minority citizens. Trump has refused to condemn violent white supremacists, and he has repeatedly made false allegations of widespread voter fraud, perpetuating a myth used to disenfranchise Americans of color. Placing Kavanaugh on the bench would lend judicial cover to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back a half-century of progress and hollow out the Fourteenth Amendment.  The nomination of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court represents a momentous juncture in our history. With his confirmation in the balance, the Senate has a chance to place country before party, to reaffirm certain principles in these uncertain times: that the public and their representatives have a right to carefully evaluate its judges; that all Americans deserve equal justice; that the United States is a nation of laws, not of men. These principles will be jeopardized if Kavanaugh is placed on the Supreme Court. That is a steep price, one that will be paid not only by us, but by generations to come. He should not get a hearing, and he should not be confirmed.",

This weekend, at the Detroit commemoration of Aretha Franklin, Al Sharpton hailed her as \u201cthe soundtrack to the Civil Rights movement.\u201d That movement had its very roots in too many funerals. At the 1955 funeral of fourteen-year-old Emmett Till, Till\u2019s grieving mother invited thousands of mourners to view his open casket \u2013 millions more had their eyes opened to the violence inflicted on the black body when Jet magazine published the photographs. But the Western tradition of the game-changer funeral goes back centuries, past Mark Antony inciting Romans to avenge the murder of Caesar, to the Ancient Greeks. The classical model for a funeral oration has always been that given by Pericles, an Athenian statesman, during Athens\u2019 wars with Sparta. Pericles oversaw the public funeral of soldiers killed at a pivotal point in the Peloponnesian War. He rallied support for the war with a reminder of the Athenian democratic virtues for which these soldiers had already chosen to sacrifice their lives. \u201cOur government does not copy our neighbors\u2019, but is an example to them. It is true that we are called a democracy. \u2026 Fix your eyes upon the greatness of Athens, until you become filled with the love of her; and then reflect that this supremacy was won by men who knew their duty and had the courage to do it.\u201d John McCain, commemorated on Saturday at the Washington National Cathedral, was fond of quoting lines from Pericles\u2019 oration. So perhaps it was on his mind as he laid the blueprint for his own funeral. Like Pericles, his friends chose to praise McCain for that which he would have wanted most to be praised: his commitment to the highest standards of American public life. Inevitably, minds turned to the figure who, McCain felt, embodied the corruption of that American democracy: President Donald Trump. As the British playwright Lucy Prebble tweeted during the funeral, \u201cit\u2019s rare for a funeral to have a nemesis.\u201d George W. Bush and Barack Obama: Consolers in chief President Barack Obama started his eulogy with a greeting to each of the other former Presidents and Vice Presidents present in the room: Bush, Clinton, Gore, and Cheney. Nothing made Trump\u2019s absence from the ceremony more conspicuous. The references to Trump continued, oblique, but clear. Obama lamented contemporary politics with a line that could be a summary of Trump\u2019s Twitter feed: \u201cSo much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty, trafficking in bombast and insult and phony controversies and manufactured outrage.\u201d Even George W. Bush, the most recent former Republican President, took a swipe at his co-partisan while praising McCain\u2019s lifelong opposition to \u201cbigots and swaggering despots.\u201d It was left to Meghan McCain, John McCain\u2019s daughter and seemingly his anointed political heir, to confront Trump directly. In a eulogy her father had requested she deliver, she remarked: \u201cThe America of John McCain has no need to be made great again, because America was always great.\u201d In another moment, she seemed to take aim at Trump\u2019s failure to serve in Vietnam. \u201cWe gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness \u2013 the real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who lived lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.\u201d Senator McCain was held for five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi, after he declined early release, refusing to leave behind those whose release should have preceded his own. The significance of lying in state Despite McCain\u2019s heroism, Trump notoriously mocked him during the 2016 election campaign. \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d said the now-President, who was exempted from the draft after a doctor diagnosed him with bone spurs. But McCain\u2019s funeral was not the only farewell to an American icon this weekend, nor the only funeral to an icon recently insulted by Donald Trump. The friends and family of Aretha Franklin gathered on Friday, not for a funeral but a homegoing \u2013 a service drenched deep in the traditions of African-American church and the civil rights movement. While McCain\u2019s funeral recalled Eurocentric classical traditions (Athenian democracy, after all, did not extend to women and slaves), Franklin\u2019s evoked the scores of civil rights funerals at which she had sung, or at which her father had preached. The singer Fantasia performed a mashup version of the gospel anthem \u201cTake My Hand, Precious Lord,\u201d which Franklin had performed at a memorial for Martin Luther King Jr., 50 years ago. In Detroit, there was clear anger toward President Trump \u2013 particularly after comments in which he claimed the icon had \u201cworked\u201d for him \u201con numerous occasions.\u201d Many noted that Franklin\u2019s long involvement in the black civil rights struggle should not have left her to be obituarized as entertainment for wealthy white men \u2013 especially a man who once took out ads in New York City\u2019s newspapers to demand the death penalty for the Central Park 5, five young black men later exonerated of rape, in the wake of their arrest. Early in the evening, Al Sharpton reclaimed her for his black-majority congregation, quipping at Trump that \u201cshe used to perform for you \u2013 she worked for us.\u201d Aretha Franklin's funeral fit for a queen The frustration finally bubbled over in a speech given by Georgetown Professor Michael Eric Dyson. After a crescendo of insults \u2013 \u201cyou doppelganger of deceit and deviance,\u201d Dyson declared: \u201cShe ain\u2019t work for you. She worked above you. She worked beyond you. Get your preposition right.\u201d But as with McCain\u2019s funeral, the call to political resistance was largely implicit. As befits a great artist, the moments that spoke most powerfully of Franklin\u2019s spirit were moments of poetry and song: Cicely Tyson repurposed Paul Laurence Dunbar\u2019s poem, \u201cWhen Malindy Sings;\u201d Pastor E. L. Branch quoted Longfellow: \u201c\u2018Dust thou art, to dust returnest\u2019 was not spoken of the soul.\u201d Where McCain\u2019s friends told stories of bipartisan camaraderie, Franklin\u2019s were clear about the Democrat sympathies in the audience. If McCain\u2019s service was bipartisan, Franklin\u2019s was explicitly Democratic. Regretting that \u201cwe\u201d lost Michigan by 11,000 votes in 2016, the Rev. Jesse Jackson lamented that the unregistered voters in black-majority Detroit could have swung the state. Rev. William Barber, who referred to Hillary Clinton as \u201cthe woman who won the popular vote for President,\u201d echoed his call for voter registration drives. Is it possible for the funeral of any great activist to reach across the aisle, and yet stake out a clear political legacy to its mourners? As McCain\u2019s funeral ended, journalist Dara Lind asked on Twitter: \u201cCan you have civility without chumminess?\u201d How Aretha's powerful sensuality paved the way At both funeral services this weekend, mourners tried to answer that question. Former Democratic Senator \u2013 now an Independent \u2013 Joe Lieberman talked of telling jokes with McCain on the balcony of hotels in Jerusalem. But Lieberman\u2019s break with his own Democratic party demonstrates neatly that it\u2019s hard to keep ties with one political tribe while frequently cutting deals in the center. Lieberman\u2019s pally anecdotes about McCain will not have wide outreach. Voters whose loyalties have been won by partisan promises are rarely keen on their representatives hobnobbing in international hotels with the opposition. When civility becomes chumminess, politics looks like the game of a clubbable elite. At Franklin\u2019s funeral, the same questions were expressed in the visible tension between politics of respectability and radicalism. A testament to Franklin\u2019s broad church of friends, on the podium we saw radicals (Louis Farrakhan, whose presence drew controversy due to lifelong accusations of anti-Semitism) next to black conservatives (Rev. Jasper Williams Jr., whose eulogy was criticized on Twitter when it placed heavy blame for African-American poverty on the black community itself. There were even swipes between those asked to commemorate Franklin. Barack and Michelle Obama sent a letter to be read on their behalf. Dyson, who has written widely on Obama\u2019s legacy as a biracial President, claimed in his speech: \u201cNow, negros scared to say they black. Scared to show up at a too black place. That\u2019s why some black folk ain\u2019t here today. They sending letters, they don\u2019t want to get up in this blackness.\u201d As at McCain\u2019s funeral, we were left to wonder: when is it a virtue to be divisive?  There was one further question hanging in the air this weekend. Where do we go from here? Could we ever see Obama, Dyson and Williams organizing in the same civil rights movement? A rallying cry for voter registration is at least a start. At McCain\u2019s commemoration, former Presidents from the GOP and the Democratic Party were able to give speeches touching on the same virtues of civility and political self-sacrifice. But on the frontlines of this November\u2019s election battles, the tone is still set by Donald Trump and his Twitter feed. To many American voters, the very bipartisanship of Saturday\u2019s gathering at the National Cathedral will testify to the herd mentality of a Washington elite. Pericles had an advantage. If we believe his biographer, the historian Thucydides, his listeners shared his definition of his nation\u2019s values. They just needed an eloquent reminder. The broken body of Emmett Till exposed an evil so explicit that its presence in America could no longer be denied. But it is not clear that the vast TV audiences for Aretha Franklin\u2019s homegoing are all on the same page about racial justice. Nor that the millions who watched John McCain\u2019s funeral share his vision for America. Meanwhile, to many voters elsewhere in America, unity looks like weakness.",

Fifty years ago, anti-war protesters swarmed the streets of Chicago during the Democratic National Convention to reject the Vietnam War, state violence, and injustice. In the process they turned the city into a veritable battleground over the fate of American democracy. \u201cThe whole world is watching!\u201d protesters chanted in response to police violence in August 1968. That one phrase encapsulated much of the radical social justice insurgency of not only that year but also the entire decade of the 1960s. As the nation mourned the April assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and June killing of New York senator and presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, thousands of radical activists came to Chicago to try and shame the Democratic Party into publicly adopting a peace plank that some hoped would lead  to an end to war. The college students, hippies, anti-war activists, and ordinary Americans who traveled to Chicago in the summer of 1968 were, however imperfect, patriots who spoke truth to power and paid the price in blood, arrests, and controversy. While journalists and historians at times point to Chicago as the site of the Democratic Party\u2019s defeat and Richard Nixon\u2019s subsequent victory in the November presidential election, something more important happened that the nation has yet to recover from. In Chicago the American Dream collided with brutal truths about war, violence, and corruption. How could the same nation that regarded itself as the freest nation on earth bomb one of the poorest in the name of democracy? Who were the elected officials who rationalized war as the only road toward peace? What role did citizens have in shaping a democracy that seemed to have lost its moral compass? My memories of '68: Chaos in black and white These remain some of the most enduring questions for our own age, where perpetual war, police brutality, and political malfeasance at the highest levels of government have evolved from the spectacular to the mundane.  In 1968 Chicago Mayor Richard Daley\u2019s deployment of tens of thousands of law enforcement officials to maintain security and order in the city was derided as \u201cGestapo tactics\u201d inside the Democratic Convention \u2013 even as a majority of Americans voiced approval of violence as a substitute for justice.  By 2014, the sight of police officers in military fatigues and tanks patrolling the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, became the cost of maintaining a hard peace in the absence of justice. Yet the imperfect idealism that animated protesters in Chicago endures. Forty years after police routed demonstrators advocating a more just society, thousands gathered in Grant Park to peacefully celebrate the election of the first black president in American history. President Barack Obama\u2019s two terms in the White House symbolized a measure of hope and progress for the generation who marched in 1968 and those who now stand on their shoulders. Their actions 50 years ago reflect the virtue and value of what Obama characterized as the most important title in our nation: citizen. These moms are seeking office to 'leave the casket open' Black Lives Matter protests have linked the entire criminal justice system to a system of structural racism and inequality that activists in 1968 confronted on the streets of Chicago. Police brutality and political corruption targeted by demonstrators 50 years ago continue to shape the very face of American democracy. The Justice Department under the Trump administration has steadily eroded criminal justice reforms enacted by Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch that were designed to reduce mass incarceration, eliminate sentencing inequality, and promote effective community policing across the nation \u2013 in an effort to ratchet down racial tensions after urban rebellions in Ferguson and Baltimore. The violent and illegal tactics the police used to crush dissent in Chicago have, in the ensuing half-century, been largely erased in favor of a narrative claiming that radical political extremism had taken over the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing. In fact, the protesters outside the halls of power in Chicago represented the mainstream of American political values in their ambition to end war, racism, poverty and violence both domestically and internationally. In photos: How 1968 changed America -- for better and worse Their demands turned into a generational conflict, pitting the Democratic Party establishment represented by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and Vice President Hubert Humphrey against an insurgent coalition of youthful activists determined to transform the nation even at any cost. Daley, a longtime ally of President Lyndon Johnson, deployed an army of police officers to maintain law and order in the city. Tom Hayden, the main author of the influential Port Huron Statement and a civil rights activist who had been beaten in Mississippi while working for civil rights, was perhaps the most well-known political radical in Chicago. Youth International Party (Yippies) leaders Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin attracted further publicity by practicing politics as performance art, including nominating a pig for president in an effort to remark on the absurdity of the American political system. Authorities were not amused. On Sunday, August 25, the day before the convention opened, Chicago police attacked demonstrators in Lincoln Park, setting the stage for a week of violent clashes. Daley forces targeted journalists covering events inside the convention and on the streets for violent retribution, including correspondents Dan Rather and Mike Wallace, who were assaulted by security guards inside the convention. Who is Martin Luther King Jr. to us, 50 years later? In contrast to the unified display showcased at the Republican National Convention in Miami earlier in the month, the Democrats were in chaos. The party\u2019s dreams of a Great Society faltered over an increasingly rancorous debate about the Vietnam War. Vietnam raised larger issues about the future of American democracy, especially around the themes of militarism, racism, and materialism that Dr. King had decried before his death and that Bobby Kennedy wrestled with during his short presidential campaign. Ironically, these issues all converged on Wednesday, August 28, the fifth anniversary of the 1963 March On Washington. That evening over 10,000 demonstrators gathered in Grant Park (later the site of Barack Obama\u2019s victory speech in November 2008) clashed with police officers who brutalized men, women and innocents as well as those engaged in violent acts. In response, protesters descended upon the Hilton Hotel, where DNC delegates were staying and television cameras and journalists were headquartered. Vice President Hubert Humphrey watched in despair as police assaulted protesters in clashes that spilled out onto the streets and drew innocent bystanders into a web of violence.  Chicago reminds us of the deep historical roots behind contemporary political divisions. The partisan rancor that marks contemporary American political culture remains rooted in the violently brutal conflicts on display there a half century ago. The internecine war for the soul of American democracy continues in our own time, as the rage and fear tapped almost 50 years apart by Richard Nixon and Donald Trump have continued to mesmerize successive generations of Americans. Social justice movements, from 1968 to our own time, remind us that the whole world is watching.",

Earlier this month, I attended the Unite the Right 2 rally in Washington, DC \u2013 a gathering of white nationalists to mark the anniversary of last year\u2019s horrific violence in Charlottesville. Afterward, as a dense blue string of thunderstorms rolled in from the south, drenching everything, I found myself thinking about a quote by the late David Foster Wallace: \u201cHow do you promote democracy when you know that a majority of people will, if given the chance, vote for an end to democratic voting?\u201d It was from Wallace\u2019s \u201cBorges on the Couch,\u201d an essay about, among other things, Argentinian politics under Juan Per\u00f3n, 20th-century populism, and the beguiling fragility of open societies. This is America in 2018. The United States is being led by someone who openly defends white supremacists. Who calls the free press \u201cthe enemy of the people.\u201d Who abuses the power of his office to attack and silence his critics. Already, his campaign machinery for the next presidential election is kicking into gear. We\u2019re about to come face-to-face with Wallace\u2019s complication: To support Trump and similar politicians could very well amount to casting a ballot in favor of dismantling the core electoral safeguards that allow such votes to be cast in the first place. The rally itself turned out to be a flop. In retrospect, the biggest controversy to emerge from the weekend of protests and counterprotests had to do with an event that took place two days before the rally was scheduled to begin. On August 10, NPR broadcast the edited segments of an interview between Jason Kessler, the event\u2019s 34-year-old organizer, and Morning Edition\u2019s Noel King. For nearly seven minutes, Kessler answered questions in a halting tone. \u201cI\u2019m trying to explain it to you and you\u2019re not listening,\u201d he replied when King called him out for claiming that his First Amendment rights had been suppressed (not a new tactic). Historian: Americans are right to wonder if the Great Experiment has failed From there he grew less coherent. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know anything about my rally,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going based on left-wing rumor mills.\u201d To which King responded: \u201cI\u2019m citing the National Park Service, sir.\u201d Eventually, Kessler fell into a rant on the biologic superiority of white men and women, arguing that it was \u201cjust a matter of science\u201d that \u201cHispanic people and black people\u201d ranked lower in intelligence. In conclusion, he lamented, \u201cThere\u2019s really no place where it\u2019s OK for me to speak.\u201d Almost immediately, across social media and in traditional venues, both NPR and King came under heavy criticism and sharp questioning for conducting and airing the interview in the first place. What might they have done to provide more context? How should the independent press responsibly report on individuals like Kessler without supplying equal weight to their racist, hate-filled perspectives? NPR said in a statement that interviewing people \u201cdoes not mean NPR is endorsing one view over another.\u201d On Twitter, King explained, \u201cI\u2019m a biracial woman\u2026 Morning Edition is a notably diverse team who thought long and hard before airing this.\u201d To be sure, these accusations and responses deserve attention. But considering our current political climate, in which outrage occludes so much else, it\u2019s also important to refocus the discussion back on Kessler for an entirely different reason: what his fascism portends for the rest of us. Aide with white nationalist ties has left WH Jason Kessler is not a victim. Instead, in his convoluted play for legitimacy, he openly threatens the rights of American citizens he believes inferior. To put it bluntly: Any individuals who advocate for white supremacy in the mainstream media \u2013 seeking, in the process, to pervert our longstanding, if flawed, presumption of a shared objective reality into a blatantly false equivalency \u2013 are openly and knowingly participating in the destruction of democracy itself. I know that sounds extreme, and fair enough. But let\u2019s not split hairs. The overthrow of participatory democracy has been the overt goal of white supremacy from the very start. As such, for anyone advocating that ideology, racism is as much a means as an end, since it\u2019s only when the inherent rights of minority citizens are completely revoked \u2013 to a degree more extreme than Jim Crow or even slavery \u2013 that America will finally become an autocratic government powerful enough to enforce the uncompromising purity these supremacists so desperately seek. Which brings us back to the controversy over the rally and the NPR interview. How should the rest of the Republic (the majority of American citizens\u2026hopefully), interpret and respond to far-right movements that, from the start, make no apologies about their intent to hijack the \u201cthe American idea,\u201d as David Foster Wallace described it? What we\u2019re talking about now is really just another version of the quote from Wallace\u2019s essay on Borges: that deep-seated contradiction that our slavery-condoning participatory democracy was intentionally founded upon, a gap between reality and idealism in which the necessary rationales for the Republic\u2019s beginning and end\u2014for its existence and destruction\u2014have, over the last two centuries, managed to simultaneously reside. It\u2019s something that Charles P. Pierce, reflecting on the anniversary of Charlottesville, summed up perfectly: \u201cI am so free that I insist that my freedom includes the freedom to deny you yours.\u201d With Trump in the White House, white nationalists aren't going anywhere In other words, we\u2019ve been living from the very start with the dread that a rally like Kessler\u2019s inherently evokes: a self-destruct button built into the dead center of the American steering wheel \u2013 at the exact spot we\u2019d all expected the horn to be \u2013 and with each passing moment the likelihood of us pressing it, whether intentionally or not, increases. The flaw, after all, is right there in the design. In the face of such odds, there are no easy answers, or even\u2014and this is a distinct possibility\u2014correct ones. Instead we\u2019re left with a delimiting set of choices, the revolutionary paradox that, as Adam Gopnik writes, \u201cyou have to restrain your own freedom of self-expression in order to recognize the liberty of someone else.\u201d In one of his last published essays \u2013 from 2007, just ten months before his death \u2013 Wallace would go on to write: \u201cAre some things still worth dying for? Is the American idea one such thing?\u2026Have we actually become so selfish and scared that we don\u2019t even want to consider whether some things trump safety? What kind of future does that augur?\u201d Last year, in response to the violence in Charlottesville, our 45th president used the tactic of false equivalency to compare Heather Heyer, the young woman murdered that weekend, to the sort of man who\u2019d killed her. \u201cSome good people on both sides,\u201d he famously asserted to reporters in Manhattan. \u201cI think there\u2019s blame on both sides.\u201d He was, as is his style, being racist. But like Kessler, he was also articulating a means to an end.  And now, as his standing worsens and the multiple investigations into his possible crimes accelerate, Donald Trump is running out of options. Can the American Idea survive the onslaught of racial demagoguery he\u2019s likely to unleash, in the coming weeks and months, as a last-ditch effort to rally together the worst among us and save himself? Whether we like it or not, Donald Trump is steering the country into the future. And as the rest of us watch on in disbelief, the odds that he\u2019ll somehow avert disaster and keep his wandering hands to himself grow slimmer and slimmer with each passing day.",

Standing outside in the rain near Lafayette Square, I waited Sunday to see white supremacists march in Washington, DC. Anxiety simmered under my skin as I lingered for a glimpse of the organizers who crowded Charlottesville, Virginia last August with tiki torches and hateful messages, and left the college town and the nation in chaos after their deadly protest to maintain Confederate monuments. In the nation\u2019s capital, police officers lined the street, red and blue lights flashed and clusters of counterprotesters gathered. I saw a group of white men dressed in black gathered nearby and watched them meet up with a comrade, a man who stood next to me carrying a protest sign that read \u201cgo back to the basement.\u201d Together, they chanted the same slogan and laughed about the meager number of white supremacists, less than 40, who showed up for the Unite the Right 2 rally to advocate for white civil rights. I overheard them joking that white nationalists and their ideas went underground, vanished, washed away with the rain \u2013 at least for the day. I didn\u2019t laugh. It wasn\u2019t funny. As a black woman, I couldn\u2019t find any humor in a second iteration, even a tiny one, of the rally that gave us some of the most sinister images of American racism in recent history. And I know that, just because white supremacists didn\u2019t show up in Washington in large numbers as they did in Charlottesville last year, that didn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve disappeared. In fact, white supremacist groups and racist acts of violence are on the rise. Hate is more visible. Moreover, racist rhetoric that consistently comes from the White House helps to create a climate of tolerance for racist ideas. Trump's attacks on LeBron fit a disturbing pattern Trump didn\u2019t cause the nation\u2019s racial problems, but his rhetoric and policies revive and recycle racial stereotypes. Just today, Trump tapped into the historically racist and antiquated tactic of dehumanizing black people by associating them with animals, and called Omarosa Manigault Newman, his long-time reality television collaborator and the only African-American to serve in a senior role in his White House, a \u201cdog.\u201d Trump often evokes the trope that black people are intellectually inferior. Earlier this month he said that two black men at the top of their careers, NBA star and philanthropist LeBron James and news anchor Don Lemon, are dumb. He referred to veteran Congresswoman Maxine Waters as \u201can extraordinarily low IQ person.\u201d Since the campaign trail, Trump has connected Mexicans to crime and demonized Islam, and since the election his politics and practices have kept people or color out of the country and detained them in dehumanizing ways. This constant othering of nonwhite people by the President of the United States taps into the same racist ideas that white supremacists hold and serves to mainstream bigoted ideologies that justify the oppression of people of color. Last year Trump even minimized the role white nationalists played in the violence in Charlottesville, saying there was \u201cblame on both sides\u201d and signaling a new era in mainstreaming white supremacy. I went to Lafayette Park because, despite everything, I still wanted to see this public display of bigotry for myself. The Unite the Right Rally 2 felt to me like an ugly chapter in history repeating itself. In 1925, thousands of Ku Klux Klan members marched through Washington with their faces exposed, wearing white robes and hoods. At the time the Klan\u2019s popularity and membership were high. White supremacist ideas were widely accepted. Their presence was normalized. But this year there was no tolerance for the presence of white supremacists in the nation\u2019s capital. Crowds of people showed up to resist white nationalists\u2019 vile ideas of hate with messages of equality and carried signs that read \u201cuproot white supremacy,\u201d \u201csolidarity trumps hate,\u201d \u201cI wish this were were fake news\u201d and \u201canother world is possible.\u201d It is a blessing that there were not hordes of white supremacists in Washington to potentially clash with hundreds of anti-racism protesters and repeat the violence of last year in Charlottesville. But no one should perceive the white nationalists\u2019 absence as a sign of their decline.  Since last year\u2019s deadly Charlottesville rally, white supremacists and candidates with ties to the alt-right have launched campaigns for public office. White nationalists are still moving to spread their message and gain power. Just because some of them took a Sunday off doesn\u2019t mean they clocked out for good.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. In normal circumstances, fathers safeguard sons. But with a peevish statement on Twitter this weekend, President Donald Trump undermined his son, Donald Trump Jr., and one of his own lawyers, saying that when the Trump presidential campaign team met with a Russian operative at Trump Tower in 2016, its purpose was \u201cto get information on an opponent.\u201d Trump added, that it all was \u201ctotally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!\u201d As with so many Trump tweets, a few words can reveal a host of serious problems. And indeed, if you are able to find a similar example of paternal aggression in real life or in mythology, you are an able scholar. Trump\u2019s tweet about the 2016 meeting reads like nothing so much as an exasperated father having to clean up the mess left by a bumbling offspring who \u2013 it turns out \u2013 is pretty bad at plying the family trade. More than anything else, that trade has been about managing \u2013 and massaging \u2013 the mythology of the Trump business:  We\u2019re rich! We\u2019re decisive! We\u2019re winners! And in this case Donald Jr. has failed utterly. The fact is, his father\u2019s statement may imperil him: Trump Jr. could face perjury charges if he is shown to have lied to a Congressional committee about his intentions for the meeting and particularly his understanding of who would be there. Trump urged not to tweet about 2016 meeting To review:  First Trump Jr. said he never met with Russians about the campaign. Then, after a 2017 New York Times article reported that he and others had met in 2016 with a Kremlin-tied lawyer (who later described herself as an \u201cinformant\u201d) at Trump Tower, he first released a statement that the discussion at the meeting had been primarily about a US adoption program that had been halted by Russia (this statement was a deception concocted aboard Air Force One by his father).Then he released emails that made plain he was actually drawn to the meeting by the promise of dirt on Hillary Clinton \u2013 a promise, he told investigators, that went unfulfilled. The deception over the meeting was compounded when Trump attorney Jay Sekulow stated publicly: \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved in the statement drafting at all, nor was the President.\u201d Now Sekulow says: \u201cI had bad information at that time and made a mistake in my statement. I\u2019ve talked about that before. That happens when you have cases like this.\u201d Though Sekulow tried to explain away the reversal \u2013 \u201cI had bad information\u201d \u2013 no qualified lawyer, especially one representing the President, would speak to the press without being sure of the facts. \u201cBad information\u201d can be fatal in a legal context, and if Sekulow disseminated a lie, he was either the President\u2019s dupe or his co-conspirator. After kneecapping Sekulow, Trump then went into his usual don\u2019t-blame-me position with his weekend tweet.   \u201cI did not know about it\u201d was a classic Trump effort to wriggle out of responsibility. It also signaled a definite shift in his response to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into the links between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russians who attacked the election process. What we know about the 2016 Trump Tower meeting For more than a year Trump\u2019s mantra has been \u201cno collusion.\u201d \u201cNo collusion\u201d occurred with the Russians who stole private emails for his opponents and facilitated their release to the public.  With Mueller closing in, the new defense seems to be: OK, maybe collusion, but that\u2019s not a crime and, besides, the man at the top knew nothing. So who did know?  The list begins with his son, Donald Jr., the one most imperiled by Mueller\u2019s team. Those emails released more than a year ago show Donald Jr. was eager to receive foreign help in the pursuit of his father\u2019s goal of the presidency.  \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say, I love it,\u201d he wrote in response to a foreigner\u2019s note about dirt on Hillary Clinton. No one should doubt that documents that might damage an opponent constitute a contribution with real value. As such, Donald Jr.\u2019s emails and his attendance at the Trump Tower meeting could put him in the middle of a criminal conspiracy. If he lied to Congressional investigators who questioned him on the matter, he might also be subject to charges of perjury. Others who attended the meeting, including the President\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and campaign manager Paul Manafort \u2013 the latter of whom is on trial for alleged financial crimes right now \u2013 and they face great peril, too. By insisting he knew nothing about such a dramatic scheme, Trump wants us to reject logic and everything we know about how he operates. Trump is a man who relishes gossip, inside information and the thrill of breaking the rules. Manipulation is the family business that Donald Jr. was groomed to practice.  And as sure as he breathes, he would have eagerly announced to his father that he was playing this game. Did Trump Tower meeting violate this law? Over many decades of public life, Trump has shown that for him, winning is all that matters and if victory requires a bit of distortion and immorality, so be it. This attitude, as he adopted false personas in the past to promote himself, and, during his presidency, displayed as he inflamed racial tensions and whipped others into a frenzy of hatred for the press, is the core of Trump\u2019s personality. He is so devoted to his winner\u2019s fa\u00e7ade that he refuses to take responsibility for anything that goes wrong. As candidate and now President, Trump has violated so many moral norms that the shadowy content of his character is well established. In apparently selling out his son, and exposing him to inevitable shame and possible prosecution, he has reached yet another new low. This is appalling but not a surprise, nor does it reflect a momentary lapse. It is a reflection of the President\u2019s truest self and we should expect to see more of the same.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. As we celebrate the 53rd anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, which vastly improved voter turnout, this country is at a crucial juncture in the centuries-long struggle to create, maintain, preserve, and ensure true equality of voting rights for members of minority populations. That we are still concerned about this well into the 21st century is incredible. That we, especially those of us who work to make voting readily accessible to all, are even more concerned than we were five years ago \u2013 when the Supreme Court gutted a key provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby v. Holder \u2013 is frightening. On August 6, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, which took critical action against literacy tests and poll taxes and provided for federal oversight of voter registration in places where less than 50% of the nonwhite population had not registered to vote. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders were present for the enactment of this legislation that gave African-American voters the legal means to challenge voting restrictions. Only 12 years ago, in 2006, a unanimous Senate and a nearly unanimous House of Representatives re-authorized Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the crucial provision that prevented jurisdictions with a history of discriminatory voting practices from implementing any changes in voting without federal preclearance. Voting Rights Act Fast Facts Nevertheless, a scant seven years later, a deeply divided Supreme Court handed down a decision that, in the words of Congressman John Lewis, \u201cput a dagger in the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\u201d Shelby County v. Holder overturned Section 5. This left Section 2 as the Voting Rights Act\u2019s sole remaining prohibition of racial discrimination in voting. But since January 20, 2017, the DOJ has not filed a single suit under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Of equal concern, today we have an administration partnering with those who have used the myth of voter fraud to further the passage of laws aimed at suppressing the votes of minority voters. Just recently, the President exhorted a Florida rally that \u201cthe time has come for voter identification,\u201d ignoring that 34 states \u2013 including Florida \u2013 require some form of voter identification. The President\u2019s fixation with the myth of millions of fraudulent votes manifested itself in the creation of the ill-conceived Presidential Commission on Election Integrity, run and peopled with the leading purveyors of the canard of voter fraud as a means to further voter suppressive laws. The early termination of the commission was one of the few bright spots in this administration\u2019s voting rights activities. Not surprisingly, documents produced last week in litigation brought against the commission by one of its members, Maine Secretary of State Matthew Dunlap, showed that the commission had no proof of widespread voter fraud. Justice Ginsburg: The 'liberal lion' we need right now Meanwhile, voting rights for minority groups have faced sustained assault. After Shelby, a myriad of discriminatory voting practices have been implemented both in jurisdictions previously covered by Section 5 and those that were not. Many of these practices are subtle and occur at the local level, allowing them to fly under the radar now that the advance notice protections of Section 5 are gone. These practices range from the consolidation of polling places to make it less convenient for minority voters to vote (black voters, nationally, wait twice as long as white voters to vote), to the curtailing of early voting hours that makes it more difficult for hourly-wage workers to vote, to the disproportionate purging of minority voters from voting lists under the pretext of \u201clist maintenance.\u201d Before and for three years after Shelby, the Department of Justice was at least an engaged partner in the fight for civil rights, and one with capacity and resources which civil rights organizations could not match. Times are different now. While the DOJ\u2019s more recent inactivity is troubling, its few recent affirmative steps in the voting rights arena during this period are more so. Since Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Department of Justice has reversed or retreated from prior positions in at least three significant voting rights matters, including two in which it abandoned claims of intentional discrimination. The DOJ\u2019s reversal of positions signals to lawmakers that there is a degree of tolerance for voting discrimination. It runs the risk of being perceived as a wink-of-the-eye to those who would push the limits of discriminatory tactics, and a cold shoulder to those vulnerable populations who have counted on the federal government to have their backs. Olympian: This is what it means to be an American What the President is really pushing for with his comments about voter identification and voter fraud are the sort of more stringent voter ID statutes that courts have found to be racially and ethnically discriminatory. Most of these statutes require photo IDs, less likely to be possessed by minority voters, and exclude those \u2013 like public employment and public university IDs \u2013 more likely to be possessed by minority voters. And what the President was also pushing was the discredited myth of voter fraud. Texas\u2019s voter ID law, for instance, has now been declared unlawfully discriminatory. In the 10 years leading up to the law\u2019s original passage, there were only two known instances of in-person voter fraud out of 20 million votes cast. Similarly, allegations of widespread noncitizen voting have been grossly overstated in the past, as the Ohio secretary of state\u2019s study of recent elections proved. The placement of any noncitizens on the rolls is usually the result not of intentional fraud, but of administrative error. The remedy to this is not restrictive requirements, such as proof of citizenship documentation, which impacts minority groups disproportionately, but rather better training and oversight of the administrative process.  The combination of the effective elimination of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the DOJ\u2019s actions and inaction, and the administration\u2019s touting the mantras of voter suppression presents a perfect storm not seen since the days preceding the enactment of the momentous civil rights legislation in the 1960s. As we observe the anniversary of the Voting Rights act, we must rededicate ourselves to a simple proposition: do everything possible to help people vote, not stop them from voting.",

He is the author of several books, most recently \u201cStokely: A Life.\u201d The views expressed here are his. Watch CNN\u2019s \u201cDistorting the Truth,\u201d about how a Russian government-linked group exploited the death of Philando Castile, on CNNgo. The news that Russian hackers, in the wake of the police shooting death of Philando Castile, sought to exploit increasing racial divisions in America through a social media campaign of disinformation should come as no surprise. Historically, both during and after the Cold War, the Russian state has tried to use America\u2019s tragic history of racial violence and segregation for its own political purposes. In some chapters of American history, the commingling of Russian state action and American racial politics has unfolded in the open, with the consequences fully obvious for all to see. In an era before Black Lives Matter, communists at times provided the most full-throated and unequivocal defense of black humanity even if this defense was at times used in service of international propaganda against the United States. So contemporary Russian trolls who set up a phony Facebook account \u2013 complete with a planned demonstration \u2013 in the aftermath of Philando Castile\u2019s 2016 death at the hands of a police officer in Saint Paul, Minnesota, entered this long and complex history. Where in the past the Soviet Union touted itself as a state free of racial discrimination and attracted tiny numbers of blacks like Paul Robeson to tour the country and at times live there, Russia\u2019s post-Cold War state of \u201cmanaged democracy\u201d offers no such illusions. Instead, the Russian project under President Vladimir Putin seeks to destabilize American democracy by turning the nation\u2019s inner demons against itself. Philando Castile's mom learns surprising news During the Great Depression era, the Soviet Union trumpeted naked displays of Jim Crow injustice as proof of the insincerity of American claims of freedom and democracy. The unjust imprisonment of nine African-American boys and young men in Scottsboro, Alabama, on the false charge of raping two white women on a train in 1931 became a major propaganda victory for the Communist Party (which also helped garner much needed legal, financial, and moral support for the innocent black defendants at a moment when mainstream civil rights groups looked the other way). During the height of the Cold War, Communist interest in black lives rested on a Janus-faced platform. On the one hand, genuinely sincere American Communists truly believed in Marxism as a vehicle for racial equality. White American Communists affirmed this belief to the point of (in some cases) risking injury or death by organizing interracial unions, crossing the color line in the North and South, and marrying African-Americans when it was illegal to do so. For these true believers, dismantling racism and white supremacy held the key to eradicating the political and economic horrors unleashed by global capitalism. Trump and Putin are meeting. What could possibly go wrong? On the other hand, Russian Communist officials, apparatchiks, and newspapers saw in America\u2019s unfolding racial crisis an opportunity to shield the Soviet Union from criticism of its own human rights violations, creeping authoritarianism, and barely concealed imperial ambitions. The Cold War that unfolded in the Second World War\u2019s aftermath is sometimes narrated as an ideological conflict between liberal democratic capitalism and Soviet-styled communism. President Ronald Reagan boiled it down to a battle between good and evil.  In truth, hearts and minds mattered as much as ideology, perhaps even more so during the unfurling age of African and Third World decolonization. The Truman-Eisenhower-Kennedy-Johnson administrations governed America during some of the Cold War\u2019s hottest years.  Over the course of these two decades, the United States developed its own sophisticated brand of racial propaganda to counter the real and sometime imagined narratives of the Soviets. The State Department, United States Information Agency, and a whole slew of federal agencies organized international trips, jazz tours, and publicized racial breakthroughs commonly referred to as \u201cNegro Firsts\u201d \u2013 to tout racial progress in America. At the same time, President Kennedy said this during a televised June 11, 1963 speech to the nation on race matters: \u201cToday, we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free\u2026 And when Americans are sent to Vietnam or West Berlin, we do not ask for whites only.\u201d On national television, amidst a roiling spring and summer of racial discontent that coincided with the centennial anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation, Kennedy admitted by implication that the completion of the American project of liberty, freedom, and democracy required racial justice for African-Americans. It remained so then, and though the landscape has changed, it remains incomplete today. And unlike other previous Russian propaganda or hacking targets like the 1984 Olympic Games (where the KGB sent forged racist letters in the name of the KKK to athletes from African and Asian nations), the Democratic National Committee, or the 2016 presidential elections, local grassroots groups and social media-driven activist networks lack the resources and infrastructure to anticipate being targeted in advance or respond in effective ways, if they ever even realize they\u2019ve been targeted. Rep. Gaetz: Russia did meddle in our elections Russian attempts to utilize social media to discredit, manipulate, or derail the Black Lives Matter movement underscores the vulnerability of domestic social justice movements that continue find themselves, as they have been in the past, under government surveillance, closely watched and at times harassed by law enforcement, scapegoated by far right and conservative opponents, and exploited by trolls seeking to undermine American democracy. The at times illegal harassment and surveillance of black activist groups by local and federal law enforcement also buttressed charges by the Soviet Union that racial discrimination continued to haunt American democracy. FBI informants famously infiltrated the Black Panthers in the 1960s, effectively crippling a group poised to become a major force in American society.  Major Panther leaders were arrested on trumped up charges, misled into attacking rival Black Power organizations, and in some instances, shot and killed at the hands of law enforcement officials given a virtual green light to assault the group by the FBI.  One informant provided the Chicago Police with precise information that resulted in the shocking death of charismatic Panther leader Fred Hampton in 1969. Russia's trying to toss us an apple of discord. We mustn't bite. So in the same manner that civil rights and Black Power groups from the 1960s faced illegal wiretapping, surveillance, and infiltration via the FBI\u2019s infamous COINTELPRO program aimed at domestic radicals, contemporary anti-racist activists are being targeted by Russian hackers in an effort to discredit their important work. And yet, for all the historical parallels, several sobering truths abound with warning signs for the future. The most glaringly obvious is the fact that Russian interference in the 2016 election may have tipped the balance in favor of President Trump, whose well-articulated racist views have gone a long way toward crippling America\u2019s reputation at home and abroad. Tellingly, Trump first made a name for himself by advocating the death penalty for defendants in the Central Park Five jogger trial, a case with bitter echoes of the Scottsboro Boys, complete with exonerations bestowed only after collective decades in prison.  America\u2019s collective inability to confront anti-black racism makes us especially vulnerable online to the very forces of external manipulation that cold warriors railed against in an earlier generation. Last, and most important, the path toward racial justice remains in front of us, just as it did during the Cold War era, waiting to be claimed as the beating heart of American democracy. A nation that invests in children over walls, that sees borders as opportunities for engagement rather than sites of separation, and that recognizes racial justice as a core American value can never be manipulated by external threats.",

Follow her at @KristenClarkeJD. The views expressed here are solely hers. This week\u2019s Supreme Court decision backing the purging of inactive Ohio voters from the rolls was devastating for those who care about ensuring access to democracy, but Justice Sonia Sotomayor\u2019s powerful dissent provided a silver lining. She shined a spotlight on the historical use of purge programs as a voter suppression tactic, charted a path forward, and sounded a call to action for groups concerned about protecting minority voting rights. This dissent is the latest in a series where she confronts the reality of discrimination and reveals the hypocrisy of ostensibly race-neutral government actions.  Though the Ohio decision was a huge setback in the short term, generations from now, historians may look back on Sotomayor\u2019s writings for their honest discussion of the political context for today\u2019s most critical civil rights battles \u2013 realities too often ignored by a majority of the justices. In an era of hotly contested races and razor thin margins, voter suppression tactics remain a primary tool used to disenfranchise minority voters, hobble vulnerable communities and obstruct fair election results. Voter purge programs are chief among the suppression tactics we see today. This week, the Supreme Court issued a ruling that stands as a monumental setback for those who are concerned about reigning in jurisdictions that too often undertake efforts to strip legitimately registered voters from the rolls. A 5-4 majority of the court upheld Ohio\u2019s voter purge program in a ruling in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute that some will interpret as a go-ahead to other states to suppress minority votes through purging of the registration rolls. Sotomayor\u2019s dissents consistently reflect deep comprehension of the grave threats to democracy that we see today and an awareness of the injustices still faced by minority communities. Supreme Court takes a giant step backward on voter rights As she has observed in prior cases, such as Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, concerning Michigan\u2019s ballot initiative on race-conscious admissions policies in higher education, it is simply not fair if the majority wins by \u201cstacking the political process against minority groups permanently, forcing the minority alone to surmount unique obstacles in pursuit of its goals.\u201d The Constitution, she continued, does not \u201cgive the majority free rein to erect selective barriers against racial minorities.\u201d Two years ago, she vividly demonstrated the perils faced by black and Hispanic youth in her dissent to the court\u2019s ruling, in Utah v. Strieff, that it was lawful for police to stop and search a car, even without reason, so long as they can later discover an outstanding warrant.  Sotomayor recognized that allowing for post hoc justification for warrantless searches would most harm persons of color.  \u201cFor generations,\u201d she wrote, \u201cblack and brown parents have given their children \u2018the talk,\u2019 instructing them to never run down the street; always keep your hands where they can be seen; do not even think of taking back to a stranger \u2013 all out of fear of how an officer with a gun will react.\u201d   But it is not simply that people of color were \u201cdisproportionate victims\u201d of police stops that impelled the justice.  She stated a simple, but over-arching truth: These actions \u201ccorrode all our civil liberties and threaten our lives.\u201d Similarly, in Husted, Sotomayor helped the public understand the gravity of the majority decision by underscoring that 10% of African-American voters in Cincinnati had been removed from the rolls under Ohio\u2019s scheme. As Sotomayor explained, Ohio\u2019s purge process had a disproportionate impact on people of color, low-income people, disabled people, the homeless and veterans. Sotomayor also emphasized that more vulnerable groups are less likely to vote and less likely to receive and return mail notices because of language-access problems, inflexible work schedules and lack of transportation. Ohio voting rights decision not a green light for reckless voter purges While a majority of the court turned a blind eye to these undisputed facts, Sotomayor insisted that these facts matter, especially in a case arising under the National Voter Registration Act. In fact, the Senate report that accompanied the NVRA\u2019s passage explained that the law was meant to protect \u201cpoor and illiterate voters from being caught in a purge system which will require them to needlessly re-register\u201d and from purge systems that have a \u201cdisparate impact on minority communities.\u201d Unfortunately, as Sotomayor concluded, these are precisely the effects Ohio\u2019s law has. Sotomayor understands that the pretext of voter fraud has been used for generations to justify voter suppression efforts. She aptly observed  Ohio\u2019s process as part of this long history of \u201c[c]oncerted state efforts to prevent minorities from voting.\u201d  This is not an over-statement.  One need not look back to the days of poll taxes and literacy tests and all-white primaries to find this history.  We see voting discrimination today in the form of restrictive voter identification requirements, discriminatory redistricting plans, cuts to early voting opportunities, burdensome documentary requirements for people seeking to register to vote, and purge programs put in place under the guise of efforts intended to \u201cclean up the rolls.\u201d  Sotomayor understands reality. Voter suppression is real, it is happening today, and it undermines our democracy. Which brings us full circle to the concluding paragraph of Sotomayor\u2019s dissent in Husted, both a jeremiad and a call to action.  The communities impacted by laws like Ohio\u2019s, she declared, \u201cshould not tolerate efforts to marginalize their influences in the political process,\u201d and their allies should not \u201cstand idly by.\u201d  We at the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, along with our sister organizations, will pick up the gauntlet Sotomayor has laid down.  We have fought voter purge programs before and will continue using every tool at our disposal in the courts and legislatures to ensure that the myopic Ohio decision does not become the top of a slippery slope toward broader and even more suppressive laws.  We will work with states to safeguard and confirm a voter\u2019s right to remain on the rolls.  We will empower communities to identify and report unlawful voter purge efforts or voter suppression schemes in their communities. We will help educate our communities as to the steps they can and must take to register and stay on the rolls. Sotomayor\u2019s words will echo in our ears as we move forward: Americans must be \u201ceven more proactive and vigilant in holding their states accountable and working to dismantle the obstacles they face in exercising the fundamental right to vote.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Van Jones is the host of the \u201cThe Van Jones Show\u201d and a CNN political commentator. He is the co-founder of #cut50, a national, bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. At the beginning of the Trump era, observers feared that any chance for a bipartisan reform of our criminal justice system was dead. But to the surprise of many, a hope for some positive change \u2013 however modest \u2013 remains. Therefore, leaders on both sides of the aisle need to continue working together to win whatever progress is still possible. The millions of human beings who remain trapped within our dysfunctional and discriminatory justice system deserve our best efforts, even now. Before Trump\u2019s election, hopes for real change were rising \u2013 and with good reason. For the better part of a decade, both conservatives and liberals have increasingly embraced reforms to America\u2019s prison and criminal justice systems. Democrats have long bemoaned the racial discrepancies that ballooned alongside the exponential rise in our prison population. Yet few recognized the GOP has actually taken the lead in passing smart justice policies that both reduced incarceration and increased public safety. For example, then-Gov. Rick Perry closed prisons in Texas, saved upward of $3 billion and saw crime rates decline. Nathan Deal of Georgia has made criminal justice reform a pillar of his two-term governorship. Gov. John Kasich supported justice reform in Ohio, as did South Carolina\u2019s Nikki Haley. Other Republican governors such as Matt Bevin of Kentucky and Mary Fallin of Oklahoma have also made substantial progress in recent years. Kushner's effort to sway Trump on prison reform is smart In fact, at the 2016 Republican and Democratic conventions, both political parties adopted language in their platforms calling for reform of our prison and criminal justice systems \u2013 for the first time in either party\u2019s history. But Donald Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, election and early actions alarmed many criminal justice reformers. Most damaging have been his appointment of Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Sessions\u2019 swift rollback of Obama-era reform policies and the harmful rhetoric that has often stigmatized immigrants and people of color as criminals. Partially as a result, the nationwide momentum to fix our justice system has begun to stall, even at the state and local levels. We have already begun to see some efforts to roll back recent criminal justice victories in Louisiana, Alaska and even California. Advocates have soldiered on, but hope has been fading. That\u2019s why I took heart when Jared Kushner \u2013 whose father served time in a federal prison \u2013 began to prioritize prison reform as one of his policy priorities at the Office of American Innovation. There seems to be a tug of war inside the Trump administration, with Kushner representing the more modern, reform-minded GOP approach. This year, Kushner\u2019s impact has been felt \u2013 and noticed. In January, Trump hosted a public listening session on criminal justice reform. In his State of the Union address, Trump included a line that spoke to \u201csecond chances\u201d and redemption for people coming home from prison. Trump declared April \u201cSecond Chances Month\u201d in continuation of a legacy President Barack Obama began in 2010. Most significantly, Trump recently issued an executive order to create the Federal Interagency Council on Crime Prevention and Improving Reentry \u2013 to align federal government resources toward helping those returning home from prison to reintegrate successfully. Trump designates April 'Second Chance Month' for people with criminal records Support has also grown within the White House for a bipartisan bill that would increase prison programming, expand compassionate release and provide incentives for individuals in federal prison to transform their lives. That bill, called the Prison Reform and Redemption Act, was co-authored by New York Democrat Hakeem Jeffries and Georgia Republican Doug Collins. They are joined by 16 members of Congress from both parties, who are among the most knowledgeable and respected when it comes to legislating issues concerning our criminal justice and prison systems. There now seems to be critical mass to fast-track the bill for hearings and an eventual vote. The first committee hearing could come as early as next week. The initial proposal, which has been improved, has both defenders and detractors. 'Who is Meek Mill and why do we want to free him?' Someone, somewhere, is in dire need of this article In fact, a group of progressive organizations have opposed reforms that do not take a more comprehensive approach, including sentencing reform. They fear that if Congress passes a weak measure this session, it will have little motivation to continue to pursue other urgently needed reforms for many more years to come. Even Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, a recent convert to criminal justice reform, has called for a bolder, more comprehensive bill. Fortunately, there may be a middle path between supporting today\u2019s inadequate proposal \u2013 and getting nothing done at all. After all, even under the Obama administration, progress in this area was exceedingly difficult. Yes, it is true that Obama was the first US President to visit a federal prison and sit with men inside. He led a historic clemency effort that freed nearly 2,000 people who had been languishing in federal prison for drug-related offenses. And he issued nearly a dozen executive orders to address various aspects of our prison and criminal justice system. But even Obama was unable to get a comprehensive piece of criminal justice legislation through Congress. There was a bill on the table, and advocates (including #cut50) even helped convince House Speaker Paul Ryan to agree to put that bill up for a vote. But it ultimately never made it to the floor of either the House or the Senate. Unfortunately, the current administration is hostile to a broad overhaul. Enemies of broad reform such as Sessions and others have successfully exerted political pressure to quash more ambitious proposals. But they have not shut down every pathway forward. There is still some room for progress. My big heartache \u2013 on this topic and so many others \u2013 is how much common ground there is when you get people talking \u2013 and yet how little we actually do about it. Taking a small but meaningful step together now could allow us to take more steps together later. Furthermore, with improvements including the following, the Prison Reform and Redemption Act could become a worthy step forward: \u2022 Meaningful incentives that allow people either to shorten their prison terms or serve the remainder of their sentence in home confinement;\u2022 Expanded eligibility so that anybody coming home from prison one day would have an opportunity to benefit from those incentives;\u2022 Protections for women in federal prison who have gender-specific needs that have gone unaddressed for too long;\u2022 Other common-sense modifications that have bipartisan support. The Dream Corps\u2019 #cut50 initiative, which I helped to create, has been at the table working to strengthen the bill. With these improvements, the Prison Reform and Redemption Act could represent real progress \u2013 even in the age of Trump. And these baby steps could actually smooth the path and whet the appetite for other smart changes, down the road.  That\u2019s why I intend to join other progressive leaders in fighting to strengthen the proposal, in hopes that we can come up with something that advocates across the board can support. I do not know if these negotiations will turn out positively or if, ultimately, the legislative proposal will yield the results we seek. But I do know that in the names of the millions of people behind bars right now, all of us have a responsibility to roll up our sleeves, work hard and find out.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Kelly Dittmar is an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Rutgers-Camden, a scholar at the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) at Rutgers-New Brunswick, and project director at Gender Watch 2018 \u2013 a project of the Barbara Lee Family Foundation and CAWP. The views expressed in this commentary are solely the author\u2019s. Progress is not inevitable. And it is rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 complete. For women in American politics, each point of progress serves as a reminder of the progress we have yet to make toward equitable power and presence in government. Monday\u2019s swearing in of Cindy Hyde-Smith as the first woman in Congress from Mississippi is a perfect illustration of these points. One hundred and one years after the first woman, Jeannette Rankin, entered Congress, Mississippi is sending a woman to Washington, DC, for the first time. A milestone worth celebrating? Sure. But 101 years is a long time to wait, and in some states, the wait will be been even longer: constituents in Vermont are still waiting to see a woman in their congressional delegation. Electing or appointing one woman to Congress also does not ensure that more will come after her, at least not quickly, or even that she\u2019ll stay in Congress. In Mississippi, multiple men have already lined up to compete against Hyde-Smith in this fall\u2019s election for a full term in the Senate. Even with her ascension to the Senate, women make up just 19.8% of Congress, according to the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) at Rutgers. A decade ago, women were 16.4% of all members of Congress. Progress? Yes, but far from rapid and definitely incomplete. Having more women in Congress spells progress on multiple fronts \u2013 more equal representation being only one. Research has shown that the results-oriented approach of women in Congress has made them more effective than their male counterparts in bringing more money to their home districts, sponsoring or co-sponsoring more bills, and \u2013 at least among minority party congresswomen  \u2013 moving legislation forward through the legislative process. And greater diversity of voices, including women\u2019s voices, enriches debate and helps Congress to better reflect the breadth of experiences and perspectives of those it serves. And yet currently, according to the CAWP, 11 states have no women representing them in Congress. For the first time in 44 years, Maryland \u2013 a state that elected its first female member of Congress in her own right in 1972 \u2013 sent an all-male delegation to Congress in 2017. As some tout this week that just one state has yet to send a woman to Congress, much coverage will overlook the fact that 30 states have never sent a woman of color to Congress and that 33 states currently have no women of color in their congressional delegations. More specifically, black women have represented just 16 states in Congress and Asian-American women have served in only 6 states\u2019 congressional delegations, according to CAWP. Never has a Native American woman served in Congress (though this year \u2013 when at least four indigenous women are running for the US House \u2013 may change that). 'I hadn't yet learned I was less valuable than a man' Just 13 Latinas from 6 states have served in Congress since 1989, when the first Latina was elected to Congress. Remembering this historical context makes it far less surprising that Texas is poised to elect its first Latina (or Latinas) to Congress in 2018. That point of progress \u2013 one widely covered in media after Texas\u2019 primary last month \u2013 is cause for celebration, but also serves as a reminder of the work we have left to do to see a Congress that reflects the full diversity of those it represents. Research that I have conducted with my CAWP colleagues at Rutgers demonstrates that women\u2019s congressional representation matters in ways that go beyond the numbers. Our interviews with 83 of the women who served in the 114th Congress revealed that, at a time characterized by polarization and gridlock, women members perceive themselves as more results-oriented than their male colleagues, more likely to emphasize achievement over ego, and more concerned with achieving policy outcomes rather than receiving publicity or credit. Congresswomen who spoke with us also said they see themselves as bringing distinctive perspectives to the work they do by placing issues related to women\u2019s lives on the congressional agenda and being a voice for the voiceless in the halls of Congress. But women\u2019s distinctive perspectives are not rooted in gender alone. Truly improving the representativeness of Congress requires increasing not just the number of women in Congress, but the diversity of women\u2019s experiences brought to bear on agenda-setting and decision-making. As Senator Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, who became the first Asian-American woman elected to the US Senate in 2013, told us, \u201cSeeing people of different backgrounds and ethnicities and interacting with them, I think that you find some commonalities, but you also maybe begin to appreciate the diversity in our country. And when you appreciate that, it makes for a much more expansive thinking.\u201d It also makes for more inclusive and informed policymaking.  This brings us back to the numbers. One of the most common refrains from the 83 congresswomen we interviewed was that they wanted to see more women join their ranks. Like me, many women across America and in Congress will celebrate the welcome addition of another woman to the US Senate today. At the same time, congresswomen, scholars, and practitioners concerned about gender inequality are acutely aware that progress in representation for women in Congress has been slow, is far from complete, and does not happen without work. Placing Mississippi\u2019s milestone in context might help to motivate more of that work. I hope it does, because, when it comes to gender and racial diversity, Congress remains a work in progress.",

She is the author of the forthcoming book \u201cKeep Marching: How Every Woman Can Take Action and Change Our World.\u201d The views expressed here are solely hers. Cynthia was at an event for her advertising firm when she noticed that the vast majority of employees in the room were women. Somewhat surprised, she asked her boss why. Instead of lauding the value of women in the workplace, he responded, \u201cbecause I can pay them less.\u201d \u201cI was 23 and shocked,\u201d Cynthia told me. \u201cI hadn\u2019t yet learned I was less valuable than a man.\u201d No woman should be made to feel this way \u2013 and certainly no woman should be paid less for her time and effort. But Cynthia\u2019s experience isn\u2019t an anomaly. Countless  women are paid less, discriminated against and overlooked every day. Take Lynne, a nurse, who said, \u201cIn one of my nursing jobs, my pay was $17 per hour, while a male nurse with the same job, less experience and less education was paid $25 per hour.\u201d Or Kate, an executive, who wrote, \u201cI was agency director of a small nonprofit making around $30,000 a year. When I left, the board hired an inexperienced man, paying him double what they had been paying me.\u201d At MomsRising, a nonprofit that supports policies to improve economic security, we regularly hear from women like Cynthia, Lynne and Kate, who write in about their experiences with unequal pay. Many women discover pay discrimination by accident and fear retaliation for speaking up inside their workplaces. And yet many are now demanding fair pay policies from their state legislators and members of Congress \u2013 and a powerful movement is growing stronger and more effective each day. How to make the wage gap an injustice of the past Despite the fact that women make up nearly half of the workforce and receive more college degrees than men, they earn significantly less. Today, on average, women earn just 80 cents to a man\u2019s dollar, with Latinas earning only 54 cents, black women only 63 cents and mothers only 71 cents. No, those aren\u2019t typos \u2013 those stats are less than a year old, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center. However, as women raise their voices \u2013 and as many more run for public office \u2013 it\u2019s important to remember that this isn\u2019t just a moral or ethical fight. It\u2019s also an economic one. Studies show corporations make more profits with more women in leadership and have a higher performance with diverse teams. And keep in mind that three-quarters of mothers are now breadwinners for their families, so when moms make less, then more women and children fall into poverty. And this is not a small number of impacted people: Nearly a quarter of children are now living in poverty in our nation. Families making less also spend less, which impacts our consumer-driven economy. In fact, if women had pay parity, studies show our national GDP would increase by 3%. Equal pay movement has these lessons to learn Given the magnitude of the negative impacts of unequal pay, it\u2019s not surprising that women are rising up in increasing numbers to fix our broken systems. For instance, at MomsRising, our volunteer growth rate tripled since the last presidential election, and the number of unique MomsRising supporters taking action jumped 79% year-over-year. Women are speaking out for equal pay measures, along with other economic security, health care and anti-discrimination policies, with increasing urgency and frequency. Women are writing letters to leaders, making calls, meeting with legislators, starting petitions, sharing their stories, gathering together and speaking out. And our advocacy is making a difference. Just a couple of weeks ago, Washington state passed the Equal Pay Opportunity Act, which advanced paycheck transparency, addressing gendered job tracking and more.  New Jersey followed by passing one of the strongest equal pay bills in the nation \u2013 and Rhode Island is poised to advance strong equal pay legislation this week. Over thirty additional states are considering equal pay legislation this year.  Corporate momentum for change is growing, too, as businesses realize pay parity isn\u2019t just the right thing to do \u2013 it\u2019s the economically smart thing to do, since women are the majority of their customers. At a recent shareholders meeting, Starbucks announced its commitment to 100% gender and racial pay equity and shared tips for other corporations to reach pay parity, too. Other businesses are getting on board, too. For Equal Pay Day, more than 30 independent coffee shops and small businesses partnered with MomsRising and the Main Street Alliance to serve custom coffee sleeves and napkins featuring statistics, facts, and ways to take action for equal pay. This is just the beginning. Our power is growing each day \u2013 and not a moment too soon. It\u2019s time for us to double down on rising up and to commit to #KeepMarching until each and every one of us finally has pay parity.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Rosa Prince is an author and journalist who writes about US and UK politics. She is the author of the book \u201cComrade Corbyn.\u201d The opinions in this article belong to the author. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK\u2019s opposition Labour Party, has an anti-Semitism problem \u2013 and so now does the rest of the United Kingdom. Long before his election as Labour leader, Corbyn had been viewed with suspicion by some British voters \u2013 both inside and outside his party. Back then, it didn\u2019t seem to matter much. Corbyn was an obscure, if long-serving, backbencher in the House of Commons, never trusted with ministerial office by the Labour prime ministers he served in nothing except name and devoted to an eclectic range of anti-establishment, largely left-wing and anti-capitalist causes. The UK's biggest left-wing party is mired in an anti-Semitism crisis With his unexpected elevation to the Labour Party\u2019s leadership in 2015, however, those interests came into sharper focus. And to many British Jews \u2013 and non-Jews \u2013 a number appeared unpalatable. There were the questionable associations with Holocaust deniers and anti-Zionists; self-proclaimed \u201cfriendships\u201d with representatives from Hamas and Hezbollah; his stress on inclusive dialogue over the Israel/Palestinian conflict while only ever speaking to one side. In the intervening 2\u00bd years, the question of whether Corbyn and the Labour Party he leads contains strands of anti-Semitism has bubbled below the surface of British politics, occasionally bursting to the surface in wildly malevolent eruptions. We are currently in the midst of one such eruption. The latest trigger: the unearthing of Corbyn\u2019s disapproval, expressed on social media in 2012, of the painting-over of a mural depicting a crude caricature of Jews and his tone-deaf response to the resulting outcry. This is only the latest in a series of incidents which, at the very least, have left Corbyn open to charges of tolerating anti-Semitism and anti-Semites. When I was researching my biography of Corbyn, a then-member of his leadership campaign confided that aides had repeatedly pleaded with him to address the concerns of Jewish community leaders who were already expressing alarm at the prospect of Corbyn taking charge of a major British political party. The candidate was, I was told, utterly uninterested, seeing, as he often does, any implied criticism as hostility and therefore an unwarranted smear. This was I think the last interview I conducted before returning home to New York, where I still live. Watching Labour\u2019s Jewish crisis unfold from the city with the largest Jewish population in the world after Tel Aviv provides an interesting perspective. To say that to play fast and loose with anti-Semitism would be a disqualifier for political office in the United States is an understatement. Even Donald Trump, who makes no bones offending entire racial communities, has in the face of accusations of anti-Semitism resisted doubling down in the manner he does on so many other issues. To do so would be political suicide. Until recently, the same was true of the UK, too. And, in my opinion, it is a direct result of Corbyn\u2019s leadership that it is not.  At the outset, many Labour moderates assumed Corbyn\u2019s victory marked a temporary aberration. It would soon be back to business as usual, a resumption of the party\u2019s historic beliefs in a mixed economy and the Atlantic alliance \u2013 including a proud tradition of opposition to anti-Semitism in all its forms. Instead, Corbyn has grown stronger through his time in office, attracting first hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic new members who have bestowed him with an almost cultlike status, and, more latterly at last year\u2019s general election in which the Labour leader once again proved the critics wrong, the support of millions of ordinary British voters. All found a new appeal in what had hitherto seemed old-fashioned allures: full-blooded socialism, nationalization, anti-globalization. Sadly, some also seem to have been attracted by the permission they felt \u2013 rightly or wrongly \u2013 Corbyn offered them to view first Zionists and ultimately Jews more generally as both oppressors and class enemies. The result is the unlikely events we witness today, when, more than 60 years after the Holocaust, a mainstream British politician can be accused of \u201cdeliberately baiting\u201d Jews without it significantly affecting either his electoral standing or position as party leader. And that is the most troubling aspect of the crisis the Labour Party now finds itself in.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Richard Barton is a doctoral student in government at Cornell University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. March for Our Lives and other demonstrations that have students at the forefront protesting gun violence are showing the nation a new, formidable political force. These young people are eloquently and passionately demanding meaningful gun reforms, and developing the organizational capacity and resources required to effect real change. The best way for them to use their growing political power is to advocate for the recruitment, training, funding and campaigning of Republican primary challengers who want to run on a pro-gun control platform. A recent CNN poll shows that Republican voters are starting to pull away from the GOP\u2019s traditional stance on guns. This indicates that many Republicans are willing to support new candidates. Moreover, some of these Republicans have the talent and ambition to run for elected office. They just need encouragement and support. Although many may believe that voting against all Republicans will get the nation closer to enacting gun control measures, Republicans \u2013 not all or even most but a sizable minority \u2013 are actually needed to do so. Students prepare to 'march for their lives' The Republican Party controls each branch of government. Even if Democrats win back control of the House and Senate in the November midterms \u2013 and that is a big if \u2013 they will still have to work with a Republican President and get at least 60 votes in the Senate. If Democrats do win back Congress and enact meaningful gun regulations, these reforms will be fleeting if the GOP simply repeals them once they regain power. And regardless of federal policy, state laws will continue to play a major role, and Republicans have unprecedented control of state governments. Swift, meaningful and durable reform is only possible if gun control advocates can alter the electoral calculation for Republican politicians. To understand how students can help do this, we need to put our finger on the exact political problem. Why is the GOP so steadfast in its opposition to reasonable gun regulations? How the NRA went crazy The National Rifle Association notoriously provides campaign contributions to the Republican Party, but donations are not the real source of the gun lobby\u2019s influence. The NRA largely controls the GOP on gun policy by mobilizing its members in Republican primary elections. The NRA closely monitors and grades legislators, and shares this information with members. If a Republican lawmaker supports gun control reforms \u2013 or even wavers in opposition \u2013 the NRA can send out an email that mobilizes mass opposition in the next primary. Imagine yourself as a typical Republican legislator under these political conditions. You invested a great deal of your own money and time to run for office and you really want to win re-election. You sincerely want to protect the Second Amendment, but in private you also recognize the need for some of the gun reforms staunchly opposed by the NRA. When it comes down to it, you know that voting for stricter gun laws will prompt a fiercely competitive primary election that can quickly snuff out your political ambitions. And you can be equally confident that no primary challenger will attack you for being too conservative on gun policy. Gun reform advocates need to change this electoral calculation. And they can by threatening incumbents though the nomination process. This has happened before in the Democratic Party. Why I'm marching on Saturday ... in a wheelchair By the 1960s, a powerful alliance of unions and civil rights organizations reshaped the Democratic Party, from the bottom up, and made racial liberalism a core party commitment. However, during the 1970s, activists opposed to school integration policies weakened this commitment by supporting primary challengers. Anti-busing activists empowered House candidates to run competitive challenges against Democratic incumbents in states as diverse as Massachusetts, Michigan, Kentucky and Texas. These activists were diligent and persistent. For example, Rep. Louise Day Hicks, a Massachusetts Democrat, entered office on the anti-busing wave in 1970, but was challenged two years later by another-movement backed candidate, who criticized the congresswoman for being insufficiently committed to the anti-busing cause. Most of these movement candidates did not beat their incumbent opponent, but the threat was real, and the message was clear. The anti-busing movement neutralized powerful pro-integration forces in the party, and altered the electoral calculation for Democrats in Congress. Some congressional Democrats remained deeply committed to civil rights, but many others, including a young Joe Biden, abandoned earlier positions and supported a series of bills that tied the federal government\u2019s hand in enforcing integration policies. 7,000 pairs of shoes placed on Capitol lawn A similar effort can move the Republican Party to the center on gun policy. The gun control movement \u2013 catalyzed by the students from Parkland, Florida \u2013 should channel their energy and resources to play this supportive role for Republican office-seekers. This can include founding an organization that recruits and trains candidates, similar to Emily\u2019s List, which recruits and trains women, and forming a political action committee to spend money on their behalf. By recruiting, training and supporting sympathetic Republicans, gun reform advocates can neutralize the power of the NRA. Since legislators pay close attention to potential threats long before a primary election, mobilization influences legislative behavior almost immediately. Even if the pro-gun control Republicans can\u2019t win many primaries, their presence in the races is enough to make a difference. By recruiting and training candidates to run for the 2020 elections, and demonstrating the ability to fund and mobilize support for them, Republican legislators will defect well before their next primary.  Gun control activists across the ideological spectrum should provide financial and organizational support to pro-gun control conservatives if they hope to achieve real change. This approach can pull the Republican Party back toward the center on gun policy and produce meaningful and durable reforms that may save many thousands of lives. Right now, students have the power to make this happen.",

Follow her on Twitter: @ruthbenghiat. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Italy\u2019s elections may have ended in a political deadlock \u2013 no one party or alliance gained the 40% necessary to have an absolute Parliamentary majority \u2013 but the projected results of the vote signal that sweeping changes are on the horizon, changes that don\u2019t bode well for liberal democracy. The governing center-left Democratic Party received just 19% of Italians\u2019 votes (a historic low) while anti-EU, populist and far-right parties like the Five Star Movement and the rabidly anti-immigrant League did very well (32% and 17.5%, respectively). That former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia party (14%) are now seen as moderate shows how far the country that had Western Europe\u2019s most robust political left for a century has shifted to the right. Italy's Five Star Movement gains momentum As with other countries that have started down this anti-liberal path \u2013 including the US \u2013 economic anxiety appears to have been a major factor. Shockingly, a third of Italy\u2019s youth are unemployed \u2013 nearly twice the EU average \u2013 and there is high public debt, two indexes of a sluggish economy. But the country\u2019s economy has actually improved under five years of Democratic Party leadership: industrial productivity is up 4.9% and banks are more stable. Yet many did not see how this directly benefited the average person, and the Democrats had no plan that competed with the universal basic income and subsidy schemes that Five Star and Forza Italia floated (without saying how they would fund them). It\u2019s telling that the south of Italy, which traditionally has among the highest unemployment in the nation, voted overwhelmingly for the Five Star movement. Yet perceptions matter as much as realities in populist politics. Economics was only part of the reason Italians made Five Star the biggest single victor of this election. Can anything save Italy from a return to fascism? Founded in 2009 by the former comic Beppe Grillo and internet entrepreneur Gianroberto Casaleggio, Five Star\u2019s eclectic mix of support for environmentalism, Euroskepticism, Internet-based direct democracy and government transparency seemed fresh and appealing, as did the idea that they would refuse to ally with anyone else to get to power. This was a protest vote against establishment parties seen to lack a vision for Italy\u2019s future. That purist isolationism will be the first of Five Star\u2019s principles to be sacrificed if they want to hold power. Five Star will probably govern together with a right-center coalition that includes the League and Forza Italia. Whether or not the Democrats are included in the mix, those worried about rising right-wing violence in Italy won\u2019t feel better any time soon. The other big winner of this election is the League\u2019s head, Matteo Salvini, who is the best advertisement for why racial anxieties mattered as much as economic ones in this election. Every non-center left candidate talked about what\u2019d they do to the 500,000-600,000 immigrants that in the last five years have arrived in Italy (a front line of the migrant crisis due to its abundant coastlines and proximity to North Africa.) In Italy's election, migration is a key issue Berlusconi says he\u2019ll deport them, and send soldiers into the streets to help the police. Salvini upped the ante, saying that Italy needs a \u201cmass cleansing, street by street, neighborhood by neighborhood.\u201d Both Berlusconi and Salvini highlighted the recent gruesome case of a Nigerian immigrant, who killed and dismembered a young Italian woman as paradigmatic of criminality they say is threatening Italy, while failing to condemn the drive-by shooting of six Africans in Macerata by a right-wing extremist, Luca Traini, who explicitly said he was taking revenge. Salvini has been tireless in spouting anti-immigrant rhetoric over the past two years. He\u2019s called for segregated buses \u201cfor the Milanese\u201d and for \u201ccontrolled ethnic cleansing\u201d of immigrants. In true populist fashion, his campaign materials billed him as the arbiter of a revolution of common sense. More jobs, more safety for our children, fewer immigrants around, lower taxes \u2013 all of these promises have paid off for Salvini.  It is unfortunate that this dangerous individual is already being glamorized in the press as Italy\u2019s newest political star and a charismatic substitute for the 81-year-old Berlusconi. I can already see Salvini being positioned as Europe\u2019s \u201cbad boy\u201d of politics due to his pierced ear (who cares?) and \u201ccomplicated love life\u201d (a series of high-profile romantic relationships). Yet violence of the type he\u2019s preaching is never acceptable. Will he and his current girlfriend, a model and television presenter, clean up the mess of the victims of his mass cleansing? Not likely. It\u2019s worth noting that Salvini, like the Five Star politicians, admires Vladimir Putin, and loves to be photographed with the stars of the international right, from Hungarian President Viktor Orb\u00e1n to Marine Le Pen, head of the right-wing Front National in France, and our own President, Donald Trump. Whatever the new government\u2019s final composition, this vote shows that Italy, birthplace of the original fascist movement founded by Benito Mussolini, has decided to privilege its rightist rather than leftist roots and identity.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Billy Graham was the most significant American preacher of the post-war years, excepting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. In fact, the two men were linked. In 1957, Graham asked King to join him for a 16-week revival in New York \u2013 a testament to Graham\u2019s commitment to racial equality. The two men quarreled over the Vietnam War \u2013 because Graham was, at heart, an old-fashioned conservative \u2013 but Graham bailed King out of jail when he was arrested while campaigning against segregation in Georgia. Graham\u2019s life is a rebuke to the idea that evangelicalism and politics don\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t mix. He became almost part of the unwritten constitution of American politics: a counselor to presidents, Democrat and Republican, and for many Protestants a moral anchor in a fast-changing century. Raised on a dairy farm near Charlotte, North Carolina, Graham dedicated his life to Christ when he was just 16. After World War II he became a full-time evangelist. An innovator in technology and theatrics, he spoke to large crowds with such eloquence and passion that he became a kind of star among Protestants. In 1953, he met Hollywood\u2019s Ronald Reagan at a benefit for retired actors and was impressed when Reagan persuaded another preacher there that movies were not the instrument of the devil. The fact that Graham met and knew men before they became president speaks to the cultural power he enjoyed: Influential people queued up to meet him. He was up there with Elvis Presley. Billy Graham's 1991 interview on retiring His impact upon American society is illustrated with a story from 50 years ago, recounted in W. Terry Whalin\u2019s 2014 biography, \u201cBilly Graham: A Biography of America\u2019s Greatest Evangelist.\u201d In 1966, Graham started a new mission based around screenings of a movie he\u2019d made. Graham insisted that screenings not be segregated. When the film came to rural Georgia, his organization struggled to find anyone willing to host it \u2013 until a young farmer stepped forward by the name of Jimmy Carter. Carter had been born again that very year. Ten years later this progressive Christian would win the presidency, an election victory that put evangelicalism into the Oval Office. Managing these kinds of relationships could be tricky: Graham would acknowledge the risk of compromising his own mission, which is why he didn\u2019t endorse Reagan in 1980 \u2013 although he had been very close to Richard Nixon and vouched personally for Nixon\u2019s morality and Christianity. When Graham finally read the Watergate transcripts, it was humiliating. Indeed, tapes released later of his 1972 conversations with Nixon would reveal Graham\u2019s own prejudices against Jews. He apologized in 2002.  Nevertheless, he transcended the Nixon years to become a bipartisan confessor to presidents. He was there at the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, counseling Hillary Clinton, who later said he helped her get through it. Graham\u2019s advice was that Bill Clinton should quit politics after the presidency and go into preaching, because he had the necessary skills, and let his talented wife run the country instead. Graham\u2019s death means a loss of continuity in American life. For decades he was a rational meeting point between faith and politics, a man who transcended parties to provide moral leadership. It was important that president after president could pick up the phone to the same man who would listen and advise with patience. He leaves behind a country that has always been divided \u2013 as the politics of his own time proves \u2013 but feels increasingly incapable of crossing those lines of disagreement.",

For a few hours starting next weekend, black America will exhale, something it has not done since the Republican Party chose as its presidential nominee a man who rose to national political prominence on open bigotry and 58% of white voters made him President. For a few hours, it will be a veritable black American holiday, a kind of revival in the middle of Black History Month and the second year of the Donald Trump era. For a few hours, all shades of black people, African and African-American, will be able to see themselves become the center of the most influential image-making industry on the planet. Slavery and racism will be neither soft-pedaled nor portrayed as the totality of the black experience. \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d scheduled for wide release next Friday, could therefore not have been better timed. Had Marvel decided to launch this superhero franchise during the Obama era, it would have still resonated, but not like this. The cast is full of all stars. The title character is played by Chadwick Boseman, who has portrayed the likes of Jackie Robinson, James Brown and Thurgood Marshall. Michael B. Jordan of \u201cThe Wire,\u201d \u201cCreed\u201d and \u201cFantastic Four\u201d stars as the movies primary antagonist. Academy Award winners Forest Whitaker and Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Academy Award nominees Angela Bassett and Daniel Kaluuya, and the Emmy award-winning star of NBC\u2019s critically-acclaimed \u201cThis is Us\u201d, Sterling K. Brown, are prominently featured in \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d Samuel L. Jackson has a point The title character has had an interesting evolution. He\u2019s already a cultural crossover success. He was introduced in 2016 in Marvel\u2019s well-received \u201cAvengers: Civil War\u201d in 2016, where he appeared alongside other superheroes, such as \u201cIron Man,\u201d \u201cSpiderman\u201d and \u201cCaptain America.\u201d But Black Twitter, and beyond, had been champing at the bit for him to not only leave the comic book pages and reach the silver screen, but to become the central focus of a film. And it\u2019s happening at the perfect time. When Barack Obama was in office, black America, as proud as it was to see black excellence in the White House, was still processing just what it meant to have the first black president show up during our lifetimes \u2013 and we are in some ways still processing. It was hard to balance the pride of his accomplishments \u2013 helping steer the country away from a potential depression; securing health reform (something no president before him could accomplish) getting Osama bin Laden; and saving the domestic auto industry \u2013 with bleaker realities that included a stubborn inequality, a controversial drone war that may have caused as much harm as it prevented, and racial imbalances that barely budged. Barack Obama is rightly praised and scrutinized. He\u2019s human and was charged with making the best of the bad choices every president is faced with. He represented the best of us on the biggest stage and succeeded against enormous odds and did it with honor and class. To have him replaced by Donald Trump, a man who spent five years arguing that the nation\u2019s first black president wasn\u2019t fully American, was nearly as deflating as Obama\u2019s election was inspiring. Angelique Kidjo: What Jimi Hendrix and Nelson Mandela taught me about racism To watch white supremacists gleefully embrace the president who followed the nation\u2019s first black president, get energized by him and feel supported by him, has been depressing. And all we can do is keep screaming about that 21st century horror and register to vote and write and create art and resist and educate and steel ourselves, knowing that every day we get up in the morning, Trump will still be president, and on some days, he will still be engaging in the kind of bigoted rhetoric that helped him win. I\u2019m not sure the rest of America understands the weight of that reality as experienced by black America. It feels like daily punishment for the sin of having felt overjoyed that black excellence was chosen in 2008, and again in 2012, to lead all Americans. That\u2019s where we are, and that\u2019s why seeing black excellence unapologetically take center stage again \u2013 if only for two hours and 15 minutes \u2013 on the big screen means so much. It\u2019s a let-your-hair-down and scream-at-the-screen if you want to moment. It\u2019s like going home, one in which the media can\u2019t keep distorting who you are or ignore you or decide your brand of excellence isn\u2019t quite good enough. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is being hailed an Oscar-quality blockbuster and has already broken presale records. It\u2019s not sneaking up on and pleasantly surprising us like \u201cGet Out.\u201d Its reach makes it bigger than \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d Its early success all but guarantees there will be more like it. That\u2019s why for weeks, I\u2019ve been getting calls from friends wanting to make sure we sell out entire theaters. I turned down an invitation to one such gathering planned for next Friday in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, because I\u2019m scheduled to be out of town \u2013 then learned others had already planned something similar where I would be, in Davidson, North Carolina.  We all know it\u2019s a fictional movie about fictional characters less familiar to many of us than Spiderman and Superman. We know that once the lights come on, the challenges we faced before the first scene will be there at the end of the credits. We know there will still be much work to do in real life. For a few hours, though, we\u2019ll have had a respite from the storm.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Peniel Joseph is the Barbara Jordan Chair in Ethics and Political Values and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently \u201cStokely: A Life.\u201d The views expressed here are his. Fifty years ago this month, a presidential commission released perhaps the most explosive government report of the 1960s. Its main finding: Racial violence that proliferated in major American cities in that era was rooted in the failure of political institutions to recognize the humanity of black citizens rather than the supposedly pathological behavior of ghetto residents. As we observe Black History Month, it\u2019s particularly important to recall how the findings of the presidentially appointed Kerner Commission rocked the nation, becoming a best-seller that combined passionate advocacy with principled social scientific inquiry to trace the roots of violence often characterized as \u201clong hot summers\u201d of racial and civil discontent. Its meticulous inquiry into the roots of urban poverty, police brutality and racial violence illuminated a toxic racial environment that would grow worse in the aftermath of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination barely a month after its official publication. The commission\u2019s sensitivity to the hopes and dreams of black folk trapped in segregated ghettos stood on the broad shoulders of civil rights activists such as King, even as the conditions patiently revealed the political environment that inspired black power activism and produced radical activist groups such as the Black Panthers. 10 quotes from 1968 report on race that resonate today Headed by Illinois Gov. Otto Kerner and stacked with leading political, civil rights and policy experts, the Kerner Commission report unveiled the relationship between institutions of American democracy and structures of racial, economic and cultural segregation that turned predominantly black ghettos stretching from Los Angeles to Harlem into what was effectively another country. Patterns of racial unrest and violence that gripped American cities squarely at the feet of the nation\u2019s political institutions were revealed. \u201cOur nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white \u2013 separate and unequal,\u201d the report declared. \u201cIt is time to adopt a strategy for action that will produce quick and visible progress,\u201d the report said, warning that it was past time for the nation to \u201cmake good the promises of American democracy for all citizens\u201d and with that laid down a political and moral gauntlet that would frame national discussion for the rest of the year. The report\u2019s empathy for black life scandalized many in mainstream politics, erecting a seemingly permanent demarcation between conservative law-and-order advocates who decried it as justifying lawlessness and political activists of various stripes, most notably King, who embraced the findings as incontrovertible proof of a message they and their forebears had articulated since Reconstruction. Voters of color won't be fooled by Trump on black jobless rate Ironically, the findings put President Lyndon B. Johnson in a political bind. Perhaps no other American President had done more to aid the cause of racial justice, nor felt more unappreciated. Johnson faced an increasingly difficult re-election campaign. He was criticized on the left by anti-war and black power activists, who accused him of effectively abandoning the ambitious plans for a Great Society on a distant battlefield in Vietnam. It was a position most eloquently outlined by King, who was at one time Johnson\u2019s staunchest ally in the cause of racial justice. Conservatives attacked the President as soft on crime, a closeted socialist whose war on poverty only emboldened black militants, while encouraging riots and mayhem. Richard Nixon, vying for the Republican nomination for president, seized upon the report for blaming the victims of violence rather than the \u201cperpetrators.\u201d Johnson remained silent in the face of the report, although the White House leaked his disappointment over the commission\u2019s failure to point out the progress that had been made under his administration in civil rights. Politically hurt by the report\u2019s national implications that his administration had not done enough to ensure racial and economic justice despite its best intentions, Johnson refused to meet with the bipartisan commission he appointed to great fanfare the previous summer. In stark terms, the report outlined a vicious cycle wherein the more blacks exhibited unapologetic anger and oppression over poverty, racism and violence, the more American society responded with increased police and punishment policies that exacerbated the situation without beginning to approach the root causes of urban violence. Frigid Baltimore city schools: Racism we haven't confronted Anticipating the Black Lives Matter movement\u2019s call for sweeping criminal justice reform, the Kerner Commission called for community policing and training for law enforcement.  More expansively, the report advocated for billions of dollars in new resources promoting jobs, education and health care to be directed toward urban centers and high poverty communities. Scores of interviews with rioters lifted the veil behind the depictions of looting and violence that became hallmarks of the era, finding the average rioter to be employed, educated and simmering with rage over institutional denial of decent housing, police brutality and lack of opportunity. The most controversial aspect of the report proved to be its bold declaration that white racism produced black poverty and violence in the ghetto. While nearly 60% of blacks agreed with the report\u2019s indictment of white racism, more than 50% of whites rejected this assertion. Trayvon's dad: We haven't made enough progress The 700-plus-page tome proved to be the \u201cwokest\u201d document ever produced by the federal government on race matters. But law and order proved to be a more popularly enduring theme for politicians, pundits and the vast majority of American voters than a report condemning white racism, indicting longstanding democratic institutions and admitting that the civil rights revolution had merely scratched the surface of the kind of radical change required to promote racial and economic justice. The report turned out to be the tip of rather sizable iceberg in 1968, a blood-soaked year marked by political assassinations, racial uprisings and domestic and international rebellions.  The President\u2019s National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorder remains a historical and intellectual jewel of the era, the artifact of a generation that, despite its immense flaws and inequalities, proved courageous enough to identify squarely the tortured relationship between race and democracy while outlining concrete demands and solutions for a way forward. Despite the failure of political leaders and American citizens to follow through on the report\u2019s unapologetic commitment to black equality, it remains one of the most important historical and political documents ever produced. The document anticipated urban decline and pointed out the conditions that have allowed a system of mass incarceration to flourish nationally since its publication. The 2016 reissue of the report, along with historian Julian Zelizer\u2019s riveting introduction, should be required reading for all Americans interested in understanding the historical and policy roots of contemporary discussions of race. It offered decisive judgment in the midst of national political and civic struggles and touched off a debate over race and democracy that continues to this day, absent the lucidly analytical and profoundly American sentiments conveyed by a report that asked the nation to proclaim once and for all that black lives matter.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Issac Bailey is an interim member of The Charlotte Observer editorial board and the 2016 James K. Batten Professor of Public Policy at Davidson College. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own. Justin Fairfax, the first black person elected to statewide office in Virginia in a generation, recently did what most black people in the South have been doing for decades: quietly, peacefully protesting the region\u2019s long embrace of white supremacy. Earlier this week, Fairfax momentarily handed off his duties as presiding officer of the Virginia Senate so as not to participate when a state senator stood to speak in honor of Confederate Gen. Thomas J. \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, a ritual so routine that Democrats and Republicans have been doing it annually without batting an eye. They were doing it again, despite the white supremacist march in Charlottesville last August, where a young woman was killed and others wounded when a car plowed into a throng of counterprotesters. They were doing it even after the strong show of force during the most recent election in Alabama, in which voters of color came out in full force to register their disgust about the blatant bigotry accepted by President Donald Trump and many of those who support him. Fairfax\u2019s act was so subtle, many observers didn\u2019t even notice. That reminds me of what Greg Hembree, a white state legislator in South Carolina, said when word began spreading that people wanted the Confederate flag taken off Statehouse grounds in the wake of the massacre committed in a black church by Dylann Roof. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that hasn\u2019t been an issue for the three years I\u2019ve been (in the South Carolina Senate),\u201d he said in June of 2015. Hembree didn\u2019t know the flying of the Confederate flag had long been \u2013 and always would be \u2013 a sore spot for many black residents, because he had seen no loud protests in the years before the killing of nine black people during Bible study. Black residents make those kinds of messy and difficult calculations every day. It\u2019s why I never considered shopping at a nursery that flew the Confederate flag and vowed to never spend a dime in a North Myrtle Beach restaurant called \u201cTar Baby\u2019s.\u201d Our protests are often subtle. Should the US ban Confederate monuments? It\u2019s long been a dilemma of black people in the South. If you protest and let your anger be known, you risk being called purveyors of hate or \u201coutside agitators,\u201d and being accused of hardening racial divisions or stirring the pot. If you swallow your anger to get along with white counterparts who revere ancestors who raped and beat and enslaved your ancestors, you risk being accused of not really caring about symbols such as the Confederate flag and Confederate monuments. Your silence is used to suggest you are OK with how things are. Fairfax registered his anger, not with marches and chants, but with a quiet protest that should shame every other Virginia legislator who had neither the foresight nor moral courage to ask why Confederate heroes were still being honored by a public body. That\u2019s the rub. Private ceremonies by white private citizens on private property honoring Robert E. Lee or Jackson or Jefferson Davis or John C. Calhoun wouldn\u2019t be enough. For Confederate lovers and apologists, people of color must be forced to honor those men, too. The tax dollars of people of color must be used to construct and maintain large Confederate monuments and Confederate flags flying and displayed on public property. It must be that way even though black people had to survive chattel slavery, then a succession of violent white mobs who brought reconstruction to an end, then a century\u2019s worth of lynchings, then Jim Crow. It must be rubbed in our faces every day, not just on bumper stickers on pick-up trucks or in display windows of beachwear stores, but mindlessly by those we send to state capitals to represent us all.  Justin Fairfax\u2019s small gesture was a reminder of the power of nonviolent protest and the importance of standing firm on principles even when everyone around you mindlessly participated in wrongdoing. I don\u2019t know how successful his tenure as lieutenant governor will be, but he\u2019s already made a difference.",

She is a former assistant US attorney for the District of Columbia and trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. She is the host of the daily \u201cLaura Coates Show\u201d on SiriusXM. Follow her @thelauracoates. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. There is a misconception by some that women of the #MeToo movement relish their characterization as victims. This thinking goes that they were waiting for their chance to board the proverbial bandwagon for 15 minutes of fame \u2013 an approach that is patronizing at best. The truth of the matter is, women acknowledging their membership in this undesirable club is nothing more than an acknowledgment of how deep the roots of oppression can run in a country whose historical soil is fertilized with inequality. Sadly, I was not surprised when I learned of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s membership in this club, which she made public in remarks during an interview at the Sundance Film Festival. Ginsburg: For so long, women were silent \u201cEvery woman of my vintage knows about sexual harassment, but we didn\u2019t have a name for it,\u201d she said before recounting an instance in which a professor gave her a practice exam, which turned out to be identical to the real exam. \u201cI knew exactly what he wanted in return.\u201d But Justice Ginsburg\u2019s experiences with attempted exploitation didn\u2019t end with graduation. Even as a professor, she experienced sexism, gender pay inequity and workplace discrimination. Harassment, gender pay gaps, objectification, and sexual predation are hardly novel nor reserved for millennials. Climbing the professional ladder, whether as the first tenured woman at Columbia Law School or a Supreme Court justice, doesn\u2019t elevate you beyond the reach of bigotry. It merely gives you a better vantage point from which to observe the problems below.  And from where Ginsburg sits, the problem is incremental progress in the area of civil rights and subjective determinations by the powerful of whose lives, bodies, aspirations, or rights matter. When women unite, we're unstoppable The #MeToo movement has obvious parallels to \u2013 and distinctions from \u2013 the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Both movements are rooted in absolute truth. Both  involve the exploitation of power and the unavailability of legal recourse. Both are replete with tales ranging on the horror spectrum from eyebrow-raising to downright diabolical. But for the latter movement, stories of officer-involved shootings were dismissed at first as gratuitous race-baiting, then as exceptional cautionary tales, then as isolated incidents, then as pleas not to allow one bad apple to spoil the bunch. The court of public opinion was slow to grant validity, eventually yielding only to numbers tabulated in headstones. But in the post-#MeToo era, it seems the tide has changed. Anecdotes are sufficient; formal due process is perhaps optional.  Deaf ears are now empathetic, and unwilling to entertain the notion that misconduct could ever be \u201cjustifiable.\u201d What matters is listening to ensure that no one else will find their loved one\u2019s name next to a hashtag. Find it ironic? Me too. Amazingly, some people still think men are the real victims of #MeToo But Justice Ginsburg\u2019s revelation was hardly intended to identify a powerful irony. It was intended to acknowledge the powerful force of momentum. The Supreme Court hears but a lean fraction of cases seeking its review. Among the factors it considers is the divisiveness of the issue presented, the impact of the court\u2019s holding on the nation, and whether the conduct at issue offends our collective constitutional principles. But as landmark civil rights cases like Brown v. Board of Education or Lawrence v. Texas demonstrate, momentum has a way of catapulting an issue to the front of the figurative queue. But sometimes momentum yields unfortunate results. Before invalidating a key provision of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act that required states with a history of racial discrimination to get pre-authorization from the Department of Justice before making any changes to its voting laws, for instance, Chief Justice John Roberts implied the election of black men and women to political office placed us in a post-racial world that no longer required this kind of government oversight. Ginsburg correctly dissented, arguing instead that such protections were necessary in spite of perceptions of progress. She, like others who have experienced discrimination, understood that pruning the tree of oppression doesn\u2019t destroy its roots.  Milestones, no matter how significant, should neither be blindly touted nor used as an excuse to call off the watchdogs. It should shock and offend you that a nation this old should still be patted on the back for taking its first steps.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the #MeToo movement seems to prompt such visceral reactions. People believed that we were in a post-gender world. We\u2019re not. People are surprised to learn that democratic principles of equality remain aspirational, and elude huge segments of our population.  Even 45 years after the landmark decision of Roe v. Wade, the right of women to exercise autonomy over their bodies remains vulnerable to political attack. The litmus test for whether you believe in equality is not whether one wears a pin; it is whether you understand that equality is the linchpin of a democratic society. Are you surprised that people still don\u2019t understand that? Me too.",

The views expressed here are solely those of the authors. Suppose that in the last two years, you didn\u2019t show up to vote. Perhaps you couldn\u2019t make it to the polls, despite your best efforts, because it conflicted with your unpredictable work or child care schedule. Or perhaps you decided to abstain from voting in protest because you weren\u2019t pleased with any of the candidates. Or maybe you just forgot. If you live in Ohio, your failure to vote \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 for two years would have triggered a process that could have resulted in your being purged from the state\u2019s voter rolls. Ohio\u2019s process for purging voters who vote infrequently is precisely the kind of barrier to voting that violates federal law. Larry Harmon, an Ohio resident and plaintiff in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, expressed similar reasons for not voting. \u201cSometimes, I wasn\u2019t up on the politics,\u201d Harmon told an Ohio public radio station. \u201cOther times I didn\u2019t like either of the candidates.\u201d His case is now before the US Supreme Court. On Wednesday, the Court will hear oral arguments in his case, which challenges Ohio\u2019s practice of \u201cpurging\u201d people from its voter rolls for inactivity. Everyone who cares about the right to vote should pay close attention to how the justices approach this case. In keeping with federal protections, the Supreme Court should send a strong message that states should not purge eligible residents and voters from their rolls. Voting is a fundamental right and should not be a \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d proposition. Here\u2019s how it currently works. As part of their process for maintaining voter rolls, county election officials in Ohio mail notices to registered voters who have not voted for two years. If a voter does not respond to that single mailing \u2013 perhaps because she did not see it in a pile of junk mail or understand its significance \u2013 and does not vote for the next four years, the voter is automatically removed from the state\u2019s voter rolls. Listen to SCOTUS take up gerrymandering According to The Nation, from 2011 to 2016, Ohio \u2013 a state with more than 11 million residents \u2013 purged 840,000 voters from its voter rolls for such voting inactivity. In 2015, more than 40,000 voters were purged from the rolls in Cuyahoga County alone, which encompasses the city of Cleveland. A bipartisan Congress considered the burdens on eligible voters and election administrators alike of having to reregister after being purged. That is why Congress adopted federal laws that prohibit what Ohio is attempting to do. To be clear, states may properly remove voters who have died or moved to another state to maintain updated voter rolls. However, federal laws such as the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) and the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) prohibit states from removing voters solely for voting inactivity. Indeed, these laws were designed to expand access to the ballot, not make it more difficult to vote. Ohio\u2019s method of purging voters must also be considered in the context of the broader trend of state and local efforts to disenfranchise minority voters, using tools like voter ID laws in states like Texas and Alabama. Those efforts have accelerated since the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, removing federal review for changes to voting laws before their implementation in states and localities where racial discrimination in voting had been most prevalent. To make matters worse, the government institution that should be, and has previously been, protecting voting rights is missing in action. The Department of Justice has \u2013 for more than 20 years under Republican and Democratic administrations alike \u2013 recognized that broadening ballot access is the NVRA and HAVA\u2019s key objectives. How courts put the brakes on Texas voter discrimination Specifically, the DOJ correctly interpreted the NVRA and HAVA to prohibit states from triggering a voter purge based on voting inactivity. DOJ maintained that position in this very case in the lower courts. Yet, after Jeff Sessions was sworn in as attorney general, DOJ made a startling about-face, siding with Ohio. DOJ has offered no principled justification for this U-turn. This is no surprise. In 2013, then-Sen. Sessions described the Voting Rights Act as \u201cintrusive legislation\u201d and referred to the Shelby County v. Holder ruling as \u201cgood news\u201d for the South. This year, the Sessions-led DOJ also reversed course in a lawsuit in which NAACP Legal Defense & Education Fund (LDF) and our co-counsel have successfully shown that Texas\u2019 voter ID law \u2013 the strictest voter ID law in the nation \u2013 purposefully discriminates against black and Latino voters. Even though a federal district court has twice found that the law was motivated by intentional discrimination, the Sessions Justice Department abandoned that claim. In light of these startling reversals and the Justice Department\u2019s politicized agenda, the Supreme Court should be highly skeptical of its new arguments, which directly contradict the once-established position in support of voters\u2019 rights. This is why the organization where we work, the LDF, filed an amicus brief opposing Ohio\u2019s purge process and highlighting DOJ\u2019s lack of a meaningful basis for its reversal in position.  When the Supreme Court has acted to give more leeway to voter ID laws or undermined the Voting Rights Act, states and local jurisdictions (as LDF has been documenting) have been quick to unleash repressive measures that make it harder for people to vote. But the Husted case could be a fresh opportunity to correct course. By invalidating Ohio\u2019s purge process, the Supreme Court can make clear that voting is a fundamental right for which states should be expanding access, not limiting it.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department is proposing a new question for the US Census that could throw a chill over the nation\u2019s decennial headcount. According to new reporting from ProPublica, the Department of Justice wants to add a citizenship question to the 2020 Census.  A DOJ official made this request to the bureau in a letter dated December 12.  The letter argues that the DOJ needs the citizenship data to protect minority populations from \u201cracial discrimination in voting.\u201d But does anyone seriously believe that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, head of the Department of Justice, is concerned about minority voting rights? His past indicates otherwise.   He can frame his motivation for wanting citizenship information in worthy terms all he wants, but the reality is that such a change to the census could have far-reaching implications \u2013 none of them good. US Census Fast Facts The proposed change goes against the longstanding mission of the census \u201cto serve as the leading source of quality data about the nation\u2019s people and economy\u201d  and would politicize the critical decennial population count. The full census typically asks questions about race, housing, marital status and other topics. It has not included a citizenship question since 1950.   As to the proposed new question, according to the ProPublica report, \u201cthe DOJ declined to comment and the White House did not respond to a request for comment.\u201d Asking about citizenship on the census would most likely lower the number of responses, particularly among Latinos and immigrants. The importance of the census cannot be overstated.  Data collected from the survey affect how congressional seats are apportioned and how federal funds are allocated to state and local governments.  It affects the distribution of money for community necessities like services for senior citizens, roads and schools, and job training centers.  That\u2019s what makes this potential move by the administration so troubling. Trump is doing to the Dreamers what was done to him Since the census began in 1790, its goal has been to count all people, not just citizens.  The 14th Amendment states, \u201cRepresentatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed.\u201d The founding fathers could have inserted the word \u201ccitizens\u201d in this provision, as they did in other sections of the Constitution, but they did not.  Clearly, their intent was that apportionment of representatives, which depends on census results, should be based on who is present in the country, period. As recently as 2016, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that election districts could be drawn based on total population, instead of the number of people eligible to vote. So any ideas that the Trump DOJ might have about collecting citizenship data \u2013 with an eye toward changing how congressional districts are drawn \u2013 would potentially undermine the spirit of that ruling. But the most serious concern here is that asking about citizenship on the census would reduce the total numbers of responses.  Thanks to Trump\u2019s often ugly rhetoric (such as referring to some Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d) and the actions of his administration (such as the cancellation of DACA), there is little trust between immigrants and the government. Trump lays out immigration deal demands The Pew Hispanic Center has noted that in 2010 there were an estimated 9 million \u201cmixed-status\u201d families in the United States \u2014 that is, families in  which some members of a household are citizens and some are not. It is no stretch to imagine that such households would prefer to skip the census altogether rather than give the Trump administration information that could potentially be used to deport some of their loved ones. In fact, fear among the immigrant population over the census has already been noted.  In November, a government official warned that early test surveys showed that immigrants were wary of providing personal information to the government.  The bureau\u2019s Mikelyn Meyers reported an \u201cunprecedented groundswell in confidentiality and data-sharing concerns among immigrants or those who live with immigrants \u201d related to the 2020 count \u2013 and this was before news broke about the potential citizenship question. What\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s Justice Department seems to be trying to get this citizenship question added at the last minute. ProPublica points out that new questions are \u201cusually carefully field-tested, a process that can take years.\u201d   Even then, problems still arise; the bureau has struggled for years to find the best way for Latinos to self-identify their race and ethnicity.  And it doesn\u2019t exactly inspire confidence that the man Trump is considering  to head the bureau, Thomas Brunell, has no government experience and once wrote a book called \u201cRedistricting and Representation: Why Competitive Elections Are Bad for America.\u201d  According to the ProPublica report, \u201cThe law governing the census gives the commerce secretary, currently Wilbur Ross, the power to decide on questions. They must be submitted to Congress for review two years before the census, in this case by April 2018. A census spokesperson said the agency will also release the questions publicly at that time.\u201d Perhaps the Justice Department has legitimate reasons for wanting to know the number of citizens in the country.  But it  can get that information from the American Community Survey, which is conducted every year by the bureau and already asks about citizenship. The bureau should be trying to formulate ways to build bridges with minority and immigrant populations, not taking actions that will scare off potential respondents. The Census Bureau should resist the DOJ\u2019s efforts to sabotage its work with an intrusive citizenship question. An accurate 2020 census count is essential for everyone living in the United States.",

Let\u2019s try to get our arms around it all: \u2013 President Trump\u2019s national security team meets again today to discuss a response to the chemical attack in Syria. The President caught his aides, the Pentagon and US allies off-guard (again) with his tweets that \u201cnice and new and \u2018smart!\u2019\u201d missiles would be fired toward the country. Now, Syrian forces have\u00a0retaken the area\u00a0where the attack happened, Russia says. \u2013 Trump praised House Speaker Paul Ryan, who said he won\u2019t seek re-election.

            "article_content": "The first major surprise of the 2020 campaign came on Monday when Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander (R) announced he would not run for a third term in two years\u2019 time. \u201cI am deeply grateful, but now it is time for someone else to have that privilege,\u201d Alexander said in a statement. There\u2019s a tendency when these sort of unexpected \u2013 or at least un-leaked \u2013 retirements happen to see them as events that fundamentally alter the chess board both parties are playing on in the never-ending fight over the Senate majority. Some are! Most aren\u2019t. And Lamar\u2019s(!) retirement fits squarely in that latter category. Had he run for a third term, he would have likely won. His biggest problem would have almost certainly come in a Republican primary, where Alexander\u2019s pragmatic approach to governance \u2013 a style that once made him a serious presidential candidate \u2013 had riled some conservatives more closely aligned with President Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational conservatism. (Alexander beat back a primary challenger aligned with the tea party in 2014 although the little known candidate got north of 40% of the vote.) While his retirement \u2013 and the open seat it creates \u2013 might seem alluring for Democrats at first glance, the 2018 election results should beat that optimism out of them. In that race, Democrats nominated popular former Gov. Phil Bredesen, who polls showed running neck and neck with Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R) for months. But Blackburn wound up winning by 11 points despite Bredesen\u2019s popularity and a national wind blowing strongly behind Democrats. What that proved \u2013 or should have proved \u2013 is that the Volunteer State is effectively impenetrable for any Democrat \u2013 even one as well-known and well liked as Bredesen. People forget just how Trump-y Tennessee was in 2016; the President Donald Trump won the state 61% to 35% over Hillary Clinton. Add it all up and you get this: Tennessee just isn\u2019t a terribly competitive state at the Senate level these days. (And that\u2019s even before the news broke the outgoing GOP Gov. Bill Haslam, who is very, very rich, is considering a run for the Lamar(!) seat.) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! The Tennessee seat doesn\u2019t change the basic math of the 2020 Senate map of which we already know a few things: What\u2019s clear from those three facts is that while the raw numbers clearly favor Democrats in 2020, the actual states that make up the map are far less favorable for Democrats. Comparisons between this map for Democrats and the 2018 map for Republicans \u2013 25 Democrats seats up including 10 in states Trump won in 2016 \u2013 aren\u2019t even close to fair. Republicans have lots more seats up, yes, but when you look at the seats that should be most vulnerable for the two parties, there\u2019s a lot more parity. The Alabama seat held by Sen. Doug Jones (D) is, without question, the most endangered seat held by either party; had Republicans nominated anyone other than Roy Moore in the 2017 special election, Jones would have never sniffed the Senate. That said, this map \u2013 at least at it looks today \u2013 is not inhospitable for Democratic gains. (The party needs to net four seats to retake Senate control if Trump holds the White House; they need a three-seat gain if a Democrat is elected president in 2020.) Colorado\u2019s Cory Gardner (R) will almost certainly face a serious Democratic challenge in a state Clinton won by 5 points in 2016. Ditto Rep. Martha McSally in Arizona who GOP Gov. Doug Ducey named Tuesday to replace Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl (R), who is resigning at the end of this year. Arizona Democrats are emboldened after Sen.-elect Kyrsten Sinema became the first Democrat since Dennis DeConcini to win a Senate race in the Grand Canyon State in 2018. Just below that level of vulnerability come a handful of GOP senators representing states where Democrats have had success at the federal level in the recent past or believe the demographics of the state are tilting their way: Thom Tillis in North Carolina, David Perdue in Georgia and Joni Ernst in Iowa. And, finally, two special cases. The first is Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Senate\u2019s majority leader. McConnell has been in the Senate since 1984 but rarely wins by overwhelming margins due to his incredibly polarized image in the state. It\u2019s hard to see Democrats giving McConnell a pass in 2020, but his destruction of highly touted Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes in 2014 should serve as a warning to any opponent thinking beating McConnell will be easy \u2013 or cheap. The second is in Maine, where Sen. Susan Collins (R) has long been assumed to be unbeatable despite the fact that the state has tended to favor Democrats at the presidential level in recent elections. Democrats argue all that changed when Collins provided the deciding vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court earlier this year. That single vote, her opponents insist, crystallize the point they have been making for decades about Collins: She talks like a moderate but is always there when McConnell needs her on a critical vote. Everyone from former UN Ambassador Susan Rice to the speaker of Maine\u2019s state House have hinted that they might take on Collins, although it remains to be seen who actually makes the race. Outside of Jones in Alabama, the list of targeted Democratic incumbents is short. Republicans will give Michigan Sen. Gary Peters (D) a hard look given that Trump won the state in 2016. But Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D) easily dispatched a GOP challenger touted by Trump in 2018. New Hampshire has a closely divided electorate that could attract a serious challenger for Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, although the former governor would start out as a clear favorite. Ditto Mark Warner in Virginia. Republicans could, theoretically, challenge Sen. Tina Smith in Minnesota, but there\u2019s little to suggest the state would elect a Republican to Senate in 2020. The Point: You\u2019d rather be Democrats than Republicans when looking at the 2020 map. But there is no sure-thing path back to the majority for Senate Democrats on this 2020 map. Not even close.",

            "article_content": "In the hectic eight days after President Donald Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and top FBI officials viewed Trump as a leader who needed to be reined in, according to two sources describing the sentiment at the time. They discussed a range of options, including the idea of Rosenstein wearing a wire while speaking with Trump, which Rosenstein later denied. Ultimately, then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe took the extraordinary step of opening an obstruction of justice investigation even before special counsel Robert Mueller was appointed, the sources said. The obstruction probe was an idea the FBI had previously considered, but it didn\u2019t start until after Comey was fired. The justification went beyond Trump\u2019s firing of Comey, according to the sources, and also included the President\u2019s conversation with Comey in the Oval Office asking him to drop the investigation into his former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The new details about the genesis of the obstruction case into Trump that became a key element of the Mueller probe shed light on the chaotic week following Comey\u2019s firing and the scramble to decide how best to respond. They also help to explain the origins of the Mueller investigation that has stretched across 19 months, consumed Trump\u2019s presidency and is building toward a dramatic day of courtroom filings on Friday. Roger Stone says he is not sharing information with the President's lawyers A Justice Department official strongly disputed Rosenstein sought to curb the President, emphasizing that his conversations with McCabe were simply about talking through ways to conduct the investigation. \u201cHe never said anything like that,\u201d the source added. Other sources said that the FBI would only take such dramatic action if officials suspected a crime had been committed. But Rosenstein and other senior FBI officials also had deep concerns about Trump\u2019s behavior and thought he needed to be checked, according to the sources. A spokeswoman for McCabe did not provide comment for this story. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking that the FBI would open up an obstruction case for the President exercising his authority under Article II,\u201d said the President\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani. Robert Mueller Fast Facts The Washington Post first reported last year that the obstruction investigation started before Mueller\u2019s appointment, but the sources offered a more complete picture of the drastic actions law enforcement leaders took during that feverish period. Prior to Comey\u2019s firing, top FBI officials had discussed opening an obstruction investigation based on the President saying to Comey, \u201cI hope you can let this go\u201d when discussing Flynn. That episode was later described in memos Comey wrote following the February meeting that the former FBI director would leak soon after his firing. Comey\u2019s attorney did not comment for this story, but pointed to Comey\u2019s 2017 testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Comey, however, hinted at the discussion in his book. Former Trump White House lawyer emerges as a contender for attorney general \u201cWe resolved to figure out down the road what to do with the president\u2019s request and its implications as our investigation progressed,\u201d he wrote. Then, on May 9, Comey was fired. The subsequent meetings led by Rosenstein and McCabe were held soon after the White House made clear that Rosenstein\u2019s memo addressing concerns about Comey\u2019s conduct during the Hillary Clinton probe was central to the President\u2019s decision. One of the sources likened it to \u201cspitballing\u201d about potential steps in the mold of \u201cWhat are the options. What makes sense. What doesn\u2019t?\u201d For the deputy attorney general, the obstruction investigation into Trump and the appointment of the special counsel has turned his entire Justice Department tenure into an awkward role of supervising the Mueller investigation after he \u2013 voluntarily, sources said \u2013 wrote the memo justifying Comey\u2019s firing. Critics have argued the Comey memo makes Rosenstein a potential witness in the obstruction case. One source said there were \u201cdifferent conversations at different times with different people.\u201d The President then raised the stakes, telling NBC News in an interview that he fired Comey because of the \u201cRussia thing.\u201d Among the ideas discussed were opening an obstruction probe and appointing a special counsel, which were ultimately done in quick succession, less than two weeks after Comey was fired. Rosenstein also raised the idea of wearing a wire while speaking with Trump and exploring whether Cabinet members would invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office. Those additional ideas, first reported by The New York Times, were taken seriously by some officials but did not come to pass, and one source in the room has dismissed Rosenstein\u2019s comments on the wire as sarcasm. Trump's aggressive bid to define Mueller's end game Rosenstein\u2019s original public announcement appointing the special counsel did not specifically reference the obstruction issue, only \u201cthe previously-confirmed FBI investigation of Russian government efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related matters.\u201d But the order setting up the special counsel did include the legal code that includes investigating matters related to obstruction. Rosenstein has been under constant fire from Trump and a frequent target of the President\u2019s tweets, and he was prepared to be fired after his comments about wearing a wire and the 25th Amendment were reported. He survived at the Justice Department but was passed over as acting attorney general for Jeff Sessions\u2019 chief of staff Matt Whitaker, who was seen as a loyalist to Trump and has publicly criticized the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Both McCabe and Rosenstein have felt the withering criticism of the President. Just last week, Trump tweeted out a picture of Rosenstein in prison. Asked why he did that in an interview with The New York Post, Trump responded, \u201cHe never should have picked a special counsel.\u201d No clarity on whether Whitaker sought ethics advice on potential conflicts in Russia probe This week, Rosenstein joked during a speech to \u201clet the President know that his favorite deputy attorney general was here.\u201d Trump has submitted written answers to Mueller\u2019s team about potential collusion between members of Trump\u2019s team and Russian officials, but he has not answered questions from the special counsel related to obstruction. It\u2019s still not clear whether Mueller will try to seek additional written testimony or an in-person interview from Trump related to the obstruction investigation. The President\u2019s lawyers have signaled they won\u2019t answer questions on obstruction because the time period falls under executive privilege. In the days immediately after Comey was fired, McCabe pushed for the appointment of a special counsel but Rosenstein seemed hesitant, despite many calls to do so. On May 11, two days after Comey was fired, Rosenstein briefed Republican Senate Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, who were running their own Russia investigation. According to contemporaneous text messages between FBI officials, \u201cWarner conveyed that he wanted (a) special counsel\u201d and Rosenstein \u201csaid he took that under advisement.\u201d McCabe and Rosenstein later met with the full \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d the Republican and Democratic congressional leaders and intelligence committee heads, the day Mueller was appointed. Separately, Comey was orchestrating his own campaign to create public outcry for a special counsel. The former FBI director had a key memo about his interactions with Trump leaked to The New York Times, which published an article that Trump had asked Comey to go easy on Flynn on May 16. Mueller was appointed the next day. It is not clear why the FBI first moved to open a case just before the appointment of a special counsel. However, the investigation of the President could have been seen as an impetus for having an independent team investigate given the sensitivities. At the time, those pushing for special counsel were focused on protecting the Russia investigation from further efforts by Trump to curtail it. CNN\u2019s Laura Jarrett, Evan Perez and Josh Campbell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "CNN Special Report \u201cRemembering 41: President George H.W. Bush\u201d airs tonight at 8 p.m. ET. George H.W. Bush, the 41st President, whose steady hand and foreign policy vision led the nation through a period of sweeping global change, has died at the age of 94. Bush\u2019s death, late Friday at his home in Houston, was announced by his son and fellow Republican, former President George W. Bush, who praised his father as \u201ca man of the highest character.\u201d Born into privilege and a tradition of service, Bush was a son of a senator, celebrated World War II combat pilot, student athlete, Texas oilman, Republican congressman, national party chairman, pioneering diplomat and spy chief. After his own 1980 presidential campaign came up short, he served two terms as Ronald Reagan\u2019s vice president before reaching the pinnacle of political power by winning the 1988 presidential election, soundly defeating Democrat Michael Dukakis. After losing the White House in 1992, Bush became a widely admired political elder who leapt out of airplanes to mark birthday milestones. Emphasizing the generosity of his soul, he forged a close \u2013 and unlikely \u2013 friendship with Democrat Bill Clinton, the man who ended his presidency. When Parkinson\u2019s disease mostly silenced him in public, Bush flashed his sense of humor by sporting colorful striped socks. Bush\u2019s death comes after his wife of 73 years, Barbara Bush, passed away on April 17 at age 92. Before her funeral, Bush was pictured in a wheelchair gazing at his wife\u2019s flower-covered casket, in a moment that encapsulated their life-long love affair. On his final day, Bush was asked, according to a source, whether he wanted to go to the hospital. The former president said no, and that he was ready to go and be with Barbara and Robin, who died of leukemia as a child. A source familiar with Bush\u2019s final hours told CNN that Bush spoke his final words to his son, George W., during a phone call. In the conversation, the son told the senior George Bush that he had been a \u201cwonderful father.\u201d \u201cI love you, too,\u201d his father replied. The elder Bush\u2019s final words were first reported by the New York Times. President George H.W. Bush's life in pictures The first sitting vice president to be elected to the presidency since 1836, Bush was also only the second person in US history to see his own son follow in his presidential footsteps when George W. Bush was elected in 2000. In addition to the 43rd president, Bush is survived by his son Jeb, the former Florida governor and 2016 presidential candidate; sons Neil and Marvin; daughter Dorothy; and 17 grandchildren. His daughter Robin died of leukemia as a child, a tragedy that still moved Bush deeply late in his life. He will be buried alongside her and the former first lady at his presidential library in College Station, Texas. Bush will lie in state at the US Capitol before a memorial service at the National Cathedral in Washington, DC, with a second memorial service to follow at St. Martin\u2019s Episcopal Church in Houston. He will then be taken by a motorcade procession to the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library in College Station, Texas, where he will be laid to rest. Specific times and more details will be announced at a later time, according to the statement released by Bush\u2019s spokesman Jim McGrath. President Donald Trump will designate December 5 as a national day of mourning, according to a White House statement, and the President and first lady Melania Trump will attend the funeral at the National Cathedral. Family and political world react to George H.W. Bush's death When Bush left office in 1993, he joined the dubious club of presidents rejected by voters after only one term in office. A career filled with top jobs preparing him for the presidency was cut short in its prime. He lost to Clinton after failing to shake off his image as a starchy Yankee oblivious to the struggles of heartland Americans during an economic downturn. But as time passed, his foreign policy acumen has come to define his presidency, leaving a legacy of wise and sure-handed management of world affairs. Bush, alongside national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State James Baker, engineered a soft landing for the Cold War as the Soviet empire shattered and Germany unified and then prospered \u2013 despite widespread distrust at the time of its history and motives. In another dangerous foreign policy test, Bush decided in 1990 to build a diverse international coalition, including more than 400,000 US troops, to eject Iraqi forces from Kuwait. \u201cThis will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait,\u201d Bush vowed before getting to work on a successful mission that united US allies in Europe and the Middle East in a lightning war. Later, with Iraqi forces routed, Bush decided not to push on to Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein. That instinct later came to look prescient, given the blood and resources expended by the United States in his son\u2019s own war against Iraq. George H.W. Bush had the spirit this country needs today The 1990s Gulf War was the first time the world learned of the huge leaps in precision weaponry used by US forces and ushered in a brief era of unchallenged American hegemony after the dented confidence of the post-Vietnam war era. Earlier, Bush had also ordered US troops to invade Panama after an off-duty Marine was killed by forces loyal to dictator Manuel Noriega. The force quickly overwhelmed Noriega\u2019s men and he was overthrown in just four days and was later sentenced to 40 years in US federal prison on drug charges. Bush also had to walk a fine line with China, imposing sanctions after a 1989 government crackdown on Tiananmen Square in Beijing, but also seeking to prevent a permanent rupture in relations. Also on his watch, Washington backed early diplomacy between Israel and the Palestinians, which led to the Oslo accords in the Clinton presidency. But Bush\u2019s success abroad became a cross to bear at home. Voters appeared to get the impression he was more interested in striding the world stage than their economic struggles. His failure to connect was encapsulated by an incident in which his fascination with a supermarket scanner during his 1992 re-election campaign triggered widespread mockery. Former aides to this day insist that Bush was maligned by a New York Times report on the incident, which they say resulted from a misinterpretation of a pool report. But in another incident, Bush exacerbated the idea he was out of touch by looking at his watch in a town-hall style presidential debate, then waffled when a woman asked how he was personally affected by the bad economy. Bush was often criticized for lacking an overarching political philosophy, a charge he testily decried by complaining about \u201cthe vision thing.\u201d He managed to undermine himself with powerful GOP conservatives by breaking his famous 1988 GOP convention pledge: \u201cRead my lips: no new taxes.\u201d On Election Day, with the right-of-center vote fragmented by third-party candidate and billionaire businessman Ross Perot, Bush carried only 18 states and just over 37% of the vote. What George H. W. Bush asked for in his inaugural speech In many ways, Bush paid a price for ragged presentation skills. Even before his 1988 presidential campaign, there were questions about his political fortitude. Newsweek magazine, which in pre-social media days had immense power to set the political media narrative, published a cover story questioning whether the President was beset by the \u201cwimp factor.\u201d In her 1988 Democratic convention keynote speech, then-Texas Treasurer Ann Richards had lampooned Bush\u2019s upbringing and tongue-tied political style by joking Bush was \u201cborn with a silver foot in his mouth.\u201d Other incidents in Bush\u2019s presidency entered popular culture. Once, he caused a brief panic when he collapsed at a state dinner in Japan. He blamed the embarrassment on a stomach illness. In 1990, he banned broccoli on Air Force One, saying he had hated it since he was a kid. Bush faded from view during the Clinton years, but was thrust back into the spotlight \u2013 and became the subject of a torrent of amateur psychology \u2013 when his son ran for president in 2000. Once his son entered office, those expecting a restoration of the elder Bush\u2019s ways were disappointed. The new president responded to the September 11, 2001, attacks by rejecting the internationalism of his father and embracing the neo-conservative doctrine of preemptive war. A look back at George H.W. Bush's legacy There was much speculation about what Bush thought of his son\u2019s actions in Iraq, especially after some of his foreign policy lieutenants went public with criticisms of US policy. But the elder Bush kept quiet in public, though he was outraged when Democrats branded George W. Bush a \u201cliar\u201d during his 2004 re-election bid. The attacks on his other son, Jeb, who endured a bruising primary battle in 2016 against Donald Trump, the eventual GOP nominee and 45th president, caused him deep personal pain. Sources said the elder Bush voted for Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s Democratic rival. Both former Bush presidents did call to congratulate Trump soon after the New York businessman\u2019s win over Clinton. In one of his final political acts, Bush wrote to Trump to apologize for not being able to not attend his inauguration owing to his poor health. But in many ways, the acerbic and bitterly divisive election of 2016 represented a final wrenching departure from the more courtly, old-fashioned politics practiced by George H.W. Bush, who until late in his life would pen handwritten notes to friends, former political allies and foes and even reporters who covered his presidency. He counted Democrats among his closest friends, and his death marks not only the passing of a president but a reminder of a bygone era of greater civility in Washington. Born in Massachusetts on June 12, 1924, George H. W. Bush was the son of wealthy Wall Street banker and future Connecticut Sen. Prescott Bush and Dorothy Bush. He became the youngest naval pilot at age 18 following Japan\u2019s attack on Pearl Harbor and flew combat missions from the aircraft carrier USS San Jacinto. As a \u201cflyboy\u201d in the Pacific War, Bush flew 58 combat missions and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. One mission in September 1944 was almost his last. Bush\u2019s air wing attacked a radio installation on the tiny Japanese-held island of Chichi Jima. During the raid, his plane was hit and as flames licked around the cockpit, Bush gave the order to abandon the aircraft. The bodies of his crewmen, Ted White and John Delaney were never found. Bush, after desperately paddling his life raft away from the island and Japanese boats sent out to capture him, was miraculously rescued by a U.S. submarine. It took decades before Bush was able to speak publicly about his experiences in the war. \u201cIt was just part of my duty. People say, \u2018war hero.\u2019 How come a guy who gets his airplane shot down is a hero and a guy who\u2019s good enough that he doesn\u2019t get shot down is not?\u201d Bush told CNN in 2003. Late in his life, the former president\u2019s heroism was recognized when the Navy named a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier after him. After returning from the Pacific, Bush attended Yale University, where he was a noted athlete and then went west with his new wife, Barbara Pierce, to set himself up as an early Texas oil prospector. By the mid-1960s, politics was calling and Bush ran for the US Senate, but lost. In 1966, however, he was on his way, winning a seat in the House of Representatives. Chosen by President Richard Nixon to serve as envoy to the United Nations, Bush later served as the head of the Republican National Committee during the Watergate scandal. Then, he became one of the few prominent Westerners to get into China, which had been closed to outsiders for decades. Bush headed the US Liaison Office in Beijing, the forerunner of the US Embassy. He later detailed his experiences, including trips into the Chinese countryside on bicycles, in diaries published in 2008. In 1976, Bush became the head of the CIA. He only held the job for a year, but was so well remembered that the agency later named its headquarters in Langley, Virginia, after him, and he would later say it was his favorite job. In 1980, Bush ran for the White House, challenging former California Gov. Ronald Reagan for the GOP nomination, slamming what he said was his foe\u2019s \u201cvoodoo economic policy.\u201d After a sometimes rancorous campaign, Reagan won, and after briefly flirting with picking former president Gerald Ford as his running mate, handed Bush the vice presidential spot. With Reagan set to leave office in 1989, with his popularity ratings on a high, Bush was in the ideal spot to claim the nomination and the presidency. \u201cI may not be the most eloquent, but I learned early that eloquence won\u2019t draw oil from the ground,\u201d Bush said in his 1988 convention speech. \u201cI may sometimes be a little awkward, but there\u2019s nothing self-conscious in my love of country. I am a quiet man \u2013 but I hear the quiet people others don\u2019t,\u201d Bush said, vowing to fight for a \u201cbetter America, for an endless enduring dream and a thousand points of light.\u201d It\u2019s an irony that it was not until he was well-settled in retirement that many Americans began to get glimpses into the character traits that might have helped him win a second term. Refusing to bow to advancing age, he marked his 75th, 80th, 85th and 90th birthdays by going skydiving, with the money going to charity. His primary causes included literacy, cancer research and volunteerism, and he and Barbara Bush would raise more than $1 billion for charity in their years after the White House. Bush 41 takes a dive on his 90th birthday He and Clinton became close friends after working together after the Asian tsunami disaster in 2004 and after Hurricane Katrina the following year. \u201cIt was an amazing experience. This man who I had always liked and respected and ran against \u2026 I literally came to love,\u201d Clinton said in 2011. President Barack Obama awarded Bush the Presidential Medal of Freedom that same year. Several bouts with illness and advanced age kept Bush out of the spotlight in recent years and he has rarely made public remarks. But, in November 2014, he was in the audience in a wheelchair when George W. Bush published a biography entitled \u201c41: A Portrait of My Father.\u201d The younger Bush poignantly said he \u201cwanted Dad to be alive\u201d when the book came out. In 2017, several women accused Bush of inappropriately touching them during photo ops, prompting his spokesman to release a statement saying that \u201con occasion, (Bush) has patted women\u2019s rears in what he intended to be a good-natured manner\u201d and apologizing to \u201canyone he has offended.\u201d The elder Bush revealed several years ago he suffered from a form of Parkinson\u2019s disease which left him unable to walk. He used a wheelchair or a scooter to get around. Bush suffered multiple health scares later in his life. In December 2014 he was hospitalized for what aides described as a precautionary measure after experiencing shortness of breath, and the following July fell at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, breaking the C2 vertebrae in his neck. The injury did not result in any neurological problems, his spokesman said at the time. This story has been updated. CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Wednesday that special counsel Robert Mueller could still try to seek additional answers from Trump on questions of potential obstruction of justice, but he signaled they will fight any questions they believe violate executive privilege. \u201cIt\u2019s not on the table, but could be put back on the table,\u201d Giuliani told CNN of obstruction questions. Trump submitted written responses to the special counsel\u2019s office on Tuesday to respond to questions surrounding collusion between Russian officials and Trump\u2019s team during the campaign. But Giuliani made clear the process isn\u2019t over and the President\u2019s legal team is willing to answer follow up questions from Mueller\u2019s team. \u201cWe\u2019ll consider them and answer them if necessary, relevant and legal,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cIf it was something that would be helpful, relevant \u2014 not a law school exam.\u201d RELATED: Trump legal team balks at Mueller\u2019s questions on post-2016 election activity The written responses submitted to the special counsel on Tuesday came following months of negotiations between Trump\u2019s legal team and the special counsel over how exactly the President would answer questions in the Mueller investigation. The responses dealt with events during the presidential campaign and before Trump was sworn into office, but there are still looming questions about how much Trump\u2019s legal team addressed events during the presidential transition in its responses, as well as any additional questions from Mueller. The prospect of an in-person interview with Trump is also unresolved, although Trump said this week that was \u201cprobably\u201d off the table. Trump legal team balks at Mueller's questions on post-2016 election activity The thinking of those in the President\u2019s circle is that the new acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker would not approve of a subpoena for a presidential interview if Mueller\u2019s team goes that route, according to a source close to the President. Trump\u2019s legal team has signaled they\u2019d fight questions about the transition and Trump\u2019s time in the White House on the grounds of executive privilege. Giuliani said they would likely argue that Mueller\u2019s team got what they needed on obstruction of justice questions from other witnesses, and if Mueller\u2019s team delves deeper into the issue it \u201cwould involve a real intrusion into privilege.\u201d But Giuliani also noted there was a \u201cgray area legally\u201d when it came to the presidential transition and executive privilege, since Trump had not yet taken office. Giuliani described the questions as a law school exam: complex with subset questions. He said the questions included what Trump knew about Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s June 2016 meeting with the Russians at Trump Tower, as well as asking about the President\u2019s own comments about dirt on Hillary Clinton following the meeting at Trump Tower and his comments asking Russia to find Clinton\u2019s missing emails. Giuliani said that the special counsel\u2019s office had indicated they will respond quickly to Trump\u2019s answers \u2014 he said it could be a week to 10 days \u2014 and said they would \u201cin good faith determine do we really need any more.\u201d One of the delays in returning the response was speculation among Trump\u2019s legal team that Mueller would release indictments before Thanksgiving, according to a person who speaks to the President. And they were worried about sending the responses without knowing what Mueller might do in the short term. But in the end, they decided to just send the answers in, the person said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an answer that will surprise them very much,\u201d Giuliani said of the responses. \u201cNone of the answers have changed. Maybe we corrected a date or two. Nothing important changed.\u201d CNN\u2019s Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump on Friday afternoon awarded seven individuals the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor in a ceremony punctuated with humor and remembrance. Trump\u2019s most controversial pick was philanthropist Miriam Adelson, the wife of GOP megadonor Sheldon Adelson. Trump posthumously bestowed the honor on baseball phenom Babe Ruth, rock and roll legend Elvis Presley and Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia. The other recipients \u2013 Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, and former professional football players Justice Alan Page and Roger Staubach \u2013 attended the White House ceremony. \u201cThe Presidential Medal of Freedom has been given to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to American life and culture. This year it is my true privilege to award this honor to seven extraordinary Americans,\u201d Trump said. Trump signs measure overhauling DHS cybersecurity efforts Trump joked Scalia was \u201cvery busy\u201d making nine children. \u201cJoining us for this ceremony is (Judge Scalia\u2019s) wife, Maureen \u2013 who has become a great friend of my family, myself \u2013 and their nine children,\u201d Trump said before listing each of the Scalia children. \u201cYou were very busy, wow. Wow. I always knew I liked him,\u201d Trump said, sparking some laughter from the audience. He also paused for a moment as a few lines of a Presley song played during the ceremony, then joking he wished the whole song could play out. Speaking about Hatch, Trump offered bluntly: \u201cHe liked me from the beginning and therefore I like him.\u201d \u201cIt helps. That\u2019s the way it is. I guess I\u2019m not supposed to say it, but that\u2019s the way life works,\u201d he added. First lady Melania Trump, acting-Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta and acting-Environmental Protection Agency administrator Andrew Wheeler,  were in attendance, as well as several Supreme Court justices. Trump also announced during the ceremony that he\u2019s picked Wheeler to permanently lead the EPA. Miriam Adelson is cited by the White House for founding research centers committed to fighting substance abuse and, with her husband, establishing the Adelson Medical Research Foundation, which supports research on life-threatening illnesses. She has also supported Jewish schools, Holocaust memorial organizations, and Israeli military personnel and veterans, the White House noted. The $5 billion election: How the 2018 midterms became the most expensive in history The Adelsons were the most prolific individual donors of the 2018 midterms, according to an analysis by OpenSecrets, with the couple giving at least $113 million during the cycle, all of it to Republican causes. That total could rise once the final round of fundraising reports are published by the Federal Election Commission, and doesn\u2019t include potential \u201cdark money\u201d contributions to groups faced with less strict disclosure rules. Past Medal of Freedom recipients during the Obama administration, including singer Barbra Streisand, media mogul Oprah Winfrey, baseball player Ernie Banks, Judge Patricia Wald, psychologist Daniel Kahneman and journalist Ben Bradlee, all made donations to Democratic and Obama-related political funds. Honoring donors is a move that\u2019s been criticized by both sides of the aisle. Alyssa Farrah, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s current press secretary, wrote in a 2013 Mic story about the Obama-era honorees, arguing that \u201cawarding favors to political supporters is hardly a new practice in the US, but bestowing one of the nation\u2019s historically most prestigious honors to a roll call of presidential donors may raise eyebrows.\u201d CNN\u2019s David Wright and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As he was preparing to remove Jeff Sessions as attorney general, President Donald Trump had already begun reviewing with his lawyers the written answers to questions from special counsel Robert Mueller. What does Sessions' firing mean for Mueller? The move to replace Sessions with Matt Whitaker, who has been openly critical of the special counsel, comes as the White House braces for a return of public activity on the Russia investigation following a pre-election quiet period, according to people briefed on the matter. As acting attorney general, Whitaker also now takes over Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein\u2019s role in overseeing the special counsel probe, which officials inside the Justice Department and lawyers representing witnesses believe is moving closer to a conclusion. Mueller\u2019s team has begun writing its final report, multiple sources told CNN. Before that happens, one of the major questions in the Russia investigation remains to be answered: What happens to Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser who has been at the center of a whirlwind of legal activity behind the scenes even during the election-related public quiet period by Mueller. As recently as a month ago, Mueller asked Trump\u2019s lawyers to produce call and visitor logs related to Stone from Trump Tower in New York, according to a source briefed on the matter. The request at this late stage of the investigation came as something of a surprise to lawyers involved, given that the Mueller team has been focused for months on Stone and his activities before the 2016 election. Among the questions Mueller has asked the President to provide written responses on are queries about Stone and his communications with then-candidate Trump, according to a source briefed on the matter. Despite the change in leadership at the Justice Department, the Trump legal team believes it won\u2019t affect its approach to the Mueller questions, according to one source familiar with the matter. Trump strikes, sensing post-midterm window to wound Mueller The President and his lawyers have been aiming to return answers to Mueller\u2019s questions later this month, according to one source familiar with the matter. No final decision on an in-person interview has been made. But Trump\u2019s legal team and other lawyers representing witnesses in the investigation expect that the President\u2019s responses to Mueller could be one of the final pieces of the 18-month-long probe before the investigators present a report on their findings. Trump made clear once again in a news conference Wednesday he believes the investigation is a waste of time and money. \u201cIt\u2019s a disgrace, it should have never been started because there was no crime,\u201d Trump said. Even after Mueller completes his work, Tuesday\u2019s midterm election results mean that House Democrats will also be in a position to expand investigations of Trump. That means Mueller will not be the end of Russia-related questions of Trump and his campaign. The Stone portion of the investigation relates to one of Mueller\u2019s central responsibilities: to tell Americans whether there\u2019s evidence of collusion between Russians and people associated with the Trump campaign related to the 2016 election. Trump's replacement for Sessions once argued the Mueller probe goes too far Investigators have been circling back to Stone\u2019s associates they have already interviewed with additional questions. And at least one \u2013 author and well-known conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi \u2013 is still in discussions about potentially appearing for a second time before the Washington, DC, grand jury that Mueller has been using for the investigation. Over the last two months, Corsi has been talking to Mueller\u2019s investigators \u201cin a really constant basis,\u201d he said in a video he posted online on Monday. RELATED: Roger Stone reveals he talked to Trump campaign about WikiLeaks in 2016 On Thursday, Mueller\u2019s team is set to appear in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to defend the special counsel\u2019s authority as another one of Stone\u2019s former associates aims to quash a subpoena for grand jury testimony. Stone has denied any wrongdoing and has said he didn\u2019t have any inside knowledge about plans by WikiLeaks to publish hacked emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign stolen by Russian intelligence in the run-up to the election. Stone insists he never shared anything about WikiLeaks with then-candidate Trump. \u201cI never discussed any of this with Donald Trump,\u201d Stone told CNN recently. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the questions that Mr. Mueller wants the President to answer \u2013 one of the written questions. I\u2019m highly confident that his answer will be that he knew nothing about it. We just never discussed it.\u201d On Thursday, Stone told CNN, \u201cI never visited Trump Tower after August of 2015 until the President-elect asked me to visit him after the election.\u201d Stone said he visited just one time around late November of 2016 or early December, and that this was his last visit to Trump Tower. The conversation during that one visit was \u201cmostly congratulatory. It was innocuous. Nothing heavy.\u201d In terms of phone calls in 2016 with Trump, he says they were \u201coccasional and in all cases initiated by him. And we never discussed WikiLeaks.\u201d All signs point to an investigation that is winding down, though Mueller hasn\u2019t provided any timeline for completing his work. Even with the Mueller probe seemingly nearing its end, the Russia meddling investigation and its impact is expected to reverberate for months. The White House is seeking to hire as many as two dozen lawyers for the counsel\u2019s office, which will soon by led by Pat Cipollone, following the departure of Don McGahn, sources briefed on the search say. The legal firepower, the President\u2019s lawyers believe, will be needed as newly empowered Democrats launch a new round of probes, including pursuing parts of the Trump-Russia matter that Republican leaders had blocked. Two Roger Stone associates go before Mueller's grand jury One of the important questions the new White House legal team is expected to have to address is whether any of Mueller\u2019s findings can be shared with either Congress or the public given executive privilege concerns, which could block release of some or all of Mueller\u2019s work. Under Justice Department regulations, Mueller is required to produce a \u201cconfidential report\u201d at the end of his investigation, which includes \u201cthe prosecution or declination decisions reached by the Special Counsel.\u201d But the regulations do not require that Mueller\u2019s report be released to the public, and with Whitaker taking over, it is not clear whether he will choose to release it at all, or in what form. One of the sources familiar with the matter said the report will be detailed in part because Mueller\u2019s team wants to make sure it withstands public scrutiny. It is expected to include an analysis of the allegations, any information or statements made over the course of voluntary interviews, a legal explanation of why the evidence didn\u2019t meet the prosecution bar and an overall defense of the investigation. How much the Mueller team has accomplished remains a subject of partisan debate. Critics of the President cite guilty pleas from top Trump campaign associates, including former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and his deputy Rick Gates, as well as Michael Flynn, his first national security adviser. So far the Mueller team has brought charges against 35 people and entities, secured six guilty pleas, and prison sentences against three people. Supporters of the President argue that none of the guilty pleas, and the one court conviction, have had anything to do with the Russian interference in the 2016 election, which is what Mueller is supposed to be investigating.  The new acting-attorney general has questioned in the past whether there is any obstruction to investigate. Even inside the Justice Department, there\u2019s been second-guessing of some of the Mueller team\u2019s work. One particular focus has the Mueller team\u2019s decision earlier this year to include a Russian company among entities and people charged related to operating an internet troll farm that played a central role in Russian interference efforts in 2016. Mueller could soon roar back into the news Some Justice Department lawyers raised concerns about charging the company, for fear it could force the government to share information in discovery that could end up with the Russians. Those concerns have proven prescient in recent months as the company, Concord Management, hired US lawyers to fight the special counsel in court on a series of fronts. The Concord lawyers have won court permission to access to sensitive information used to bring the charges, though the judge has restricted what can be shared with foreign nationals. \u201cWhat a lot of people thought were vulnerabilities in the indictment are now coming to light,\u201d said one former Justice Department official. RELATED: Russian company compares Mueller to Looney Tunes The behind-the-scenes doubts were discussed among Justice Department lawyers, some of whom were consulted by the Mueller team before the charges were brought. A spokesman for the special counsel declined to comment. Russian company compares Mueller to Looney Tunes Some DOJ lawyers have groused that the Mueller team should have taken a less risky course by focusing the indictment against the Russian nationals, without the companies and entities. That\u2019s because since the individuals wouldn\u2019t likely respond to the charges and subject themselves to US legal process. Given the legal fight that has ensued, DOJ will have to handle the upcoming trial in the case and any other legal matters that arise from it, perhaps long after Mueller has wrapped up his inquiry.

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, President Donald Trump \u2013accompanied by his wife, Melania, and his daughter and son-in-law \u2013 traveled to Pittsburgh to offer condolences to the victims of a shooting at a Jewish synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood. He did so despite urgings from the city\u2019s mayor to postpone his trip until the funerals for the 11 victims could be completed. And despite the fact that no members of Congress joined him on the trip. And then, on Wednesday morning, he tweeted this: THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cMelania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful!\u201d Clearly the President has a victim mentality here. He was performing his presidential duties of mourning with those who lost loved ones and visiting with the injured but the protesters \u2013 and the media that covered them \u2013 had treated him very, very unfairly. It\u2019s a remarkable bit of myopia. And a revealing reminder that Trump not only sees absolutely everything through the lens of himself first, second and last, but also that the way he sees himself is as the unfairly maligned victim. Always. Remember the context here. Over the weekend, 11 people were gunned down in a synagogue. It was the single most deadly attack on American Jews in history. But, for Trump, the key is that some people are criticizing his visit \u2013 and covering people who protested his divisive rhetoric. His capacity to make any story about him \u2013 and to turn it into a grievance \u2013 is truly startling. And telling. The key to Trump is this: He has always viewed himself as an outsider, scorned by the \u201cin\u201d crowd but, secretly, better \u2013 smarter, richer, cooler \u2013 than all of them. Growing up, his father, Fred, was a big-time developer but in Queens, not Manhattan. Trump went into Manhattan as a developer but the established, old money crowd wouldn\u2019t let him into their clubs. (In the words of President Kanye West: \u201cI know they don\u2019t want me in the damn club/They even made me show ID to get inside of Sam\u2019s Club.\u201d) He came to Washington in 2011 amid speculation about him entering politics and the insider DC crowd laughed at him. \u201cI meet these people they call them \u2018the elite,\u2019\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally this summer. \u201cThese people. I look at them, I say, \u2018That\u2019s elite?\u2019 We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we\u2019re smarter than they are, and they say they\u2019re elite? We\u2019re the elite. You\u2019re the elite. We\u2019re the elite.\u201d That grievance-based view of the world found remarkably fertile ground among primarily white voters barraged by almost-constant economic anxiety and a growing sense that the culture in which they grew up was being eroded in front of their eyes. So great was their grievance \u2013 and sense of victimhood \u2013 that they were willing to overlook (or look past) the fact that Trump was a billionaire, who had come from significant wealth, and was living very high on the hog in New York City and Florida. Not exactly someone who shared their worries about ends meeting or paying for their kids to go to college. As President, Trump has kept up his insistence that the elites are out to get him. The best example is his ongoing battle with the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d \u2013 Trump\u2019s conceit that there is a coordinated effort within the federal bureaucracy (focused on the Justice Department) to undermine his presidency. He has repeatedly insisted that he is the target of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d being run by special counsel Robert Mueller, a probe pushed by Democrats who can\u2019t accept the results of the 2016 election. (The special counsel was created by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Mueller himself is a Republican.) This tweet from Trump is indicative of his broader view of how he is being persecuted in all of this: \u201c\u2018Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President.\u2019 @FoxNews\u201d That victim complex has also led him to take the side of high-profile men accused of sexual assault or misconduct \u2013 from Bill O\u2019Reilly to Roger Ailes to Brett Kavanaugh \u2013 all while bemoaning the allegations leveled against him by more than a dozen women over the course of the 2016 campaign. \u201cEvery woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign,\u201d Trump said in 2016. \u201cTotal fabrication. The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over.\u201d (Sidebar: He never sued any of the women.) The Point: Despite being a child of privilege, a billionaire and a man who was elected president on his first run for public office, Donald Trump always always always sees himself as an aggrieved victim. Even when 11 people were gunned down in a place of worship just days ago.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to fill the job of White House counsel is an indication the White House is preparing for possible post-election legal brawls with Democrats over everything from the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to possible impeachment if Democrats take over the House of Representatives. Pat Cipollone is taking over an office formerly led by Don McGahn, whose last day at the White House was Wednesday. While McGahn was planning on leaving the White House, his departure was expedited by Trump\u2019s Tuesday announcement of Cipollone\u2019s appointment, sources say. Should Democrats take over the House, the President\u2019s lawyers expect a flood of new oversight investigations of executive branch agencies, which the GOP-controlled Congress has largely avoided. Democrats are also expected to try to get access to materials from the Mueller investigation, which the President\u2019s lawyers argue should be protected by executive privilege. The President and his lawyers have also raised the likelihood of an impeachment battle, even though Democratic leaders have tried to avoid discussing the issue. Michael Cohen meets with prosecutors investigating Trump's family business, charity Cipollone\u2019s arrival marks an important change for the President because it means he will have a White House counsel who isn\u2019t sidelined by conflicts as a result of being a witness in the Mueller investigation. McGahn and others in his office have provided interviews to Mueller as part of the investigation into whether the President tried to obstruct the inquiry. As a result, the President had to bring on Emmet Flood as his own special counsel to handle Mueller interactions on behalf of the President\u2019s office. The relationship between Trump and McGahn was further damaged when McGahn\u2019s clashes with the President became public knowledge in news reports. Cipollone is leaving his partnership at the Washington law firm Stein Mitchell Cipollone Beato & Missner to take the White House job. But behind the scenes in recent months, he was already working as an outside adviser to the President\u2019s legal team, becoming something of a Trump whisperer, sources close to the President\u2019s legal team say. Treasury official charged with leaking docs related to Russia, Manafort \u201cHe\u2019s developed a relationship with the President,\u201d one person close to the Trump legal team told CNN. \u201cHe knows how to talk to (Trump) and \u2026 that\u2019s important.\u201d Cipollone is a seasoned litigator and former Justice Department official who served during President George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration, but he lacks extensive experience dealing with congressional investigations. The President and his legal team think that\u2019s not going to be a problem in part because Flood plans to remain in his post to help manage those interactions, according to people briefed on the matter. The President\u2019s legal team thinks Cipollone will make a good team with Flood \u201cshould things take a nasty turn in November,\u201d a person close to Trump\u2019s legal team said. Cipollone\u2019s Washington skills work well, the source said, with other members of the team led in part by Jane and Marty Raskin, Florida-based lawyers who have been leading day-to-day negotiations with the Mueller team. \u201cHe blends the legal and the political very well,\u201d the source close to the President\u2019s legal team said. Bloomberg: Rosenstein wants special counsel probe finished soon Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the President, said that after working with Cipollone over the past several months he\u2019s \u201cconfident he will build a solid team in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office.\u201d Former Obama White House counsel Neil Eggleston, who previously worked with Cipollone, said Cipollone is a \u201csolid litigator used to high stakes litigation. He\u2019s got the right temperament for the job.\u201d Eggleston said the key for Cipollone is to surround himself with top deputies who have the skills he doesn\u2019t, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t worry he\u2019s going to do that.\u201d Cipollone is expected to join the White House in the next two weeks, but he\u2019s already gotten a small taste of the unusually unscripted nature of the Trump presidency. Trump made his announcement of Cipollone in an Associated Press interview on Tuesday, which came as a surprise even to Cipollone and others in the President\u2019s legal team and the White House. While he knew he had the job, the sudden announcement wasn\u2019t part of a planned rollout as usually happens with significant personnel announcements in the White House. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately describe Democrats\u2019 expected efforts to access Mueller investigation materials.",

And you know I started off in Brooklyn, my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! While the idea of Trump portraying himself as some sort of rags-to-riches story was always laughable \u2013 his father was a man of considerable means and a $1 million loan is not exactly chump change \u2013 it convinced lots and lots of people that Trump was like them. Or, more accurately, what they aspired to be. He was \u2013 and is \u2013 for many, the living embodiment of the American dream. Which is why this story published by The New York Times on Tuesday night, which details a series of tax evasions that Trump and his father used over the years is so devastating. The piece is long and hugely detailed, but its most devastating lines \u2013 to the idea of the President as, essentially, a self-made man \u2013 are these: \u201cBy age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. By the time he was 17, his father had given him part ownership of a 52-unit apartment building. Soon after Mr. Trump graduated from college, he was receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year from his father. The money increased with the years, to more than $5 million annually in his 40s and 50s.\u201d And remember that $1 million loan Trump talked so much about on the campaign trail? The Times reports that the total loan by Fred Trump to his son, Donald, was actually $60.7 million or \u2013 and brace yourself here \u2013 $140 million in today\u2019s money. (The total amount of money Trump received from his father\u2019s holdings is estimated at more than $400 million by the Times). The truth, as laid bare by the Times reporting, which included reviewing more than 100,000 pages of financial documents, is that Donald Trump was born into a very wealthy family and through a series of complicated tax maneuvers \u2013 many of which, at best, skirted the law \u2013 was propelled upward by his father\u2019s heavy behind-the-scenes financial support. \u201cWhile Fred Trump helped finance the accouterments of wealth, Donald Trump, master self-promoter, spun them into a seductive narrative,\u201d reads the Times story. \u201cFred Trump\u2019s money, for example, helped build Trump Tower, the talisman of privilege that established his son as a major player in New York. But Donald Trump recognized and exploited the iconic power of Trump Tower as a primary stage for both \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 and his presidential campaign.\u201d New York Times investigation: Trump helped his parents evade taxes, 'including instances of outright fraud' While the White House offered no official comment to the Times for the story, they did release a statement after it published. \u201cMany decades ago the IRS reviewed and signed off on these transactions,\u201d said White House press secretary Sarah Sanders. \u201cThe New York Times\u2019 and other media outlets\u2019 credibility with the American people is at an all time low because they are consumed with attacking the president and his family 24/7 instead of reporting the news.\u201d On Wednesday morning, Trump tweeted, \u201cThe Failing New York Times did something I have never seen done before. They used the concept of \u2018time value of money\u2019 in doing a very old, boring and often told hit piece on me. Added up, this means that 97% of their stories on me are bad. Never recovered from bad election call!\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyer Charles Harder responded to the Times story in a statement,\u201dThe New York Times\u2019 allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory,\u201d Harder said, according to the paper. Trump\u2019s brother Robert also defended his parents on behalf of the President and his siblings, saying, \u201cAll appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed, and the required taxes were paid. Our father\u2019s estate was closed in 2001 by both the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State tax authorities, and our mother\u2019s estate was closed in 2004.\u201d Throughout the 2016 campaign \u2013 and into his 19 months as president \u2013 the single biggest mystery surrounding Trump was his refusal to release any of his income tax returns. In doing so, he became the first major party presidential candidate and the first president not to release any of his returns in the modern era. Trump insisted the reason he refused to release his returns was that he currently under a tax audit by the Internal Revenue Service. (Trump was not prohibited from releasing his returns because of the audit; Richard Nixon, as president, released his tax returns in 1973 even while he was being audited).   After Trump won the election, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway seemed to abandon the \u201che\u2019s under audit\u201d defense entirely. \u201cWe litigated this all through the election,\u201d Conway said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t care. They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like.\u201d It was unclear then \u2013 and is unclear now \u2013 how Conway drew the conclusions that \u201cpeople didn\u2019t care\u201d that Trump had never released even the most basic outline of his tax returns. There was no question on the 2016 exit poll that asked how much influence \u2013 if any \u2013 Trump\u2019s refusal to release his returns had on the vote. The most recent news we\u2019ve had on Trump\u2019s taxes came on Tax Day \u2013 April 17. \u201cThe President filed an extension for his 2017 tax return, as do many Americans with complex returns,\u201d Sanders said in a statement at the time. \u201cHe will file his tax return by the extension deadline of October 15, 2018.\u201d Which is in 12 days! But don\u2019t hold your breath that come October 15, Trump will suddenly reconsider his past position of non-disclosure of his taxes. (The White House\u2019s last public statement on all of this is that Trump remains under audit!) We\u2019ve long suspected that the real reason why Trump is willing to take the negative publicity that comes with his closed-book policy on his tax returns is because that story is far less damaging than what would be unleashed if Trump actually did release his taxes. The most commonly held belief was that releasing his returns would expose the fact that Trump is far less wealthy than he has long claimed. Some suggested that his tax returns might reveal ties to Russian oligarchs or banks that would fuel the idea that Trump was somehow influenced or owned by a foreign power. What the Times story makes plain is that at least one of the main reasons Trump may never release his returns \u2013 or, at least, a major reason \u2013 is that to do so would implode the myth that he pulled himself up from his bootstraps and through sheer force of will made himself into a billionaire. We now know \u2013 thanks to the remarkable reporting by the Times \u2013 that Trump\u2019s success was fueled and financed by his father\u2019s money. Which is a less inspiring \u2013 if no less American \u2013 story.",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama backed a slate of leading progressive Democrats in a second round of national endorsements released on Monday, a little more than five weeks ahead of the midterm elections. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who in June defeated incumbent Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, the fourth-ranking House Democrat in their primary, received Obama\u2019s support this time around. Her name had been absent from the first wave back on August 1, a source of frustration to some on the left. \u201cThe Democratic Party has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the American people when we lead with conviction, principle, and bold, new ideas,\u201d Obama said in a statement touting the candidates as a \u201cmovement of citizens who are younger, more diverse, more female than ever before.\u201d The 260 hopefuls backed by Obama on Monday included a number of high-profile progressives who did not make his initial list, some of them because they had not yet won their primaries. One notable omission: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. The deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee is running for state attorney general amid allegations of domestic abuse by an ex-girlfriend. He has denied the allegations. Florida Democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, was still four weeks away from his surprise primary victory when Obama rolled out his first slate of endorsement. Gillum, who was endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders before the vote, won the nomination on August 28 and is now facing off with former GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis, who resigned from the House weeks after the primary and is a fierce loyalist of President Donald Trump. \u201cAndrew believes that healthcare is a right, not a privilege, and he will make expanding Medicaid a priority on day one as governor,\u201d Obama said in a statement. Gillum, like Sanders, is a supporter of single-payer health care, but has put Medicaid expansion at the top of his to-do list if elected. Obama also announced his support for Maryland gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous, the former NAACP president and chief executive who endorsed Sanders over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary. Jealous is trailing in the polls as he seeks to oust incumbent GOP Gov. Larry Hogan and has faced some push back from some of the state\u2019s moderate Democratic establishment. \u201cBen Jealous is an accomplished civil rights leader, businessman, and advocate for working people,\u201d Obama said in a statement that touted Jealous\u2019s efforts as \u201ca social impact investor\u201d who has \u201cworked closely with small businesses, creating jobs and building a more inclusive economy.\u201d With Monday\u2019s endorsements, Obama is now backing Gillum, Jealous and Georgia\u2019s Stacey Abrams. If elected, each would become their state\u2019s first African American governor. Abrams would be the first African American woman to win the office anywhere in the US. Obama also endorsed Vermont\u2019s Christine Hallquist, who is seeking to become the country\u2019s first transgender governor. Down the ballot, Obama is now publicly backing Jahana Hayes \u2013 whom he once honored as the 2016 National Teacher of the Year \u2013 in Connecticut\u2019s 5th Congressional District, Wisconsin\u2019s 1st Congressional District House candidate Randy Bryce, another close Sanders ally, and Kara Eastman, the progressive insurgent who surprised the establishment when she beat the former \u201cBlue Dog\u201d Rep. Brad Ashford in the primary for Nebraska\u2019s 2nd Congressional District. \u201cI am honored to have President Barack Obama\u2019s endorsement!,\u201d Eastman tweeted on Monday. \u201cThis endorsement comes at a time when many Americans are eager for change. Here in #NE02 our grassroots, people-powered campaign is working every day to make that change a reality. Thank you @BarackObama!\u201d In a statement accompanying the endorsements, Obama\u2019s office explained that the former President\u2019s choices were made to highlight candidates in close races, especially those at the state-level where the outcome could have an affect on future redistricting efforts. He prioritized his own campaign and White House alumni, like Lauren Baer, a Democrat who worked as a foreign policy aide in the administration beginning in 2011 and is now running to flip Florida\u2019s 18th Congressional District. He also endorsed Rachel Crooks, who is running for a state representative seat in Ohio. Crooks accused Trump before the 2016 election of kissing her on the lips without her consent. She is one of at least 15 women to allege some kind of past sexual misconduct by the President. Trump has denied all the allegations.",

            "article_content": "WARNING: This story contains graphic language. President Donald Trump\u2019s closest aides have taken extraordinary measures in the White House to try to stop what they saw as his most dangerous impulses, going so far as to swipe and hide papers from his desk so he wouldn\u2019t sign them, according to a new book from legendary journalist Bob Woodward. Woodward\u2019s 448-page book, \u201cFear: Trump in the White House,\u201d provides an unprecedented inside-the-room look through the eyes of the President\u2019s inner circle. From the Oval Office to the Situation Room to the White House residence, Woodward uses confidential background interviews to illustrate how some of the President\u2019s top advisers view him as a danger to national security and have sought to circumvent the commander in chief. Many of the feuds and daily clashes have been well documented, but the picture painted by Trump\u2019s confidants, senior staff and Cabinet officials reveal that many of them see an even more alarming situation \u2014 worse than previously known or understood. Woodward offers a devastating portrait of a dysfunctional Trump White House, detailing how senior aides \u2014 both current and former Trump administration officials \u2014 grew exasperated with the President and increasingly worried about his erratic behavior, ignorance and penchant for lying. Chief of staff John Kelly describes Trump as an \u201cidiot\u201d and \u201cunhinged,\u201d Woodward reports. Defense Secretary James Mattis describes Trump as having the understanding of \u201ca fifth or sixth grader.\u201d And Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer John Dowd describes the President as \u201ca fucking liar,\u201d telling Trump he would end up in an \u201corange jump suit\u201d if he testified to special counsel Robert Mueller. Bob Woodward's bizarre phone call with Trump \u201cHe\u2019s an idiot. It\u2019s pointless to try to convince him of anything. He\u2019s gone off the rails. We\u2019re in crazytown,\u201d Kelly is quoted as saying at a staff meeting in his office. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I\u2019ve ever had.\u201d CNN obtained a copy of Woodward\u2019s book, scheduled for release September 11. The explosive revelations about Trump from those closest to him are likely to play into the November midterm election battle. The book also has stunning new details about Trump\u2019s obsession with the Russia probe, describing for the first time confidential conversations between the President\u2019s lawyers and Mueller. It recounts a dramatic session in the White House residence in which Trump failed a mock Mueller interview with his lawyers. In separate statements Tuesday afternoon, Kelly denied that he called Trump an \u201cidiot,\u201d Dowd denied using the \u201corange jump suit\u201d phrase and Mattis said the quotes attributed to him were \u201ca product of someone\u2019s rich imagination.\u201d The White House accused Woodward of spreading \u201cfabricated stories\u201d about Trump. \u201cThis book is nothing more than fabricated stories, many by former disgruntled employees, told to make the President look bad,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. \u201cWhile it is not always pretty, and rare that the press actually covers it, President Trump has broken through the bureaucratic process to deliver unprecedented successes for the American people. Sometimes it is unconventional, but he always gets results.\u201d Woodward, however, said he stood by his reporting in a statement obtained by CNN. He sums up the state of the Trump White House by writing that Trump was an \u201cemotionally overwrought, mercurial and unpredictable leader.\u201d Woodward writes that the staff\u2019s decision to circumvent the President was \u201ca nervous breakdown of the executive power of the most powerful country in the world.\u201d The book opens with a dramatic scene. Former chief economic adviser Gary Cohn saw a draft letter he considered dangerous to national security on the Oval Office desk. The letter would have withdrawn the US from a critical trade agreement with South Korea. Trump\u2019s aides feared the fallout could jeopardize a top-secret national security program: the ability to detect a North Korean missile launch within just seven seconds. Woodward reports Cohn was \u201cappalled\u201d that Trump might sign the letter. \u201cI stole it off his desk,\u201d Cohn told an associate. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let him see it. He\u2019s never going to see that document. Got to protect the country.\u201d Cohn was not alone. Former staff secretary Rob Porter worked with Cohn and used the same tactic on multiple occasions, Woodward writes. In addition to literally stealing or hiding documents from Trump\u2019s desk, they sought to stall and delay decisions or distract Trump from orders they thought would endanger national security. \u201cA third of my job was trying to react to some of the really dangerous ideas that he had and try to give him reasons to believe that maybe they weren\u2019t such good ideas,\u201d said Porter, who as staff secretary handled the flow of presidential papers until he quit amid domestic violence allegations. He and others acted with the acquiescence of former chief of staff Reince Priebus, Woodward reports. Woodward describes repeated attempts to bypass Trump as \u201cno less than an administrative coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.\u201d Woodward\u2019s book relies on hundreds of hours of taped interviews and dozens of sources in Trump\u2019s inner circle, as well as documents, files, diaries and memos, including a note handwritten by Trump himself. Woodward explains that he talked with sources on \u201cdeep background,\u201d meaning he could use all the information but not say who provided it. His reporting comes with the credibility of a long and storied history that separates this book from previous efforts on Trump. The author and Washington Post journalist has won two Pulitzer Prizes, including one for his coverage of the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. In one revelatory anecdote, Woodward describes a scene in the White House residence. Trump\u2019s lawyer, convinced the President would perjure himself, put Trump through a test \u2014 a practice interview for the one he might have with Mueller. Trump failed, according to Dowd, but the President still insisted he should testify. Cillizza: Bob Woodward's peek behind the Trump curtain is 100% as terrifying as we feared Woodward writes that Dowd saw the \u201cfull nightmare\u201d of a potential Mueller interview, and felt Trump acted like an \u201caggrieved Shakespearean king.\u201d But Trump seemed surprised at Dowd\u2019s reaction, Woodward writes. \u201cYou think I was struggling?\u201d Trump asked. Then, in an even more remarkable move, Dowd and Trump\u2019s current personal attorney Jay Sekulow went to Mueller\u2019s office and re-enacted the mock interview. Their goal: to argue that Trump couldn\u2019t possibly testify because he was incapable of telling the truth. \u201cHe just made something up. That\u2019s his nature,\u201d Dowd said to Mueller. The passage is an unprecedented glimpse behind the scenes of Mueller\u2019s secretive operation \u2014 for the first time, Mueller\u2019s conversations with Trump\u2019s lawyers are captured. \u201cI need the president\u2019s testimony,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cWhat was his intent on Comey? \u2026 I want to see if there was corrupt intent.\u201d Despite Dowd\u2019s efforts, Trump continued to insist he could testify. \u201cI think the President of the United States cannot be seen taking the fifth,\u201d Trump said. Dowd\u2019s argument was stark: \u201cThere\u2019s no way you can get through these. \u2026 Don\u2019t testify. It\u2019s either that or an orange jump suit.\u201d What he couldn\u2019t say to Trump, according to Woodward, was what Dowd believed to be true: \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking liar.\u201d In a statement Tuesday, Dowd denied some of the key anecdotes and quotes attributed to him in the book. He criticized Woodward for fueling an \u201cendless cycle of accusations and misrepresentation.\u201d \u201cI do not intend to address every inaccurate statement attributed to me \u2013 but I do want to make this clear: there was no so-called \u2018practice session\u2019 or \u2018re-enactment\u2019 of a mock interview at the Special Counsel\u2019s office,\u201d Dowd said. \u201cFurther, I did not refer to the President as a \u2018liar\u2019 and did not say that he was likely to end up in an \u2018orange jump suit\u2019. It was a great honor and distinct privilege to serve President Trump.\u201d Throughout the book, Woodward portrays the President as a man obsessed with his standing in the media and with his core supporters. Trump appears to be lonely and increasingly paranoid, often watching hours of television in the White House residence. \u201cThey\u2019re out to get me,\u201d Trump said of Mueller\u2019s team. Trump\u2019s closest advisers described him erupting in rage and profanity, and he seemed to enjoy humiliating others. \u201cThis guy is mentally retarded,\u201d Trump said of Sessions. \u201cHe\u2019s this dumb southerner,\u201d Trump told Porter, mocking Sessions by feigning a southern accent. Trump said that Priebus is \u201clike a little rat. He just scurries around.\u201d And Trump demeaned former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani to his face, when Giuliani was the only campaign surrogate willing to defend then-candidate Trump on television after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, a bombshell video where Trump described sexually assaulting women. Bob Woodward's new book puts readers 'face to face with Trump' \u201cRudy, you\u2019re a baby,\u201d Trump told the man who is now his attorney. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a worse defense of me in my life. They took your diaper off right there. You\u2019re like a little baby that needed to be changed. When are you going to be a man?\u201d Trump\u2019s predecessors are not spared either. In a conversation with Sen. Lindsey Graham, Trump called President Barack Obama a \u201cweak dick\u201d for not acting in Syria, Woodward reports. Woodward\u2019s book takes readers inside top-secret meetings. On July 27, 2017, Trump\u2019s national security leaders convened a gathering at \u201cThe Tank\u201d in the Pentagon. The goal: an intervention to try to educate the President on the importance of allies and diplomacy. Trump\u2019s philosophy on diplomacy was personal. \u201cThis is all about leader versus leader. Man versus man. Me versus Kim,\u201d he said of North Korea. His inner circle was worried about \u201cThe Big Problem,\u201d Woodward writes: Trump\u2019s lack of understanding that his crusade to impose tariffs could endanger global security. But the meeting didn\u2019t go as planned. Trump went off on his generals. \u201cYou should be killing guys. You don\u2019t need a strategy to kill people,\u201d Trump said of Afghanistan. He questioned the wisdom of keeping US troops in South Korea. \u201cSo Mr. President,\u201d Cohn said to Trump, \u201cwhat would you need in the region to sleep well at night?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need a fucking thing,\u201d the President said. \u201cAnd I\u2019d sleep like a baby.\u201d After Trump left the Tank, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declared: \u201cHe\u2019s a fucking moron.\u201d The book provides the context for the now-infamous quote that marked the beginning of the end for Tillerson\u2019s tenure. Tillerson tried to downplay the dispute \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not going to deal with petty stuff like that,\u201d he said at a news conference after NBC reported the remark \u2014 but he was ultimately fired via tweet. Woodward also quotes an unnamed White House official who gave an even more dire assessment of the meeting: \u201cIt seems clear that many of the president\u2019s senior advisers, especially those in the national security realm, are extremely concerned with his erratic nature, his relative ignorance, his inability to learn, as well as what they consider his dangerous views.\u201d A recurrent theme in Woodward\u2019s book is Trump\u2019s seeming disregard for national security concerns because of his obsession with money \u2014 trade deficits and the cost of troops overseas. In meeting after meeting, Trump questions why the US has to pay for such a large troop presence in South Korea. \u201cWe\u2019re doing this in order to prevent World War III,\u201d Mattis, the defense secretary, bluntly explained to Trump at one January 2018 meeting, which prompted Mattis to tell close associates afterward that Trump had the understanding of a \u201cfifth or sixth grader.\u201d Trump still wasn\u2019t convinced. \u201cI think we could be so rich if we weren\u2019t stupid,\u201d he later said in the meeting, arguing the US was being played as \u201csuckers,\u201d Woodward reports. Trump\u2019s tweets \u2014 and his infatuation with Twitter \u2014 are a theme throughout the book. Woodward reveals that Trump ordered printouts of his tweets and studied them to find out which ones were most popular. \u201cThe most effective tweets were often the most shocking,\u201d Woodward writes. Twitter was a source of great consternation for national security leaders, who feared \u2014 and warned Trump \u2014 \u201cTwitter could get us into a war.\u201d Appalled by some of his more outrageous posts, Trump\u2019s aides tried to form a Twitter \u201ccommittee\u201d to vet the President\u2019s tweets, but they failed to stop their boss. Priebus, who was blindsided when Trump announced his firing on Twitter, referred to the presidential bedroom as \u201cthe devil\u2019s workshop\u201d and called the early morning hours and Sunday night \u2014 a time of many news-breaking tweets \u2014 \u201cthe witching hour.\u201d Trump, however, saw himself as a Twitter wordsmith. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing,\u201d Trump said when Twitter expanded its character count to 280, \u201cbut it\u2019s a bit of a shame because I was the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters.\u201d Finally, \u201cFear\u201d is filled with slights, insults and takedowns from both family and staff that speak to the chaos, infighting and drama that Trump allows to fester around him. Both Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump are targeted by the inner circle. There is a pointed shot at Ivanka from the President\u2019s now-ostracized chief strategist Steve Bannon, who frequently clashed with the first daughter and her husband. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a fucking staffer!\u201d Bannon screamed at Ivanka at a staff meeting, according to Woodward. \u201cYou walk around this place and act like you\u2019re in charge, and you\u2019re not. You\u2019re on staff!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a staffer!\u201d she shouted back. \u201cI\u2019ll never be a staffer. I\u2019m the first daughter\u201d \u2014 she really used the title, Woodward writes \u2014 \u201cand I\u2019m never going to be a staffer!\u201d Two of the harshest comments in the book are directed at Trump and come from his chiefs of staff. After Trump\u2019s Charlottesville, Virginia, controversy, in which he failed to condemn white supremacists, Cohn tried to resign but was instead dressed down by Trump and accused of \u201ctreason.\u201d Kelly, who is Trump\u2019s current chief of staff, told Cohn afterward, according to notes Cohn made of the exchange: \u201cIf that was me, I would have taken that resignation letter and shoved it up his ass six different times.\u201d And Priebus, Trump\u2019s first chief of staff, encapsulated the White House and the thrust of Woodward\u2019s book by describing the administration as a place with \u201cnatural predators at the table.\u201d \u201cWhen you put a snake and a rat and a falcon and a rabbit and a shark and a seal in a zoo without walls,\u201d Priebus is quoted as saying, \u201cthings start getting nasty and bloody.\u201d UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect Mattis\u2019 and the White House\u2019s responses to Woodward\u2019s book, as well as Woodward\u2019s defense of his reporting.

            "article_content": "Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week offers senators their only real opportunity to challenge the Supreme Court nominee\u2019s legal thinking before he would take a lifetime appointment on America\u2019s highest court.  This time around, the stakes are higher because President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee is poised to succeed swing vote Justice Anthony Kennedy, the conservative-centrist who joined with liberals to uphold Roe v. Wade and abortion rights. Kennedy was also the decisive vote for same-sex marriage and university affirmative action. But if past confirmation hearings are any lesson, Kavanaugh, previously a top aide to President George W. Bush, will try to reveal as little as possible while being as pleasant as possible. Here\u2019s what to watch for this week: Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election remains at the forefront of the political arena, and this will be no exception. The Supreme Court could ultimately resolve disputes arising from that investigation, and senators have said they will ask Kavanaugh about his views of executive power and when the president can be subject to investigation and indictment. How Don McGahn helped ensure Donald Trump's legacy Kavanaugh knows a thing or two about investigating a president. He worked as a deputy to independent counsel Ken Starr, going after President Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Back then, in a memo, he explained why he felt it was necessary to get Clinton to answer questions under oath about White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In the memo, he suggested that the American people and Congress needed to know the full extent of the President\u2019s wrongdoing. But after serving in the Bush White House, his thinking about pursuing a president seems to have evolved. In 2009, he wrote that having seen how \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u201d the job was, he thought it was \u201cvital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.\u201d He proposed that any criminal or civil claims against a president be deferred until he left office. \u201c(T)he indictment and trial of a sitting president,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in a 2009 law review, \u201cwould cripple the federal government, rendering it unable to function with credibility in either the international or domestic arenas.\u201d For Democrats, health care is a possible way to win political points for the upcoming midterm elections at the hearings. Democrats have said they worry that Kavanaugh would move to strike down popular provisions, such as the requirement that insurers cover everyone regardless of medical history and do not charge more for people with certain health conditions. \u201cI think this becomes the narrative of his nomination, which could bring it down,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, according to the Los Angeles Times. \u201cIf people realize that their insurance is at risk because of this court nominee, I think there is going to be a lot of pressure put on a lot of people to vote no.\u201d Kavanaugh's Obamacare rulings under microscope as he meets Manchin Trump has long criticized the 2010 Affordable Care Act and targeted Chief Justice John Roberts for his crucial fifth vote to uphold the law in 2012. \u201cIf I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush\u2019s appointee John Roberts on Obamacare,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2015. When a DC Circuit panel upheld the ACA in 2011, Kavanaugh dissented on procedural grounds, rather than assessing the merits. He said it was premature to resolve a dispute that involved an insurance mandate to be imposed in 2014, with a tax penalty the following year. Yet as he dissented, Kavanaugh laid out limits on Congress\u2019 power to regulate commerce. The crux of the litigation at that point was whether Congress could order people to buy a product, that is, health insurance. The Trump administration has vigorously worked to eliminate regulations on business, for example, in the workplace and over the environment. White House Counsel Don McGahn has said the administration has screened judicial candidates for an anti-regulatory focus. What the case of a killer whale tells us about Brett Kavanaugh Kavanaugh\u2019s thinking has been in sync with the administration. He has argued that regulatory agencies should exercise authority only when it is clearly spelled out in federal statutes, departing from the judicial practice of deferring to agency interpretations of an open-ended law. In one 2014 dispute, Kavanaugh criticized a Labor Department move to sanction SeaWorld following the drowning of a trainer by the orca Tilikum, declaring that the agency had \u201cstormed headlong into a new regulatory arena.\u201d More broadly, Kavanaugh has questioned an entrenched 1984 Supreme Court case, Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, that says judges should defer to agency interpretations of ambiguous laws. That, Kavanaugh said in a 2017 speech, \u201cencourages agency aggressiveness on a large scale.\u201d Senators will ask Kavanaugh the same question that has come up in almost every modern-day confirmation hearing: Does he think Roe v. Wade, the 1973 opinion that legalized abortion, was wrongly decided and should be overturned? Why saying Roe v. Wade is 'settled' isn't saying much The opinion is more than 40 years old, but it is still a flashpoint and opponents of abortion believe that Kavanaugh will deliver a fifth vote to either overturn Roe or cripple it. Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican who supports abortion rights, met with Kavanaugh last month and seemed satisfied that he will respect Roe. She said he\u2019d called it \u201csettled law\u201d during their meeting. But while lower court judges must abide by Supreme Court precedent, a Supreme Court justice has the latitude to try to reverse it. Supporters of abortion rights fear the worst, and Democratic senators will push him on the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for Brett Kavanaugh to say that Roe is \u2018settled law,\u2019 \u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, said in a tweet after Collins\u2019 comments. \u201cChief Justice Roberts said the same thing in 2005. Then he voted in favor of a law that would have forced 75% of Texas clinics to close. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.\u201d Friday evening, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley was informed that the White House would withhold some 100,000 documents concerning Kavanaugh\u2019s record because administration lawyers believe the documents are covered by constitutional privilege. The disclosure infuriated Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, who called it the \u201cFriday Night Document Massacre.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s decision to step in at the last moment and hide 100,000 pages of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s records from the American public is not only unprecedented in the history of Supreme Court nominations, it has all the makings of a cover-up,\u201d he said. For Kavanaugh, a 'formative' job; but for senators, few records are available Grassley, an Iowa Republican, is refusing to supply records from Kavanaugh\u2019s years as Bush\u2019s staff secretary. On top of that, there are some documents that lawyers for Trump and the White House have  labeled \u201ccommittee confidential.\u201d Democrats say Grassley has deviated from the normal protocols concerning document delivery. Grassley\u2019s office responds that he\u2019s made hundreds of thousands of documents available, and that Kavanaugh has issued more than 300 opinions that offer the best view of his jurisprudence. Kavanaugh was a law clerk to Judge Alex Kozinski from 1991 to 1992 and has remained close to his former boss through the years. When Kavanaugh was nominated to the DC Circuit, Kozinski testified on his behalf at 2006 hearings, and Kavanaugh returned the praise and thanked him for helping his career. Senators unhappy with judiciary's response to harassment in courthouses Kozinski, who had sat on the California-based 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals since 1985, stepped down in December after numerous women accused him of sexual harassment. The federal judiciary dropped its investigation of Kozinski once he resigned. As part of that episode, the Senate panel already has scrutinized the judiciary\u2019s misconduct policies, and Democrats are likely to ask what Kavanaugh knew of Kozinski\u2019s behavior as they raise broader sexual-harassment concerns. The White House issued a statement in July saying that Kavanaugh was never aware of allegations of sexual misconduct against his longtime mentor: \u201cJudge Kavanaugh clerked for Alex Kozinski more than 25 years ago. Prior to the public reports late last year, Judge Kavanaugh had never heard any allegations of sexual misconduct or sexual harassment by Judge Kozinski.\u201d During several hearings for lower court judges, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, has asked nominees whether they believe that the landmark civil rights opinion Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine in public schools, was correctly decided. Wendy Vitter, a general counsel for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans who was nominated to a district court, said she didn\u2019t mean to be \u201ccoy\u201d but that she thought it inappropriate to comment on Supreme Court decisions, \u201cwhich are correctly decided and which I may disagree with.\u201d Her comments triggered outrage. Kavanaugh knows this question is likely coming, and there\u2019s nothing in his record to suggest he would question the validity of Brown. When Roberts was asked this in 2005, he said: \u201cThe genius of the decision was the recognition that the act of separating students was where the violation was. And it rejected the defense \u2013 certainly just a theoretical one given the actual record \u2013 that you could have equal facilities and equal treatment.\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia, for his part, way back in 1986, wouldn\u2019t even answer whether Marbury v. Madison, the 1803 opinion that asserted the power of judicial review, had been correctly decided. \u201cI don\u2019t think I should answer questions regarding any specific Supreme Court opinion, even one as fundamental as Marbury v. Madison,\u201d Scalia said. But he told senators he \u201cought to be in trouble\u201d if they were to uncover anything he\u2019d written disregarding the opinion, \u201cwithout you asking me specifically about my views.\u201d Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, is ready to pounce on Kavanaugh, because the senator believes that 12 years ago, when Kavanaugh appeared before the Judiciary Committee as a nominee for a powerful appeals court, his testimony was misleading when it came to issues stemming from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. At the time Kavanaugh said, \u201cI was not involved and am not involved in the questions about the rules governing detention of combatants.\u201d Once he was confirmed, however, a Washington Post story recounted how Kavanaugh had participated in a meeting at the White House concerning whether enemy combatants should have access to lawyers. Durbin shot off an angry letter to the judge and said he\u2019d been misled. But supporters of Kavanaugh say that while he may have participated in discussions regarding whether detainees should have the ability to consult with lawyers, he never participated in broader issues related to detainee treatment. Kavanaugh\u2019s White House boss at the time, Alberto Gonzales, said in a recent statement that only a \u201climited number of personnel\u201d were read into the sensitive legal issues surrounding the authorization of the use of enhanced interrogation techniques on high value detainees. Back in 1999, Kavanaugh said the landmark opinion that ordered President Richard Nixon to turn over White House recordings toward the end of the Watergate investigation might have been \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d The comments, made as part of an interview in Washington Lawyer magazine, were included in the thousands of pages of documents released by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The White House was quick to point to a more recent speech in which Kavanaugh praised the 1974 ruling, which rejected Nixon\u2019s claim of executive privilege to withhold the tapes. It was unclear if Kavanaugh had had a change of heart. But in the age of Trump, whose 2016 campaign is under investigation, Democrats are sure to seek clarification from Kavanaugh. John Dean, Nixon\u2019s former White House counsel, is scheduled to testify Friday. Another topic from Kavanaugh\u2019s time with Starr would be his role as a co-author of the 1998 report that laid out grounds for Clinton\u2019s impeachment along with explicit details of sexual encounters between Clinton and Lewinsky. Kavanaugh also proposed hard-hitting, sexually charged questions as the Starr team was preparing to interview Clinton before a grand jury. When Starr, Kavanaugh were worried about a Clinton pardon \u201cThe President has disgraced his Office, the legal system, and the American people by having sex with a 22-year-old intern and turning her life into a shambles \u2013 callous and disgusting behavior that has somehow gotten lost in the shuffle,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote in an Aug. 15, 1998, memo to Starr and other lawyers. Kavanaugh has expressed regret that the whole steamy report was publicly released but defended the vigor with which the Starr team pursued Clinton, who was impeached by the House of Representatives and acquitted by the Senate.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump said Wednesday that Don McGahn will leave his job as White House counsel this fall following Supreme Court Justice nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. \u201cWhite House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service!\u201d Trump tweeted. McGahn\u2019s departure will close the book on a tumultuous relationship that has been both a boon for Trump\u2019s agenda and a test of the limits of Trump\u2019s executive authority. McGahn has been the key architect of Trump\u2019s successful efforts to reshape the federal courts \u2013 sealing a lasting part of Trump\u2019s conservative legacy \u2013 but he has also repeatedly clashed with the President over his attempts to interfere in the Justice Department\u2019s investigation of Russian interference and any collusion with the Trump campaign. Yes, Don McGahn leaving the White House is a very big deal That strained relationship once again resurfaced earlier this month with the disclosure that McGahn has cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, participating in several interviews spanning 30 hours over the last nine months. The conversations unnerved Trump, who didn\u2019t know the full extent of McGahn\u2019s discussions, two people familiar with his thinking said. Following the announcement of McGahn\u2019s departure, Trump told reporters Wednesday afternoon that McGahn is a \u201cvery good man.\u201d \u201cBeen here now it\u2019ll be almost two years, and a lot of affection for Don,\u201d he said, adding that McGahn will \u201cprobably\u201d be moving on to the private sector and that \u201che\u2019s done an excellent job.\u201d Asked by CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta whether he was concerned about what McGahn said to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, Trump said, \u201cNo,\u201d adding that he \u201cknew\u201d McGahn was going to talk to Mueller. \u201cWe didn\u2019t claim executive (privilege). We do everything straight. We do everything by the book and Don is an excellent guy,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s announcement comes as Mueller\u2019s investigation continues to consume much of the President\u2019s focus amid questions of potential obstruction of justice into the investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. But McGahn\u2019s departure was anticipated before the disclosure of his extensive cooperation with Mueller\u2019s team. Earlier this month, sources close to the White House said McGahn was likely to leave his White House post after Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation \u2013 with McGahn hoping to first notch a second successful Supreme Court nomination. Emmet Flood, who now directs the Russia legal strategy from inside the White House, is a potential replacement, CNN reported last week. McGahn fought to bring Flood onto the team and likes him very much, a source close to the White House said. The plan to have Flood to replace McGahn as White House counsel has been in place since Flood arrived at the White House, a source familiar with the White House legal team told CNN. The source said McGahn\u2019s departure should surprise no one, adding that McGahn has not had a good relationship with the President for more than a year. White House chief of staff John Kelly would bring McGahn into critical meetings with Trump just to keep him in the loop, the source said, adding that it was known inside the White House that McGahn threatened to resign at one point to keep the President from firing Mueller. As for why Trump doesn\u2019t just fire McGahn, this source said it\u2019s typical, noting that the President \u201cwhines\u201d about people but doesn\u2019t fire them, such as Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The news of McGahn\u2019s eventual departure comes amid the advancement of Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation hearing, which is set to start in less than a week and last three or four days, according to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley. McGahn leaves his White House post after serving as White House counsel through the tumultuous first 18 months of Trump\u2019s presidency, steering the White House\u2019s handling of the Russia investigation and responding internally to the President\u2019s mercurial moods as the investigation ballooned. His departure marks the latest of the handful of top aides who worked on the Trump campaign before joining the White House. McGahn served as the Trump campaign\u2019s top attorney throughout the GOP primary and 2016 presidential election, becoming a trusted adviser to the future president in the process. He immediately faced controversy in his earliest days at the White House, beginning with acting Attorney General Sally Yates\u2019 warning to McGahn that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn could be blackmailed by Russia and that he had likely lied to Vice President Mike Pence. Flynn was forced to resign after reports revealed Yates\u2019 warning to McGahn about Flynn\u2019s conduct. As the Justice Department and congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election heated up, McGahn found himself increasingly at the center of Trump\u2019s and the White House\u2019s response to the investigation. Yes, Don McGahn leaving the White House is a very big deal And when Attorney General Jeff Sessions faced pressure to recuse himself, Trump enlisted McGahn to urge Sessions not to take that step. Se  ssions eventually did recuse himself, giving his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, the ultimate authority to appoint a special counsel. But for McGahn, the President\u2019s order to fire Mueller was a bridge too far \u2013 with the White House counsel refusing to follow through on the order, a person familiar with the matter told CNN. The New York Times first reported Trump\u2019s move to fire Mueller and McGahn\u2019s refusal to carry out the order. The slew of incidents involving the President and McGahn amid the Russia investigation made the White House counsel an important witness in Mueller\u2019s investigation. Before joining the Trump campaign and the White House, McGahn worked at the powerful DC law firm Jones Day and previously served as a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission. McGahn also earned the trust and respect of key Republicans on Capitol Hill. As the latest reports about McGahn\u2019s likely departure emerged Wednesday morning, Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, tweeted to the President. \u201cI hope it\u2019s not true McGahn is leaving WhiteHouse (sic) Counsel. U can\u2019t let that happen,\u201d he tweeted at Trump. But he was too late. Twenty-three minutes earlier, Trump had tweeted the announcement of McGahn\u2019s planned exit.

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump may no longer control his fate, a plight that helps explain his increasingly volcanic Twitter eruptions. Trump\u2019s persona \u2013 in politics, business and life \u2013 relies on his self-image as the guy who calls the shots, closes deals and forces others to react to the shock moves of a master narrative weaver. But as a legal web closes around the President, he\u2019s in a far weaker position than he would like, a situation especially underlined by the bombshell revelations that White House counsel Donald McGahn has spent 30 hours in interviews with special counsel Robert Mueller. RELATED: Sources: Trump unsettled by McGahn\u2019s 30 hours with the special counsel Trump reacted to a media frenzy over the McGahn revelations in characteristic fashion: by launching a new Twitter assault on Mueller, taking new shots at his new nemesis John Brennan and diverting attention with newsy comments on the Federal Reserve. But sources told CNN on Monday that the President was unsettled that he didn\u2019t know the full extent of McGahn\u2019s testimony and had remained agitated through the weekend, believing the latest developments made him look weak. McGahn\u2019s conversations with Mueller are not the only drama that is leaving Trump waiting on events, rather than dictating them. Prosecutors and jurors over whom he has little control, the legal exposure of some of his top former associates and the surprising constraints of the most powerful job in the world and those who serve him are leaving him \u2013 for once \u2013 struggling to control his own story. Trump is on tenterhooks, for instance, as a jury \u2013 now entering its fourth day of deliberations \u2013 weighs tax and fraud charges that could send Paul Manafort, his onetime campaign chairman, to jail for life. Manafort jury ends third day without a verdict New reports on Sunday that Michael Cohen is close to being charged in his own multimillion-dollar alleged fraud case ignited fresh speculation over whether the President\u2019s former personal lawyer could do a deal with prosecutors to testify against his former top client. Then there is his duel with Mueller himself, who may be the most inscrutable, immovable foe Trump has ever faced. The President has often raised fears that he could try to have Mueller removed or otherwise interfere with his investigation. But the consequences of derailing a criminal probe into the conduct of his own campaign would cause a crisis of governance in Washington and could so shift the political terrain that even Republicans who have given the President a free pass could be forced to confront him. Still, on Monday Trump was still mulling the idea of a shock move \u2013 or at least he wanted the special counsel, his own supporters and other Americans to think he might try something unthinkable. \u201cI\u2019ve decided to stay out. Now, I don\u2019t have to stay out, as you know. I can go in and I could \u2026 do whatever, I could run it if I want,\u201d Trump told Reuters in an interview, speaking about the Mueller investigation. After the McGahn news detonated, Trump \u2013 as he often does when apparently caught off guard \u2013 took pains to create an impression that he was in control. He tweeted on Sunday that he had engineered McGahn\u2019s testimony because he had nothing to hide and rejected commentary that the White House counsel may have turned on him. Of course, the President could be completely genuine in his comments if he has done nothing wrong. But many legal analysts saw the new details over the length and extent of McGahn\u2019s discussions with Mueller as a serious development that could have all sorts of implications down the road. \u201cI think the White House should be very concerned about it,\u201d CNN Legal Analyst Ross Garber said. \u201cThe notion that the White House counsel \u2013 the senior lawyer for the presidency \u2013 was in cooperation with federal investigators and that the President and the chief of staff and others around the President don\u2019t know what he said \u2013 that is troubling.\u201d Powerless to do much else, Trump fired off wild tweeting sprees, in deflection mode, accusing Mueller of perpetrating McCarthyism and taking new swipes at Brennan. \u201cHe won\u2019t sue!\u201d Trump predicted in a tweet that branded Brennan \u201cthe worst CIA Director in our country\u2019s history,\u201d days after stripping him of his security clearance. And on Monday the President tweeted: \u201cDisgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel (sic), only with my approval, for purposes of transparency. Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone \u2026 looking for trouble.\u201d But it\u2019s becoming clear that Trump\u2019s immediate and ultimate destiny cannot be dictated by a tweet storm or by taking vengeance against an enemy like Brennan \u2013 a tried and trusted tactic in a political arsenal that often relies on elevating and then dismembering a foil. Other than wielding pre-emptive pardons for former aides that could ignite a constitutional showdown or launching purges of top judicial authorities handling various cases that are drawing him into a deeper legal morass, there is not much the President can do to help himself. That\u2019s partly down to Mueller. For all his increasingly poisonous insults, claims by his lawyer Rudy Giuliani that the special counsel is \u201cpanicking\u201d and the assault by his allies in conservative media, Trump has failed to draw the tight-lipped special counsel into the kind of confrontation that favors him. Reuters: Trump concerned about perjury trap in interview with special counsel And for all Giuliani\u2019s demands for Mueller to release his \u201creport\u201d and the political jockeying by Trump\u2019s legal team over a potential interview of the President by the special counsel, the taciturn investigator appears to hold all the cards. No one, least of all the President, can be sure exactly what Mueller knows about key issues like the firing of former FBI Director James Comey, the events that led up to the departure of indicted former national security adviser Michael Flynn or obstruction of justice allegations. And given the tight clamp the special counsel has imposed on his probe, it is anyone\u2019s guess whether Mueller will file a report, what it will say and when he might make his conclusions public. While Trump\u2019s team appears to be trying to make the probe a midterm election rallying call for his political base, it\u2019s also unclear whether the special counsel will make any new indictments, issue a subpoena for the President\u2019s testimony or take any other significant steps before November. All that is a serious disadvantage for Trump\u2019s legal and political team as it games out a possible defense. As a zealous litigant during his business career, Trump was used to having lawyers ready to jump at his barked commands. But he\u2019s found that things are different for a president, a reality underscored by the McGahn episode. Because McGahn serves as White House counsel, his primary duty is not limiting Trump\u2019s legal liabilities but to the office of the presidency itself, a distinction that has left some experts wondering why the President did not invoke executive privilege to delay or limit McGahn\u2019s testimony. Even then, there might not have been much Trump could have done, given the realities of McGahn\u2019s role and the fact that he is not the President\u2019s personal attorney. \u201cHe works for the people of the United States, and there is a very limited scope to the confidentiality of his discussions with the President, especially when they involve conduct that might be legitimately the subject of criminal investigation,\u201d Paul Rosenzweig, a former senior counsel to Bill Clinton independent counsel Kenneth Starr, told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin. \u201cHe simply has that obligation as a servant of the American people who works for us, in effect.\u201d John Dean: 'I think Trump has got a real problem' after McGahn's interviews with Mueller Trump\u2019s frustration over the constraints of his role and the obligations of those who serve him has long simmered in his relationship with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Trump has repeatedly slammed the former Alabama senator for recusing himself from the Russia probe; in other words, protecting not the President but his duty to justice and good governance. It may not be much longer before Trump feels the same way about McGahn. The President is also all but powerless in another legal drama that has huge implications. Like the rest of Washington, he was back in a waiting game as the jury in the Manafort trial in Alexandria, Virginia, slogged through a third day of deliberations Monday. Should it return a guilty verdict, it would hand a first, significant victory to Mueller\u2019s team and deal a symbolic blow to Trump, offering new evidence to critics who say he surrounded himself with corrupt characters from his former life. The President, despite repeated warnings from his cheerleaders on Fox News opinion shows that the Manafort trial has nothing to do with him, has shown by a string of tweets that he is watching the trial closely. But he cannot do much more than hope that it turns out well for Manafort, though on Friday he did call the trial \u201cvery sad\u201d and his former campaign chairman \u201ca very good person\u201d in comments seen by some legal experts as an effort to influence a jury that was not sequestered. Until the jury returns its verdict, the depth of Cohen\u2019s legal woes becomes clear and the inscrutable Mueller makes a significant move, Trump can only wait. And tweet. He is going to have to get used to not being in control. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Diamond, Kaitlan Collins and Kevin Liptak contributed to this article.",

            "article_content": "White House counsel Don McGahn\u2019s attorney did not give President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a full accounting of McGahn\u2019s interviews with the special counsel\u2019s team, a person familiar with the matter tells CNN. Trump\u2019s attorneys did not ask for a complete debriefing, the person said. During his three interviews with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team, McGahn did not provide information that would be incriminating to the President, a source told CNN. The New York Times first reported Sunday that Trump\u2019s legal team does not know the extent to which McGahn has been cooperating with special counsel Robert Mueller. The news follows a Saturday report by the Times that McGahn had been cooperating with Mueller extensively. The President\u2019s lawyers told the Times on Sunday that they believed that McGahn\u2019s nearly 30 hours of interviews with the special counsel had not included any testimony harmful to the President. The President\u2019s advisers are now concerned McGahn\u2019s statements to the special counsel could be key to filling in some blanks of Mueller\u2019s report, two people familiar with the discussion told the Times. According to the Times\u2019 Saturday report, McGahn\u2019s decision to cooperate was partly due to the fact that the President\u2019s initial legal team had decided to fully cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, believing their client had nothing to hide and that they could bring a quick end to the probe. McGahn and his attorney, William Burck, became concerned that the President planned to set him up to be held responsible for any potential illegal incidents of obstruction, the Times reported, so the White House counsel and his attorney came up with a strategy to cooperate as extensively as possible with the special counsel in order to prove that there was no wrongdoing by McGahn, the newspaper reported. When contacted by CNN, Burck declined to comment on the Times\u2019 report on Sunday. Burck said in a statement Saturday, \u201cPresident Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn\u2019s testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team\u2019s questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must.\u201d Trump\u2019s former lead personal attorney, John Dowd, who supported the idea of White House officials cooperating with the Mueller probe, told CNN on Sunday that McGahn \u201cwas a strong witness for the President\u2019s case. The strategy is working. Ask Rudy,\u201d a reference to Trump\u2019s current lead lawyer in the special counsel investigation, Rudy Giuliani. \u201cWe protected [the President] by not asserting attorney-client privilege,\u201d Dowd added, saying that if Trump\u2019s legal team had not allowed for White House officials like McGahn to undergo voluntary interviews with Mueller\u2019s team, then they would have been called to testify before a grand jury.\u201d Giuliani said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday morning that he had not debriefed McGahn, but nevertheless the legal team had \u201ca good sense\u201d of what McGahn told Mueller\u2019s team through Dowd. \u201cDowd has a good sense of it, he talked to them at the time,\u201d Giuliani replied, later adding, \u201cI think that through, through John Dowd, we have a pretty good sense of it.\u201d \u201cJohn Dowd yesterday said \u2013 I\u2019ll use his words rather than mine \u2013 that McGahn was a strong witness for the President, so I don\u2019t need to know much more about that,\u201d Giuliani said. People familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking told the Times that his realization that he was unaware of what McGahn shared with Mueller\u2019s team shook the President, who is said to be obsessed with the informant role that John W. Dean, then the White House counsel to President Richard Nixon and now a CNN contributor, played during Watergate. On Sunday morning, Trump referenced Dean in a Twitter post lashing out at the Times\u2019 report a day earlier, calling it \u201ca Fake piece\u201d that implied \u201cbecause White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type \u2018RAT. But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d Dean fired back, \u201c@realDonaldTrump (I still have trouble using the title Mr. President for someone installed by Putin), I doubt you have ANY IDEA what McGahn has told Mueller. Also, Nixon knew I was meeting with prosecutors, b/c I told him. However, he didn\u2019t think I would tell them the truth!\u201d Politico reported Sunday that Dean has met several times over the past few months with Lanny Davis, the attorney representing former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, who is under criminal investigation in New York because of his business dealings. \u201cI reached out to my old friend John Dean because of what he went through with Watergate, and I saw some parallels to what Michael Cohen is experiencing,\u201d Davis told Politico. \u201cI wanted to gain from John\u2019s wisdom.\u201d Davis added that he had asked Dean for a retelling of his experiences during the Nixon investigation, not for legal counsel on Cohen\u2019s case.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani said Sunday that the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between senior Trump campaign officials and Russians \u201cwas originally for the purpose of getting information about (Hillary) Clinton,\u201d but denied any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. The description of the meeting, which was held between the President\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, among others, starkly contrasts initial explanations that the meeting was about a Russian adoption policy. \u201cWell, because the meeting was originally for the purpose of getting information about, about Clinton,\u201d Giuliani said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d later adding, \u201cThat was the original intention of the meeting. It turned out to be a meeting about another subject and it was not pursued at all. And, of course, any meeting with regards to getting information on your opponent is something any candidate\u2019s staff would take. If someone said, \u2018I have information about your opponent,\u2019 you would take that meeting.\u201d The Trump Tower meeting: A timeline In the interview, Giuliani sought to excuse the meeting because of the outcome, as the President has looked to do, although critics have alleged that the intention of the meeting \u2013 to get dirt on Clinton from the Russian government in an effort to harm her candidacy for president \u2013 could provide evidence of collusion with Russia to affect the 2016 election outcome. Giuliani\u2019s words mirror the President\u2019s insistence that the Trump Tower meeting was held \u201cto get information on an opponent\u201d and was \u201ctotally legal,\u201d but ultimately \u201cwent nowhere.\u201d Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it! Giuliani suggested the Trump campaign officials in attendance at the Trump Tower meeting might not have known that the meeting was with Russians or that the lawyer in attendance, Veselnitskaya, was a Russian with ties to the Kremlin. \u201cI don\u2019t even know if they knew (Veselnitskaya) was Russian at the time. All they had was her name. \u2026 They knew it when they met with her, not when they set up the meeting,\u201d Giuliani said. \u201cAll they knew was that a woman with a Russian name wanted to meet with them. They didn\u2019t know she was a representative of the Russian government, and indeed she\u2019s not a representative of the Russian government.\u201d However, in an email to Trump Jr., British music publicist Rob Goldstone, attempting to facilitate the meeting, wrote that \u201cthe Crown prosecutor of Russia met with Aras\u201d Agalarov, a Moscow-based billionaire developer who partnered with Trump to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow in 2013, \u201cthis morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.\u201d \u201cThis is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government\u2019s support for Mr. Trump \u2013 helped along by Aras and Emin,\u201d Goldstone continued, mentioning Aras\u2019 son, Russian pop star Emin Agalarov, who he said had relayed the information. 20 times Trump and his allies denied he knew of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting Trump Jr. acknowledged the email, writing back in part, \u201cIf it\u2019s what you say I love it.\u201d In subsequent emails to schedule the meeting, Trump Jr. emailed Manafort and Kushner, among others, with the subject line, \u201cRussia - Clinton - private and confidential.\u201d Kushner has denied improper actions, including collusion, during the course of the 2016 presidential campaign. In July 2017 following his meeting with Senate Intelligence Committee staff, he said \u201cI did not collude with Russia,\u201d adding, \u201cI do not know of anyone else\u201d on the campaign who did so. On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Giuliani also discussed White House counsel Don McGahn\u2019s extensive cooperation with special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice. Giuliani indicated to the show\u2019s anchor, Chuck Todd, that he did not personally know what McGahn told Mueller\u2019s team, but rather, that the team had a \u201cpretty good sense\u201d of what McGahn said through former Trump lawyer John Dowd. NYT: White House counsel McGahn cooperated 'extensively' with special counsel probe \u201cWe have a good sense, obviously, of what Mr. McGahn testified to, I can figure it out from \u2026\u201d Giulani said. \u201cWait,\u201d Todd interjected. \u201cHow do you say that, \u2018good sense\u2019? Have you debriefed him?\u201d \u201cNo, no, but Mr. Dowd has a good sense of it, he talked to them at the time,\u201d Giuliani replied, later adding, \u201cI think that through, through John Dowd, we have a pretty good sense of it.\u201d \u201cJohn Dowd yesterday said \u2013 I\u2019ll use his words rather than mine \u2013 that McGahn was a strong witness for the President, so I don\u2019t need to know much more about that,\u201d Giuliani said. The New York Times reported Saturday that McGahn has cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, participating in several interviews spanning 30 hours over the last nine months. The Times reported that McGahn\u2019s decision to cooperate was partly due to the fact that the President\u2019s initial legal team had decided to fully cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, believing their client had nothing to hide and they could bring a quick end to the probe. But McGahn became concerned that the President planned to set him up to be held responsible for any potential illegal incidents of obstruction, the Times reported, citing to people close to him. So the White House counsel and his attorney came up with a strategy to cooperate as extensively as possible with the special counsel in order to prove that there was no wrongdoing by McGahn, the newspaper reported. Trump blasted the Times\u2019 story in several tweets Sunday, saying he allowed McGahn and \u201call others to testify - I didn\u2019t have to. I have nothing to hide. \u2026\u201d The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type \u201cRAT.\u201d But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn\u2019t have to. I have nothing to hide...... ....and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close. So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST! Yet Mueller & his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse! The Times said in a response on Twitter that it stood by the reporting. The New York Times stands behind the reporting of our Pulitzer-Prize winning reporters @nytmike and @maggieNYT.Read the article that President Trump has been tweeting about this morning: https://t.co/flzSzluITY McGahn\u2019s personal attorney, William Burck, said in a statement Saturday, \u201cPresident Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn\u2019s testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team\u2019s questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must.\u201d CNN\u2019s Adam Levine, Clare Foran and Ariane de Vogue contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "White House counsel Don McGahn has cooperated extensively with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe, participating in several interviews spanning 30 hours over the last nine months, The New York Times reported Saturday. McGahn has provided \u201cdetailed accounts about the episodes at the heart of the inquiry into whether President Trump obstructed justice,\u201d including providing information that the Mueller team otherwise would not have learned about, the Times reported, citing a dozen current and former White House officials and other individuals briefed on the matter. A source familiar with McGahn\u2019s thinking told CNN on Saturday that McGahn and Mueller\u2019s team had \u201cseveral, several\u201d hours discussions on at least three occasions. CNN previously reported there had been three interviews between McGahn and Mueller\u2019s team. The Times reported that McGahn\u2019s decision to cooperate was partly due to the fact that the President\u2019s initial legal team had decided to fully cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, believing their client had nothing to hide and they could bring a quick end to the probe. The source familiar with McGahn\u2019s thinking told CNN that the strategy of the President\u2019s legal team surprised those close to McGahn, who thought Trump\u2019s lawyers would have placed limits on an interview, or, if they refused to allow the interview outright, would have entered into a subpoena fight. There was a feeling that the President\u2019s legal team \u201copened the cupboard door\u201d to everything, the source said. McGahn became concerned that the President planned to set him up to be held responsible for any potential illegal incidents of obstruction, the Times reported, citing to people close to him. So the White House counsel and his attorney came up with a strategy to cooperate as extensively as possible with the special counsel in order to prove that there was no wrongdoing by McGahn, the newspaper reported. Another source close to McGahn disputed any implication that he was doing anything but following the requests of Trump\u2019s legal team. Once the President\u2019s legal team made the decision to waive executive and attorney-client privilege, McGahn had no choice except to cooperate, the source said. Trump wrote on Twitter Saturday evening that he \u201callowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion, No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!\u201d McGahn\u2019s personal attorney, William Burck, said in a statement Saturday, \u201cPresident Trump, through counsel, declined to assert any privilege over Mr. McGahn\u2019s testimony, so Mr. McGahn answered the Special Counsel team\u2019s questions fulsomely and honestly, as any person interviewed by federal investigators must.\u201d I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion, No Obstruction. Witch Hunt! Trump\u2019s attorney Rudy Giuliani says McGahn \u201cwas sanctioned\u201d to do the interviews with Mueller\u2019s team. \u201cMcGahn was sanctioned to do it,\u201d Giuliani told CNN. \u201cHe was encouraged to do it\u201d by John Dowd, who was then Trump\u2019s lead private attorney. \u201cDowd was comfortable with it. The strategy at the time was complete cooperation,\u201d Giuliani said. He added about the Times report, \u201cWe think it was leaked to get the President to testify \u2013 that he would get angry at (McGahn) the way he did at Omarosa \u2013 and would want to testify.\u201d The Times reported that McGahn has told investigators that he has not witnessed the President take any action that exceeds \u201chis legal authorities.\u201d The newspaper also reported that, according to a person with knowledge of the President\u2019s thinking, Trump incorrectly thought that McGahn would act as a personal attorney would and solely defend the President\u2019s interests in interactions with the special counsel team. But McGahn laid out how Trump \u201ctried to ensure control of the investigation, giving investigators a mix of information both potentially damaging and favorable to the president,\u201d the Times\u2019 report said. In remarks to CNN, a person with direct knowledge of McGahn\u2019s legal strategy did not \u201cagree with the insinuation in the article that Don provided incriminating information about Trump. He just told the truth as he was required to.\u201d In response to a request for comment on the Times\u2019 report from CNN, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said, \u201cThe president and Don have a great relationship\u201d and Trump \u201cappreciates all the hard work he\u2019s done, particularly his help and expertise with judges.\u201d Shortly after the Times published its report on Saturday, Giuliani called on Mueller\u2019s team to wrap up its investigation and file a report on its findings. \u201cTime for Mueller investigation to file report,\u201d Giuliani wrote on Twitter. \u201cWe will release ours. Don\u2019t interfere with election like Comey. The President had nothing to do with Russians. He didn\u2019t obstruct an investigation. 1.4 million documents and 32 witnesses no privilege raised.\u201d Asked his view about the level of McGahn\u2019s cooperation with Mueller\u2019s team, CNN legal analyst Ross Garber told CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield on Saturday, \u201cIt really is extraordinary.\u201d \u201cTo give up those privileges so early, I was frankly surprised, and it appears it may come back to hurt the President and perhaps the presidency,\u201d Garber added. Garber said later, \u201cLet\u2019s be clear: he (McGahn) is a witness. He went in and sat with prosecutors and the agents, and he provided information. The White House counsel is a witness. And probably a very important one.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles, Veronica Stracqualursi, Betsy Klein and Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s move to revoke former CIA Director John Brennan\u2019s security clearance is unprecedented. And as Trump considers revoking the security clearances of more of his critics, security analysts say it could carry dire consequences \u2013 even if they agree he holds the power to do it. Top officials sometimes maintain their access so that they can provide requested counsel to their successors on classified matters, analysts said. This denial of access will eliminate that as a possibility, national security experts said. Aside from causing a political backlash, revoking security clearances of former officials who have criticized him also undermines the entire security system \u2013 from a privilege based on status and character \u2013 to a weaponized political tool, security analysts said. \u201cIt is absolutely unprecedented,\u201d said former FBI Special Agent Frank Montoya, who has extensive experience in counterintelligence matters. \u201cIn the end, the President is the final authority (on security clearances), but it\u2019s an abuse of power.\u201d Trump revokes ex-CIA director John Brennan's security clearance The normal process is for the issuing agency to conduct appropriate reviews and make determinations about clearance status. But White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that Trump revoked Brennan\u2019s security clearance in large part because of his \u201cerratic conduct and behavior.\u201d The President later told The Wall Street Journal he did so because of Brennan\u2019s role in sparking the investigation into Russian election interference and allegations of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. To revoke security clearances, Trump could follow the decades-old executive order in place, which provides a written explanation to the clearance holder and an opportunity to reply. Officials could also try to invoke the \u201cinterests of national security\u201d clause, which is found in that section, and avoid the detailed procedures. Finally, Trump could decide he is revoking eligibility for the former intelligence officials unilaterally. The latter appears to be how Trump proceeded, declaring in a statement that he \u201cexercised my constitutional authority to deny Mr. Brennan access to classified information.\u201d Experts emphasize there is no legal precedent for the President to revoke clearances on his own, as typically revocations would be done by the agency and not for political purposes. Rand Paul asks Trump to revoke Brennan security clearance The White House has signaled Brennan will not be the last official to see his security clearance revoked. Trump said in a statement Wednesday he is still considering revoking the security clearances of several others: former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former FBI Director James Comey, former CIA director and National Security Agency chief Michael Hayden, former deputy attorney general Sally Yates, former national security adviser Susan Rice, former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, former FBI officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, and Bruce Ohr, a current Justice Department official. The names amount to an unofficial enemies list for this White House. All of those individuals have been the target of Trump\u2019s public ire or criticized Trump \u2013 or both. Despite that, Sanders insisted on Wednesday that Trump\u2019s decision to revoke Brennan\u2019s clearance and put other critics on notice is not politically motivated. \u201cThe President has a constitutional responsibility to protect classified information and who has access to it, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s doing is fulfilling that responsibility in this action,\u201d Sanders said. National security lawyer Bradley Moss, who routinely represents clients in security clearance disputes, said it\u2019s important to distinguish between \u201caccess\u201d and \u201celigibility\u201d to receive classified information. For former FBI officials such as Comey and McCabe \u2013 who were fired \u2013 their access to classified information was terminated when they left government service. \u201cIt\u2019s not really a revocation where it\u2019s already gone,\u201d Montoya explained. But former top national security officials, such as Clapper and Brennan, have decades of institutional knowledge and security clearances provide them the ability to consult on specific matters with current officials and provide insight if asked. \u201cIt\u2019s a red herring to say they\u2019re monetizing it \u2013 what senior official doesn\u2019t try to write a book?\u201d Montoya added. There are 13 guidelines for clearances, which were established many years ago, says attorney Mark Zaid who adds, they were tweaked during the Bush and Obama administrations to the further benefit of the clearance holders. According to Zaid, who regularly represents security clearance applicants, not one of the 13 guidelines pertains to political views. The closest one says that anybody who supports the \u201cviolent overthrow\u201d of the US government should not have access to US intelligence. Holding an opposing view to any administration does not have any relevance, Zaid said. Steven Aftergood, director of the Federation of American Scientists project on government secrecy, said the move would turn intelligence from a security procedure to a political tool \u2013 one Trump can\u2019t exercise without some sort of cause. \u201cHe can\u2019t just say, \u2018I don\u2019t like those guys,\u2019 or \u2018They were mean to me,\u2019 \u201d Aftergood said. \u201cHe would need to specify a particular offense that they committed that would justify revoking their clearance. Saying mean things about the President wouldn\u2019t qualify.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Elise Labott contributed to this report. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is giving Americans a glimpse of the fury raging inside him as a pivotal moment nears for special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, and different strands of political and legal vulnerability swirling around the President become ever more threatening. Trump launched his most personal attack to date against Mueller in a tweetstorm Sunday unleashed just two days before the special counsel\u2019s office takes its first prosecution \u2013 that of the President\u2019s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u2013 to trial in Virginia. \u201cThere is no Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday. Trump\u2019s tweets on Sunday represented his most specific attempt yet to discredit any findings of the Mueller investigation into alleged election collusion with Russians, following clear signs that his previous assaults have been effective in hardening the opinion of GOP voters against the probe. The attacks are not simply a window into his own rage, they also represent a coherent hardball strategy to unite his ever loyal political base and other Republicans behind him. With 100 days to go until midterm elections, that could be tough for the GOP. There are 100 days to the midterm election. Here's what to watch But they also have the effect of wresting attention from the President\u2019s best hope of averting a Democratic rout in the election, the building narrative that he has unleashed a period of national prosperity, highlighted by economic growth rate of 4.1% in the second quarter of the year. The President\u2019s Sunday outburst came days after CNN reported that Michael Cohen, the President\u2019s former lawyer, is willing to tell Mueller that Trump knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump tower in which Russians were willing to hand over dirt on Hillary Clinton. The President has denied he knew about the meeting beforehand. RELATED: 20 times Trump and his allies denied he knew of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting Also last week, it emerged that Allen Weisselberg, the longtime chief financial officer of the Trump Organization, has been subpoenaed in the federal criminal investigation into Cohen in a move that adds to a sense that a net is closing around the President\u2019s inner circle. And ironically, given the President\u2019s chosen method of attack Sunday, The New York Times reported last week that Mueller was examining Trump\u2019s tweets to see whether they show malicious intent to obstruct justice in the firing of former FBI Director James Comey. \u201cIs Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship, I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) & Comey is his close friend,\u201d Trump said in a second tweet. The President followed up with a third blast against Mueller. \u201c\u2026Also, why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems, some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary, others, including himself, have worked for Obama\u2026.And why isn\u2019t Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta, Dossier?\u201d Trump\u2019s trio of tweets were packed with inaccuracies and misrepresentations, but closely mirrored the conspiracy theories driven by his allies in conservative media that are designed to rough up Mueller and tarnish the credibility of his investigation to politicize any eventual allegations of wrongdoing he makes against Trump or members of his team. It was not immediately clear what the President meant when he claimed there were conflicts of interests involving Mueller. The New York Times reported in January that the President claimed a dispute over membership fees had prompted Mueller to leave a Trump golf club in Washington in 2011 when he was FBI Director. A joint news conference with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte at the White House could provide reporters with an opportunity to question Trump about the accusation Monday afternoon. Ethics experts from the Justice Department determined last year when Mueller was appointed special counsel that his participation in the matters assigned to him is appropriate. Trump\u2019s attacks on Mueller followed yet another extraordinary assault on the media by the President after he broke details of a private meeting he had with A.G. Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times on July 20. \u201cWhen the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk! Very unpatriotic!\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon. Scaramucci: Decision to bar CNN reporter 'probably came from' Trump Taken together with the Mueller offensive, the tweet represented an escalation of Trump\u2019s strategy to discredit the integrity and moral standing of any institution that will ultimately help to shape a national consensus on his conduct. There has been no publicly available evidence that Trump or his subordinates knowingly conspired with a Russian effort to help him win power in 2016. But Trump\u2019s constant attacks on Mueller will inevitably renew speculation about Mueller\u2019s position and whether the President will attempt to fire him. Such a move could trigger a crisis of governance in Washington and test whether Republicans, who have largely been unwilling to challenge Trump in the Russia election interference drama and will hold the President to account. Trump\u2019s allies also sought to shred the credibility of Cohen, after the President\u2019s former confidant turned against him, and following the airing last week of a tape obtained by CNN on which the two men discussed how they would buy the rights to a Playboy model\u2019s story about an alleged affair Trump had with her years before he turned to politics. In an interview on Fox News Saturday evening, the President\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said Trump\u2019s legal team was investigating the tape of Trump and Cohen and suggested it might have been doctored. On Sunday, on CBS \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Giuliani said, \u201cI don\u2019t see how you can believe Michael Cohen,\u201d and accused Cohen of violating Trump\u2019s attorney-client privilege. Cohen\u2019s attorney Lanny Davis issued a statement calling Giuliani \u201cconfused.\u201d Giuliani once praised Michael Cohen as 'honest,' but now says Cohen has 'lied all his life' \u201cMr. Giuliani seems to be confused. He expressly waived attorney client privilege last week and repeatedly and inaccurately \u2013 as proven by the tape \u2013 talked and talked about the recording, forfeiting all confidentiality,\u201d Davis said. The cresting intrigue about Mueller, Cohen and the President\u2019s increasingly tetchy mood robbed the White House of a clean victory lap, following the positive economic data released Friday. The 4.1% GDP growth rate figure will form the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s midterm election argument to voters that he has unleashed a new age of American prosperity that Republicans hope will prove more important to their choice than the ominous developments in the Russia probe and the uproar perpetually whipped up by the President\u2019s convention-shattering style. \u201cPolicies matter a lot \u2026 and I think the President deserves a victory lap,\u201d the President\u2019s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump on Friday denied his former personal attorney Michael Cohen\u2019s claim that he knew in advance about a highly controversial 2016 Trump Tower meeting, the latest public breach in the fraying relationship between the President and his former confidant. \u201c(No,) I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr.\u201d Trump wrote as part of a series of tweets Friday morning. \u201cSounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?).\u201d .....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary\u2019s lawyer. Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice! Sources told CNN that Cohen claims that then-candidate Trump had advance notice of the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. and is willing to assert that claim to special counsel Robert Mueller. The meeting was premised on the expectation that Russians would offer campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton, and it\u2019s become a key focus of Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election and whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Moscow. US intelligence agencies say Russia interfered to support Trump\u2019s candidacy. According to sources, Cohen alleges that he was present, along with several others, when Trump was informed by his son about the Russians\u2019 offer and Trump gave his approval to go ahead with the meeting. The sources said Cohen does not have evidence, such as audio recordings, to corroborate his claim, but he is willing to attest to his account. The meeting at Trump Tower \u2013 which was attended by Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort \u2013 was first publicly revealed in news reports in July 2017, and Trump, his lawyers and allies have since offered misleading explanations and changing narratives about it. Cohen is under criminal investigation in the Southern District of New York because of his business dealings and efforts during the 2016 campaign to suppress negative stories about Trump. An FBI raid on Cohen\u2019s office in April sought information about taxi owners who had financial dealings with Cohen, CNN has reported. Cohen has hired Lanny Davis, a former special counsel to President Bill Clinton, to represent him. \u201c(Cohen) even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary\u2019s (Clinton) lawyer,\u201d Trump also wrote, referring to Davis. \u201cGee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice!\u201d Trump did not respond to shouted questions about Cohen from reporters after speaking about the economy at the White House Friday morning. In an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d Thursday night, Trump\u2019s lawyer in the Russia investigation, Rudy Giuliani, called Cohen a \u201cpathological liar.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see how he\u2019s got any credibility,\u201d the former New York City mayor said. Trump also lashed out at Mueller in reaction to the news that Mueller has been reviewing Trump\u2019s Twitter feed as part of the investigation into obstruction of justice. \u201cArrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major U.S. Steel plant in Granite City, Illinois, only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of 13 Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion\u2026\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201c(The) only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats, so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged Witch Hunt continues!\u201d The New York Times, citing three people briefed on the matter, reported Thursday that Mueller was looking at Trump\u2019s negative postings on Attorney General Jeff Sessions and fired FBI Director James Comey. There is no public evidence backing Trump\u2019s claim that Democrats colluded with the Russian government. The President has repeatedly attacked Mueller\u2019s investigation as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and denied all allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians. Trump\u2019s attack on Cohen Friday morning is the latest breakdown in the once close relationship between the two men. Cohen served as a top Trump confidant for more than a decade but has recently signaled a willingness to cooperate with investigators amid his legal troubles and what he sees as abandonment by the President. According to his friends, Cohen has been agonizing over hearing nothing from the President as he\u2019s being investigated and has been sending up flares this past month, signaling that his loyalty would be to his \u201cfamily and country,\u201d not to Trump. Earlier this week, CNN aired a secret recording Cohen made of a conversation he had with Trump in 2016 regarding the rights to a Playboy model\u2019s story about an alleged affair with Trump. Trump\u2019s legal team has waived attorney-client privilege on the recording, giving prosecutors the option to use it in their investigation into Cohen. The President has denied the allegations of the affair. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Jim Sciutto, Allie Malloy and Carl Bernstein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is lashing out in all directions as the fallout from his summit with Vladimir Putin becomes ever more toxic, the Russia investigation grinds on with no end in sight, and his frustration boils over on a lack of progress on North Korea. The tensions reached a new level Sunday night when the President issued an all-caps threat against Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who had warned the US that war with Tehran would be the \u201cmother of all wars.\u201d Trump tweeted that Iran would \u201csuffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before\u201d if its government again threatened the US, immediately ratcheting up tensions. Exacerbating a sense of a White House under siege is the President\u2019s full-out assault on his former lawyer Michael Cohen, who recorded a conversation with Trump about a payment to a former Playboy model who alleges she had an affair with the former real estate tycoon before he entered politics. The controversies raging around the Oval Office underline how the President is increasingly taking control of his own defense and is willing to dictate high-risk political and legal strategies. But his incessant and often false attacks on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation also give the impression of someone who fears its ultimate conclusions and is unsettled that his fate may be out of his hands. The most surreal aspect of the latest lurches of this unparalleled presidency is the intensifying public debate over the once implausible idea that the President of the United States is compromised by a hostile foreign power. But Trump is vehemently defending the summit in Helsinki, Finland, seven days ago as a great success, despite lingering mystery over what went on in his private one-on-one meeting with Putin and amid uproar over his invitation to the Russian leader for a second summit at the White House. He is also facing increasing scrutiny about the results of another major summit: his encounter with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore last month, which ended with Trump declaring he had solved the isolated nation\u2019s nuclear threat. Since then, Pyongyang has returned to its characteristic strategy of diplomatic obfuscation and delay. The Washington Post reported Sunday that despite publicly talking up the success of the summit, Trump was fuming to aides in private that there had not been more dramatic steps forward in denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak reported Sunday that according to a US official, the President had indeed registered frustration, but he was also convinced that North Korea\u2019s continued suspension of nuclear and missile tests was a positive achievement. One week on from the Putin summit, no one can stop talking about it. And Trump\u2019s defiance and failure to publicly rebuke the Russian leader in Finland over election interference is spurring unusual criticism from Republicans. \u201cThe evidence is overwhelming,\u201d South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIt can be proven beyond any evidentiary burden that Russia is not our friend and they tried to attack us in 2016,\u201d Gowdy said. \u201cSo the President either needs to rely on the people that he has chosen to advise him, or those advisers need to reevaluate whether or not they can serve in this administration. But the disconnect cannot continue. The evidence is overwhelming, and the President needs to say that and act like it.\u201d Still, on Sunday, Trump appeared to return to a previous position that Russia\u2019s election interference was a story dreamed up by Democrats to excuse Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat \u2013 despite saying in a scripted statement last week that he held Putin personally responsible for it. \u201cSo President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn\u2019t he do something about it? Why didn\u2019t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, that\u2019s why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!\u201d Trump tweeted. The intensifying saga of presidential misdirection, recriminations and accusations is a sure sign that the corrosive impact on American politics triggered by the Russian election intrigue is worsening. The odds of it ending in any manner that does not deepen political divides are lengthening by the day. The question of why the President is acting in a way that often seems to further Russian goals \u2013 for example in his attacks on allied leaders and institutions like NATO \u2013 is driving growing concerns about his attitude toward Russia and explains why the controversy over the Helsinki summit is showing no signs of ebbing. \u201cI think there\u2019s no ignoring the fact that for whatever reason, this President acts like he\u2019s compromised,\u201d Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said on ABC News\u2019 \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThere is simply no other way to explain why he would side with this Kremlin former KGB officer rather than his own intelligence agencies,\u201d he said. But Tom Bossert, the former White House homeland security adviser, said on the same show that suggestions that Trump was compromised by Russia were a \u201ccheap shot.\u201d Contrasting Putin\u2019s background as a former KGB agent who uses \u201cpenny-ante spy tactics\u201d with Trump\u2019s as a former businessman, Bossert said, \u201cWe spend our time trying to have productive meetings with foreign leaders. All the rest of this speculation and smoke is meant to undermine the President. It\u2019s domestic partisan political concern mixed with some legitimate need to throw our intelligence forces against the prevention of spying and interfering in the United States.\u201d Whatever Trump\u2019s motivation, there is also anxiety in Washington over his strategy of getting closer to Putin, even though most observers understand the necessity of communication between the world\u2019s two top nuclear powers at a time of dangerously ruptured ties with Moscow. \u201c(Putin) is not interested in better relations with the United States,\u201d Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d implicitly contradicting Trump\u2019s rationale for engaging the Russian leader. \u201cI think he walked away from that a long time ago. He\u2019s interested in gaining advantage at our expense and to his benefit.  And as long as we go in with a very clear understanding, we can engage him all we want, but not under any illusion.\u201d Mystification over Trump\u2019s invitation to the Russian leader is compounded by the astounding prospect that the meeting with Putin will be in Washington in the fall, around the time of midterm elections, which US intelligence agencies say are already being targeted by Russia. There is also uncertainty about the long-term fate of Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats after his dumbfounded on-camera reaction at a security forum in Aspen, Colorado, on Thursday to the breaking news about the invitation to Putin. Coats issued a remarkable statement on Saturday that is being interpreted as a bid to keep his job. \u201cMy admittedly awkward response was in no way meant to be disrespectful or criticize the actions of the President,\u201d Coats said. While he remains consumed by his outreach to Putin, Trump is also fuming about Mueller\u2019s investigation, apparently reasoning that he can use it to drum up partisan fury that will enthuse the base voters he needs to stave off a Democratic surge in the midterms. \u201cNo Collusion, No Obstruction - but that doesn\u2019t matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election,\u201d Trump tweeted on Saturday night. \u201cRepublicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!\u201d The President also accused the Justice Department and the FBI of misleading the courts, following the release of a previously classified warrant application to surveil former Trump  campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Trump tweeted that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act documents \u201cconfirm with little doubt\u201d that the Justice Department and FBI \u201cmisled the courts,\u201d despite the fact that the document itself acted as legal justification for the FBI to obtain the 2016 warrant. But Trump\u2019s attacks on the special counsel pose their own questions. To begin with, his prolonged assault on the investigation hardly suggests he has nothing to hide from Mueller. They also worsen the partisan imbroglio that plays directly into Putin\u2019s desire to weaken American democracy. While Trump\u2019s ultra-sensitivity about Mueller looks suspicious, it could also be born out of an explosive reaction every time there is any question about the legitimacy of his election victory and his trademark insistence on hitting back harder anytime he feels he is unfairly attacked. As if the Russia-related histrionics were not dramatic enough, there is also new intrigue about the case of Trump\u2019s former lawyer Cohen, who is under federal investigation amid increasing concern among the President\u2019s supporters that the attorney could turn on his former top client. CNN reported on Friday that Trump\u2019s lawyers waived attorney-client privilege on the President\u2019s behalf regarding a secretly recorded conversation he had in September 2016 with Cohen in which they discussed a payment to ex-Playboy model Karen McDougal. Lanny Davis, an attorney for Cohen, questioned whether the tape, first reported by The New York Times, supported the arguments of the President\u2019s lawyers that there was no wrongdoing by the President. But in a possible sign of concern that Cohen could chose to cooperate with prosecutors in a way that could deepen the President\u2019s legal exposure, Trump lambasted Cohen in a tweet Saturday that mischaracterized the FBI\u2019s raid on his home and office in April, which was executed on a court-approved warrant, amid a criminal investigation of Cohen by the US attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York. Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer\u2019s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong! \u201cInconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer\u2019s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cEven more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal.

            "article_content": "US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh said back in 1999 that the landmark Supreme Court opinion that ordered President Richard Nixon to turn over White House recordings toward the end of the Watergate investigation might have been \u201cwrongly decided.\u201d The comments were part of an interview in a publication called Washington Lawyer and were included in the thousands of pages of documents released to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Saturday. Reached for comment, the White House pointed to a more recent speech in which Kavanaugh praised the 1974 opinion in United States v. Nixon, which set a key precedent limiting presidential claims of executive privilege. It was unclear if Kavanaugh had had a change of heart over the years. The White House official declined to offer more context. The inconsistency between what President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee said in 1999 and later on will raise questions during his confirmation hearing, and the release comes as some Democrats have expressed concern over Kavanaugh\u2019s views on presidential power given that he has suggested in the past that presidents be shielded from civil and criminal litigation until they leave office. His comments on the subject could  take on more importance as special counsel Robert Mueller seeks to interview Trump as part of his probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. During a roundtable discussion with other lawyers published in the magazine, Kavanaugh said, \u201cBut maybe Nixon was wrongly decided \u2014 heresy though it is to say so.\u201d Kavanaugh said the case \u201ctook away the power of the president to control information in the executive branch by holding that the courts had power and jurisdiction to order the president to disclose information in response to a subpoena sought by a subordinate executive branch official.\u201d In the landmark ruling, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected Nixon\u2019s argument for an absolute privilege protecting him from any subpoena for documents related to internal communications. The roundtable discussion featured in the Washington Lawyer article, which was first reported by the Associated Press, explored the status of government attorney-client privilege in the aftermath of the Ken Starr investigation. Kavanaugh was part of that probe, which led to impeachment proceedings against former President Bill Clinton. Steve Vladeck, a CNN Supreme Court analyst and law professor at the University of Texas said of Kavanaugh\u2019s comments in the article, \u201cThis is not only another example of Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s dogmatic view of presidential power, it is a remarkably narrow view of how much the president can be held to account. The view that the case was wrongly decided would suggest that there is no mechanism in Kavanaugh\u2019s view through which the executive branch can investigate the President.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement Sunday that Kavanaugh\u2019s remarks on the case \u201cbodes very poorly for any decision that Kavanagh might make to hold President Trump accountable.\u201d A White House official declined to explain the discrepancy between Kavanaugh\u2019s views in 1999 and a speech at Catholic University in 2015 in which he described US v. Nixon as among a handful of cases that contributed to \u201cgreatest moments in American judicial history.\u201d In that speech, Kavanaugh said the cases represented occasions when judges \u201cstood up to the other branches, were not cowed and enforced the law.\u201d Thousands of pages of documents were attached to Kavanaugh\u2019s Senate questionnaire, which also described how he was selected to fill the seat of retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. He said he had discussions with Trump on three occasions before being chosen. White House Counsel Don McGahn first called him late in the afternoon of Wednesday June 27, the same day that Kennedy announced his retirement, Kavanaugh wrote in response to a question about the selection process. Several days later, on Monday July 2, Kavanaugh had his first interview with the President, the nominee writes. That was followed by an interview with Vice President Mike Pence on July 4. A second conversation with the President occurred by phone on the morning of Sunday, July 8. Later that evening, Kavanaugh traveled to the White House to meet with both the President and first lady Melania Trump. \u201cDuring that meeting, the President offered me the nomination, and I accepted,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. On July 9, the pick was made official during Trump\u2019s prime-time announcement. The Senate has not yet begun hearings to consider Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, and his answers in the newly released questionnaire will be closely scrutinized by lawmakers looking for insight into his past and how he was chosen by Trump to fill the high court vacancy. Top Republican senators, such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, have praised Kavanaugh, describing him as a highly qualified Supreme Court nominee. But Democrats have raised alarm over the nomination. Kennedy had voted to uphold a woman\u2019s right to abortion, and his departure has led to concern that Roe v. Wade, the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide could be at risk. Some Democrats have also expressed concern over Kavanaugh\u2019s views on presidential power given that he has suggested in the past that presidents be shielded from civil and criminal litigation until they leave office. Schumer focused on the issue in his statement on Sunday. \u201cIt is also very confounding that the common thread that has emerged thus far in the cases that Kavanaugh is willing to openly criticize is their relation to presidential power and accountability,\u201d said the Democratic senator from New York. \u201cBut because he has demonstrated a willingness to express his views on existing Supreme Court precedents, he must be able to answer direct questions on stare decisis on many other matters, including Roe and healthcare.\u201d One question in the Senate questionnaire asked if \u201canyone involved in the process of selecting you\u201d ever discussed \u201cany currently pending or specific case, legal issue, or question in a manner that could reasonably be interpreted as seeking any express or implied assurances concerning your position on such a case, issue or question?\u201d Kavanaugh gave only a one-word response: \u201cno.\u201d A version of the questionnaire is sent to every potential Supreme Court nominee, and Kavanaugh\u2019s version \u2014 110 page long \u2014 is similar to a form he filled out when he sought his current seat on a federal appeals court. Senate Democrats are pushing to review the lengthy paper trail associated with Kavanaugh, who previously served in former President George W. Bush\u2019s White House. CNN reported earlier this week that Democrats have deliberately held off on meeting with him until they can strike an agreement with Republicans on how to move forward on document procurement for the nomination. Grassley in a statement on Saturday called the questionnaire that Kavanaugh completed \u201cthe broadest and most comprehensive \u2026 ever sent by this committee.\u201d The questionnaire reveals Kavanaugh\u2019s employment history, club membership, press and speaking engagements and notable cases he has considered during his 12 years serving on the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. He lists his service as a clerk to Justice Kennedy, his tenure working for independent counsel Ken Starr during the investigation of former President Bill Clinton, and his time serving in the George W. Bush White House in the counsel\u2019s office and as staff secretary. Kavanaugh notes that he served as a member of a group called \u201cLawyers for Bush-Cheney\u201d during the controversial 2000 presidential election recount. \u201cI participated in legal activities on behalf of the \u201cBush/Cheney 2000 Campaign related to the 2000 election recount in DeLand, Florida,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote. Kavanaugh provides an extensive list of his published writings and public speaking engagements over the years. He includes his work on the Starr investigation report, scholarly writings and several articles he wrote as an undergraduate of Yale University covering the sports beat for the Yale Daily News. The record reveals that he spoke on several occasions at events sponsored by the conservative Federalist Society, a group that advises Trump on the Supreme Court. The speaking engagements span roughly the last 20 years. Kavanaugh included his membership at Catholic Charities as well as his coaching his daughter\u2019s basketball team at Blessed Sacrament School. He notes that he became a member of the Chevy Chase Club, a private country club located near Washington, DC, in 2016. He refers to the club as a \u201crecreational club\u201d and says, \u201cwe joined because the club has an outdoor hockey rink and a girls ice hockey program and because of its gym and sports facilities.\u201d He is a past member of the Congressional Country Club. A separate question points out that the American Bar Association\u2019s commentary to its Code of Judicial Conduct states that it is \u201cinappropriate for a judge to hold membership in any organization that invidiously discriminates on the basis of race sex, religion or national origin\u201d and asks if any organizations he is affiliated with currently or formerly did so. \u201cYears before I became a member of the Congressional Country Club and the Chevy Chase Club, it is my understanding that those clubs, like most similar clubs around the country, may have excluded members on discriminatory bases that should not have been acceptable to people then and would not be acceptable now,\u201d he wrote. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Adult film actress Stormy Daniels on Wednesday launched a new lawsuit against her former attorney, Keith Davidson, as well as President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, saying the two men \u201ccolluded\u201d and \u201cacted in concert\u201d to \u201cmanipulate\u201d Daniels and to benefit Trump. The lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court of California, is just the latest in Daniels\u2019 continuing onslaught against Cohen, led by her Los Angeles-based lawyer, Michael Avenatti \u2013 and all rooted in Daniels\u2019 alleged sexual encounter with Trump in 2006. The White House has said Trump denies the alleged affair. The lawsuit alleges that in January 2018, when Davidson was still representing Daniels, whose legal name is Stephanie Clifford, \u201cMr. Cohen immediately colluded with Mr. Davidson in an attempt to use and manipulate Ms. Clifford in a manner designed to benefit Mr. Cohen and Mr. Trump.\u201d The men sprung into action, the lawsuit alleges, when they became aware of the forthcoming publication of an In Touch magazine article that would detail Daniels\u2019 descriptions of her alleged affair with Trump. As part of the efforts to deny the affair, Cohen \u201chatched a plan to have Ms. Clifford appear on Mr. Sean Hannity\u2019s program to falsely deny the accuracy of the In Touch article,\u201d the lawsuit says. Included in Wednesday\u2019s lawsuit are alleged text messages exchanged between Cohen and Davidson that appear to show communications between January 2018 and March 2018. On January 17, text messages appear to show Cohen insistently trying to get Davidson on the phone to discuss Daniels going on Hannity\u2019s show on Fox News. According to the lawsuit, Cohen wanted Daniels to deny her alleged affair with Trump on television. \u201cI have her tentatively scheduled for Hannity tonight. Call me after your trial,\u201d Cohen wrote. Davidson responded that Daniels cannot do a TV appearance that night because of travel. \u201cI\u2019m trying to get her to commit for tomorrow,\u201d Davidson wrote. Cohen, who appears to grow increasingly frustrated, responded: \u201cIt\u2019s really important. Why?\u201d Later in the day, Cohen appears to have changed course. \u201cLet\u2019s forget tonight,\u201d he wrote. Some hours later, he added: \u201cThe wise men all believe the story is dying and don\u2019t think it\u2019s smart for her to do any interviews. Let her do her thing but no interviews at all with anyone.\u201d Davidson appears to agree, writing: \u201c100%.\u201d \u201cThanks pal,\u201d Cohen said. The lawsuit alleges that one of the \u201cwise men\u201d referenced by Cohen in the text is Trump himself and that the President therefore was aware of the efforts to get Daniels to deny the alleged affair on Hannity\u2019s show. Also included in the lawsuit are alleged text messages between Cohen and Davidson on March 2. The two men appear to communicate about arranging a phone call, and at one point, when Davidson asks Cohen whether he is calling him, Cohen responds: \u201cWith flotus. Give me a minute.\u201d The text is presumably a reference to first lady Melania Trump. CNN has previously reported that Cohen was in Mar-a-Lago that weekend in March, along with the President and the first lady. \u201cThese text messages show that the prior denials by Mr. Trump and Mr. Cohen relating to what Mr. Trump knew and about the honesty of my client were absolute lies,\u201d Avenatti said in a statement. \u201cThere was a significant cover-up here as part of an attempt to deceive the American people and Mrs. Trump and we intend on getting to the bottom of it.\u201d Avenatti also told CNN he is trying to get his hands on more text messages. But one person familiar with Cohen\u2019s thinking told CNN the text messages cited in the lawsuit represented discussions between two lawyers who wanted to ensure that the nondisclosure agreement Daniels signed was being adhered to. Cohen and Davidson simply did not want Daniels to be in violation of the agreement, which carries significant penalties, the person said. Davidson, the source added, was trying to protect his then-client. \u201cThis new lawsuit filed by Stephanie Clifford aka Stormy Daniels has no merit whatsoever as to my client, Michael Cohen. It appears to be yet another publicity stunt, and nothing more. We look forward to defeating the lawsuit in court,\u201d said Brent Blakely, Cohen\u2019s attorney. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 days before the 2016 election, as part of a hush agreement to prevent the porn star from publicly discussing her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. In recent weeks, Trump also acknowledged that he personally reimbursed Cohen for that payment. Dave Wedge, a spokesman for Davidson, also blasted the new lawsuit. \u201cThis outrageously frivolous lawsuit is yet another desperate attempt by Michael Avenatti to continue his \u2018publicity tour,\u2019 as well as divert attention from the recent allegations against him relating to bankruptcy proceedings and the failure to withhold millions of federal employee taxes,\u201d Wedge said. \u201cThat said, attorney Davidson is very happy that he has filed this lawsuit because he strongly believes that the filing constitutes a full and complete waiver of the attorney-client privilege. Thankfully, the truth can now finally come out to rebut the false narrative about attorney Davidson that Mr. Avenatti has been pushing in his more than 175 television appearances and countless other media interviews. Attorney Davidson believes that the American people deserve to know the entire truth \u2013 and they soon will.  This lawsuit has made that happen.\u201d Responding to the statement from Davidson\u2019s spokesman, Avenatti on Wednesday sent a formal letter to Davidson\u2019s attorneys, warning that Davidson is not waived from attorney-client privilege and cannot \u2013 and should not \u2013 make public any communications with Daniels that are protected. \u201cTo be clear, Mr. Davidson is instructed that he is not permitted to directly or indirectly disclose any attorney-client communications or other confidential documents/materials,\u201d Avenatti wrote. CNN\u2019s Gloria Bolger contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New York state authorities sweetened a plea offer made to a taxi operator who partnered with President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Michael Cohen after federal authorities raided Cohen\u2019s home, office and hotel room, according to court transcripts. Evgeny \u201cGene\u201d Freidman, known as New York\u2019s \u201cTaxi King,\u201d pleaded guilty last week to criminal tax fraud for failing to pay $5 million in taxes in a deal that would allow him to avoid prison time. The no-prison deal was a significant enhancement from an offer Freidman rejected on April 4 \u2013 just a few days before the FBI raid on Cohen \u2013 that would have included a minimum of two years and as much as six years in prison and a $1 million fine, according to transcripts of the March court proceeding. The offer included a sliding scale; if Freidman paid less than $1 million he would face more jail time.  Friedman had faced as much as 25 years in prison when he was charged last year. Russian oligarch met with Michael Cohen at Trump Tower during transition The investigation by US prosecutors in Manhattan was initiated in part by a referral from special counsel Robert Mueller. FBI agents working with Mueller have interviewed several business partners of Cohen as part of Mueller\u2019s broader inquiry into election meddling. Freidman\u2019s cooperation in the deal suggests he has useful information for prosecutors and could place added pressure on Cohen, who has been Trump\u2019s attorney for a decade, to cooperate with authorities. The initial offer and subsequent enhancement has not been previously reported. New York investigators made the initial offer in late March. When Freidman rejected the deal at the hearing two weeks later, John Healy, a lawyer with the state attorney general\u2019s office, told Justice Peter Lynch, \u201cThe offer is withdrawn. We don\u2019t intend to make any offers and we are ready for trial come June 18.\u201d But days later, on April 9, FBI agents working with the US attorney\u2019s office in Manhattan raided Cohen\u2019s home, office, hotel room and safe deposit box, seizing several boxes of documents and over a dozen electronic devices. Prosecutors have not said anything publicly about the raid being the impetus for a better deal. The search warrant authorized the seizure of information relating to any payments Cohen made to suppress women from coming forward with damaging information about the President and details about Cohen\u2019s taxi medallion business, sources have told CNN. Michael Cohen owes more than $280K in state taxes, records show As part of Freidman\u2019s plea deal he will cooperate with state and federal authorities, The New York Times first reported. A spokesman for the New York attorney general\u2019s office declined to comment. Freidman\u2019s attorney also declined to comment. Freidman owns and operates one of the largest taxi operations in the country. One of his clients is Cohen, who for more than two decades bought taxi medallions expanding a business started by his father-in-law. Cohen\u2019s taxi medallion holding companies owe New York more than $280,000 in unpaid taxes, an analysis of state records shows, with nearly two-thirds of the back taxes owed from April. Bloomberg, which first reported the unpaid taxes, said Cohen claims that he does not owe the taxes. Instead, the report said, Cohen claims Freidman is responsible for the payments. Cohen hasn\u2019t been charged with any wrongdoing, but his lawyers have been fighting in court to limit the government\u2019s review of the seized material. Judge Kimba Wood appointed a special master to review the material for records that may be protected by attorney-client privilege. At a hearing scheduled for Wednesday, the judge is expected to receive an update on the progress of the review. She may also decide whether to allow porn star Stormy Daniels\u2019 attorney Michael Avenatti to formally appear in the case. Daniels has sued Cohen to nullify a $130,000 \u201chush money\u201d deal to keep details about the porn star\u2019s alleged affair in 2006 with Trump quiet. Avenatti has said records that were seized may be relevant to his client. The White House has repeatedly said that the President denies the affair took place. NYT: Michael Cohen's 'taxi king' business partner to cooperate with government Cohen\u2019s attorneys have objected to Avenatti\u2019s appearance, saying he made inaccurate public statements about Cohen and improperly leaked personal financial records of Cohen that revealed millions of dollars of consulting contracts he had with a US investment firm linked to a Russian oligarch, AT&T and Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Avenatti has accused Cohen of leaking select audio recordings to the media that \u201cmay relate\u201d to Daniels and wants the judge to question Cohen\u2019s attorneys about any leaks. After Freidman\u2019s guilty plea and cooperation agreement became public, Cohen tweeted to distance himself from the taxi operator. \u201cI am one of thousands of medallion owners who entrust management companies to operate my medallions according to the rules of the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission. Gene Freidman and I are not partners and have never been partners in this business or any other,\u201d Cohen said. Freidman saw it differently. His attorney provided a statement to CNN last month on Freidman\u2019s behalf saying, \u201cWith regard to Michael Cohen, Michael is a great friend and a wonderful client.\u201d",

            "article_content": "\u201cNo chance in hell.\u201d \u201cWait your turn.\u201d \u201cWhy bother?\u201d Paulette Jordan has heard it all, especially in the waning hours before Tuesday\u2019s Idaho primary, where she is hoping to advance her long-shot candidacy for governor of Idaho. But as she can often do, given her height of nearly six feet, the Democrat and two-term Idaho state legislator lifts her gaze above the immediate ruckus. She instead looks through the long lens of her family\u2019s indigenous history that now drives her effort to become the first Native American governor in US history. \u201cI come from a powerful line of women. I\u2019m proud of that heritage and legacy,\u201d said Jordan, in response to a \u2018why bother?\u2019 question. \u201cThe opportunity for women is now. The President is divisive. Women know we can bring the country together. I\u2019m working to defend my state, my people, even as this President is part of spreading hate and fear.\u201d Jordan makes the criticism against Trump fully aware of his 2016 victory in her state, which he won by 32 points. Idaho is more than 80% white and voted Republican so long that the Idaho Statesman referred to all the Democratic candidates for governor starting in 1998 as the \u201csacrificial lamb in the governor\u2019s general election race.\u201d Still, the newspaper\u2019s editorial board gave her a lukewarm endorsement as \u201ca chance to excite Idahoans looking for new leadership.\u201d As both a Native American and a young woman, the 38-year-old believes she\u2019s the stark difference needed to crack that streak of losses racked up by those middle-aged, white male Democratic gubernatorial candidates. She\u2019s the antidote needed in the Trump era, she believes. With her youth and history-making run, her candidacy captures the most unmitigated example of a new kind of woman driven to run for higher office after Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss. There is an 'avalanche' of women running for office Indian Country Today counts a total of 23 Native American candidates running for statewide offices and Congress. Those candidacies can\u2019t solely be credited to a whiplash response to the 2016 election. Jordan sees it more as a growing engagement of Native Americans after the bitter history of colonization and marginalization. Jordan\u2019s personal history speaks to that engagement. She\u2019s a member of the Coeur d\u2019Alene tribe and traces her history back generations to the chiefs she says fought settler expansion. She was raised on a farm in rural northern Idaho and went on to the University of Washington, where she first engaged in local politics and grassroots activism. She returned home after graduation and became the youngest person elected to the Coeur d\u2019Alene Tribal Council. \u201cI\u2019m connected to the land,\u201d said Jordan, explaining her return to Idaho. \u201cI come from that legacy of a love affair with the air and wildlife. That legacy is unique and a deep part of this state.\u201d Jordan, seeking to expand the Native voice in state government, ran in 2014 for the Idaho House of Representatives and beat an incumbent Republican. Jordan proudly points out she was the only North Idaho progressive to win re-election in 2016. Since her candidacy began, Jordan has captured the imagination of national progressives and the media. Last January, she spoke at the Women\u2019s March in Las Vegas, where entertainment icon Cher tweeted her all-caps admiration. I Met & Talked With Paulette At LAS VEGAS WOMENS RALLY.I Believe The PPL Of IDAHO Would Be WELL SERVED With Paulette Jordan As Their Governor.She is a thoughtful, Caring,Intelligent,Woman,Who Would Work TIRELESSLY 2 BENEFIT\u201dALL THE PPL\u201dOf IDAHO\u2764\ufe0f \u201cShe\u2019s always invited to Idaho,\u201d laughed Jordan, recalling the meeting and the tweet. Support from Planned Parenthood, Indivisible and PAC Democracy for America followed. At the Idaho state level, support from her fellow legislators hasn\u2019t been as forthcoming. Many of her fellow Idaho House Democrats are endorsing her primary opponent, A.J. Balukoff. He ran for governor in 2014 and lost by double digits to the now-outgoing Republican governor, despite spending millions of his own money in his campaign. At age 72, Balukoff is a Boise School Board member who moved to Idaho later in life. When asked about Jordan, Balukoff told the Idaho Politics Weekly, \u201cI think people should stay with me this time around. She may be what we need the next time.\u201d Women seize on their past abuse to fuel political ambition Jordan doesn\u2019t take kindly to that comment. \u201cHe thinks because of his privilege he can buy into privilege. I\u2019ve rolled up my sleeves my entire life to earn my role. For someone to say, \u2018Step aside,\u2019 that\u2019s something women have heard before,\u201d said Jordan, her voice even but punctuated with seriousness. \u201cThis is our time.\u201d As if doubling down in response to the \u201cstep aside\u201d comment, Jordan chose another woman, Kristin Collum, as her running mate. Collum\u2019s campaign website describes a 12-year military career in the US Army, followed by engineering jobs in the tech sector. The two-woman ticket, in and of itself, is history-making in the state. Asked what happens on Tuesday if she loses in the Democratic primary, Jordan replied, \u201cWe\u2019ve already won. We\u2019ve inspired and excited our community.\u201d Then she added, \u201cI\u2019ll see you after Tuesday and we\u2019ll talk about the general.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has derided the Fifth Amendment as the refuge of mobsters, and during Watergate President Richard Nixon infamously told aides, \u201cI want you all to stonewall it, let them plead the Fifth Amendment, cover up, or anything else.\u201d Despite the negative implications of taking the Fifth, the US Supreme Court has long regarded the right against self-incrimination as a venerable part of the Constitution and tried to ensure that a witness\u2019 silence not be equated with guilt. In a possible switch in sentiment, Trump may end up taking the Fifth, his lawyer Rudy Giuliani suggested on Sunday. As he responded to questions about special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation, Giuliani declined to rule out Trump invoking his right against self-incrimination. Giuliani also said Trump wants to testify and that \u201cevery lawyer in America thinks he would be a fool to testify.\u201d Giuliani doesn't rule out that Trump could take Fifth Amendment in Mueller probe On a separate legal issue, Giuliani said Trump could resist a subpoena to testify \u2013 an assertion that conflicts with Supreme Court precedent. Mueller has reportedly raised the possibility of subpoenaing Trump as part of his investigation into any Trump campaign connection to Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election. The Supreme Court in 1974 rejected Nixon\u2019s claim of executive privilege to hold back Oval Office tape recordings related to the burglary of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate building. In 1997, the court ruled that President Bill Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to avoid a civil lawsuit by a woman claiming he had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas. If Trump wants to avoid an interview with Mueller\u2019s team, his most likely route may be the Fifth Amendment. As Trump\u2019s own remarks have made plain, any effort to elude Mueller, including by pleading the Fifth, could have political repercussions. \u201cIf you\u2019re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment,\u201d Trump said as a candidate in 2016, complaining about aides to his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who faced inquires over the use of a private email service when she was secretary of state. \u201cThe mob takes the Fifth,\u201d Trump declared. Giuliani: I'm 'focused on the law more than the facts right now' But in the judicial realm, the right is revered. Ratified in 1791, the Fifth Amendment protects a person from being \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d The amendment reflected an effort to protect witnesses from a kind of inquisitorial Star Chamber of 15th Century England. \u201cHistorically, the privilege was intended to prevent the use of legal compulsion to extract from the accused a sworn communication of facts which would incriminate him,\u201d the Supreme Court observed in a 2000 case. In a 2001 decision, the justices reiterated that the Fifth Amendment covers people irrespective of guilt or innocence, emphasizing that one of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \u201cbasic functions\u201d is to protect \u201cinnocent\u201d people \u201cwho otherwise might be ensnared by ambiguous circumstances.\u201d Criminal defense lawyers warn that witnesses may fall into a prosecutorial trap and produce incriminating answers. In a milestone 1965 ruling, the justices bolstered the principle that the Fifth Amendment prevents prosecutors and judges from using a person\u2019s silence against that person. \u201cThe Fifth Amendment,\u201d the court said, \u201cforbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d Through the years, the Supreme Court has affirmed that notion even as it has imposed new requirements on witnesses. In a 2013 case, the justices by a 5-4 vote allowed prosecutors to introduce in court evidence of a defendant\u2019s silence when interrogated about shotgun shells found at the scene of the crime, because he had not expressly invoked his right under the Fifth Amendment. Trump suggests legal action coming against Mueller's team Any presidential assertion of the Fifth Amendment spawns an array of political considerations. In 1998, independent counsel Kenneth Starr obtained a subpoena to compel Clinton\u2019s testimony regarding an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton did not assert the Fifth and agreed voluntarily to answer questions, which prompted Starr to withdraw the subpoena. Trump on Monday continued his efforts to discredit Mueller\u2019s investigation. He said he has not obstructed the \u201cthe Russia Witch Hunt.\u201d \u201cThere is no O, it\u2019s called Fighting Back,\u201d he tweeted. Last Friday, Trump emphasized that he wanted to talk to Mueller\u2019s team. \u201cI would love to speak,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cNobody wants to speak more than me. \u2026 I would love to speak because we\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d",

            "article_content": "If President Donald Trump tries to elude an interview with special counsel Robert Mueller by exerting a claim of executive privilege, then he could face an arduous battle in the courts. In the 1974 case of US v. Nixon, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected executive privilege in a ruling that triggered the culmination of the Watergate scandal. The high court concluded that \u201cthe fundamental demands of due process of law\u201d as well as the \u201cspecific need for evidence in a pending criminal trial\u201d overrode the President\u2019s assertion that he had a constitutional right to keep communications private. That case involved a subpoena for the President\u2019s Oval Office tapes, not for a personal interview. In separate possible blueprints for a president seeking to evade court-related proceedings, President Bill Clinton in the 1990s was subjected to a civil lawsuit and, separately, served with a subpoena to testify (the subpoena was withdrawn when Clinton agreed to testify voluntarily). Ty Cobb out as White House lawyer Mueller, who is investigating any Trump campaign connection to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, apparently is close to seeking an interview with Trump. Mueller has reportedly raised the possibility of subpoenaing Trump. Since taking control of the Russia probe last May, Mueller has charged several people, including 13 Russians for their use of social media during the campaign, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and is cooperating with the counsel\u2019s office; Manafort has pleaded not guilty to the various charges that include conspiracy and money laundering. Trump has repeatedly denounced the investigation and more recently derided reports about the possible questions Mueller might ask. He wrote Wednesday morning on Twitter, \u201cThere was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap).\u201d Trump\u2019s evolving legal team has sent conflicting signals about whether the President would accept or try to resist an interview with Mueller\u2019s team. Trump rips Justice Department in stinging set of tweets Although it is not a regular occurrence, presidents for centuries have sought to resist turning over materials to courts. In an 1807 case the Supreme Court cited when it ruled against Nixon and Clinton, President Thomas Jefferson tried to withhold personal documents from the treason trial of his former Vice President Aaron Burr. The modern touchstone for \u201cexecutive privilege,\u201d as the claim is now known, is US v. Nixon. The privilege arises from the separation of powers among the three branches and the principle that executive communications, such as military and diplomatic secrets, should remain confidential. That 1974 constitutional showdown began after a grand jury indicted seven aides and advisers to President Richard Nixon for conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and other offenses related to the break-in of the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate building in 1972. The grand jury named Nixon as an unindicted co-conspirator. The Watergate special prosecutor obtained a subpoena that directed Nixon to turn over tape recordings and documents relating to conversations with aides. Nixon refused, citing a broad claim of privilege to keep communications private, and the case quickly escalated to the Supreme Court, which heard the dispute on an expedited schedule in July 1974. The Mueller probe ain't ending anytime soon In the unanimous ruling written by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the court acknowledged the President\u2019s need to keep communications confidential but said it was eclipsed by the interests of the judicial process. \u201cWithout access to specific facts,\u201d Burger wrote, \u201ca criminal prosecution may be totally frustrated. The president\u2019s broad interest in confidentiality of communications will not be vitiated by disclosure of a limited number of conversations preliminarily shown to have some bearing on the pending criminal cases.\u201d The July 24 decision forced Nixon to relinquish the incriminating tapes, and he resigned from the presidency on August 9, 1974. The other major case concerning a President who tried to avoid being pulled into a judicial process is the 1997 case of Clinton v. Jones. In that dispute, the Supreme Court ruled Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to postpone a civil lawsuit by Paula Jones, who said he had sexually harassed her when he was governor of Arkansas. Trump suggests Mueller's obstruction questions are a 'setup & trap' As they argued for immunity, Clinton\u2019s lawyers said the President\u2019s involvement in the civil case would distract from executive branch business. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled for Jones, citing US v. Nixon and other cases. The court said that it did not expect Clinton\u2019s involvement in the case to be distracting and noted the overall principle that presidents can be subject to judicial proceedings when appropriate. The following year independent counsel Kenneth Starr obtained a subpoena to compel Clinton\u2019s testimony in a separate matter involving Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern with whom Clinton had had a relationship. When Clinton agreed to the interview, Starr withdrew the subpoena.",

            "article_content": "The marvel of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency is not that so many things happen that stretch the limits of credulity. It\u2019s that the scandals, presidential outbursts, shattered conventions, executive branch muscle-flexing, foreign policy 180s and legal quagmires seem to have no discernible political impact. White House releases photos of Kim Jong Un and Pompeo In any other presidency, a Cabinet secretary being skewered on Capitol Hill over massive ethics questions \u2013 such as Environmental Protection Agency Chief Scott Pruitt \u2013 or a nominee such as White House physician Ronny Jackson dropping out of consideration as Veterans Affairs secretary would represent major political crises. Photos like those released Thursday of CIA chief turned new Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meeting the world\u2019s most reclusive leader Kim Jong Un would create news shockwaves that would rumble for weeks. And if any other President had called up a morning news show and unspooled a stream of anger down the phone for half an hour, in a way that may have deepened his legal exposure after the FBI raid on his lawyer Michael Cohen, he would drive his White House close to a cliff edge. In the Trump administration, it\u2019s just another day. Given that expectations of Trump\u2019s presidency are cemented 15 months into his term, it\u2019s likely that none of the turbulence of the last few days \u2013 extreme even by Trump\u2019s standards \u2013 will have an immediate political consequence. Polls show that the President moves in a range between the high mid-30% range and the low to mid-40% territory. The most recent poll of Trump\u2019s approval ratings is by Fox News and shows his number at 44%. In other latest surveys, Quinnipiac puts Trump at 39%, ABC has him at 40% and CNN has the President at 42%. Is Nikki Haley the most popular politician in America? When Trump dips and then picks up the pace in polls, it tends to reflect a drift of softer Republican voters away and back to him \u2013 rather than a realignment of wider sentiment in the electorate. The fact that Trump\u2019s floor remains just below 40% \u2013 while likely insufficient to stave off heavy midterm election losses or fears among his team about his re-election hopes is still remarkable. It speaks to the solidity of his legendary political base, which he has taken pains to preserve and means that his presidency remains viable despite the torrent of logic defying escapades that he engineers every week. So far, the bottom has not fallen out. He\u2019s not experienced the kind of slide for instance that afflicted George W. Bush a year into his second term after the botched handling of Hurricane Katrina and the bloody occupation of Iraq, which at one point would send him down to Gallup approval rating low of 25%. While Trump seems to be defying political gravity, some prominent critics and observers are beginning to worry about longer term damage \u2013 and not to the President\u2019s own political standing. They warn that what is unfolding is potentially damaging to America\u2019s position overseas and the institutions that underpin its democratic system at home. James Comey, the fired FBI chief who has emerged almost as an amateur shrink with his character sketches of the President on his book tour, warned that the abnormality of Trump must not be allowed to become a new normal. Comey's psychoanalysis: Trump's always trying to fill an emotional hole In a CNN town hall event on Thursday Comey was asked by Anderson Cooper about his reaction when he saw Trump tweeting that he should be in jail. He admitted to \u201ca shrug. Like, \u2018Oh, there he goes again,\u2019\u201d Comey said. \u201cAnd then I catch myself, because I hope you\u2019re not shrugging, because that\u2019s numb to something that is not OK, that is not normal,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd Republicans, if they just close their eyes and imagine Barack Obama waking up in the morning saying someone should be in jail, they will understand that it\u2019s not normal.\u201d Comey is not the only person to notice the chaos in Washington. French President Emmanuel Macron, who used a state visit to Washington to intensify his charm offensive with the President, remarked on Wednesday night that dizzying US foreign policy U-turns were \u201cinsane,\u201d the Guardian reported. There were signs on Thursday that some of Trump\u2019s aides in the White House believe that the new political reality \u2013 where none of Trump\u2019s antics appear to hurt him \u2013 can hold for ever, after his tirade on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d which left even the show\u2019s friendly anchors looking puzzled. \u201cLots of people winced,\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta quoted one official as saying when asked about Trump\u2019s unleashed performance, which showed why the President\u2019s lawyers and political team try to keep him under wraps. Trump airs grievances in revealing Fox interview At one point, Trump appeared to be signaling that he wanted to conduct a purge of his own Justice Department \u2013 but couldn\u2019t do so because of the Russia investigation. \u201cI think you\u2019ll understand this, I have decided that I won\u2019t be involved. I may change my mind at some point because what\u2019s going on is a disgrace,\u201d Trump said. Given that special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, the President\u2019s own admission that he would like to strong arm top US law enforcement agencies may be unwise. Trump may also have deepened his legal exposure regarding Cohen. He admitted on Fox for the first time that his lawyer had acted for him in the case of porn star Stormy Daniels, who was paid $130,000 before the election to keep quiet about an alleged affair with Trump. If there are issues with the payment, the President could now find himself being drawn deeper into the legal mess. Trump also caused a problem for his legal team, which is fighting to convince a federal judge that papers seized from Cohen by the FBI should be covered by attorney client privilege. The President told \u201cFox and Friends\u201d that the percentage of his legal work entrusted to Cohen was a \u201ca tiny, tiny little fraction.\u201d Hours later, federal prosecutors said that material obtained by the FBI \u2013 believed to include records of the Trump Organization \u2013 is \u201cunlikely to contain voluminous privileged documents,\u201d using the President\u2019s own words to undermine his legal arguments. Such developments explain why Trump\u2019s legal and political supporters fear the consequences if the President goes anywhere near an interview with Mueller.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump acknowledged for the first time Thursday that his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, is representing him with regards to legal matters involving Stormy Daniels, the porn star who says she had an affair with Trump. On Cohen, the President both solidified his link with Cohen on the Stormy Daniels matter and distanced himself from his personal attorney, whom Trump said has overseen \u201ca tiny, tiny little fraction\u201d of his legal work. But in the process, the President may have inadvertently boosted the arguments of prosecutors who have said that communications between the two men shouldn\u2019t be considered confidential under attorney-client privilege provisions. \u201cHe has a percentage of my overall legal work, a tiny, tiny little fraction, but Michael would represent me and represent me on some things. He represents me like with this crazy Stormy Daniels deal, he represented me. You know, from what I see, he did absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d Trump denies that he told Comey he didn't stay overnight in Moscow The revelation, which came after Cohen asserted his Fifth Amendment rights in the matter, was just one snippet of a rambling, half-hour long phone interview on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d during which the President railed against the FBI and his own Justice Department, rehashed issues involving Hillary Clinton during the presidential campaign and addressed plans for a summit with the North Korean leader. The President appeared animated and agitated during much of the interview, which was reminiscent of his frequent phone-in interviews during the 2016 presidential campaign. Trump was especially animated about the developments involving his attorney and the ongoing special counsel investigation into Russian interference in 2016 and the saga involving his nominee to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson. \u201cDoc Ronny \u2013 you know, we call him Doc Ronny, we call him Admiral Ronny. He\u2019s an admiral, highly respected, a real leader,\u201d Trump said Thursday. \u201cYou know, these are all false accusations that were made. These are false and they\u2019re trying to destroy a man. By the way, I did say welcome to Washington. Welcome to the swamp. Welcome to the world of politics.\u201d From there, Trump jumped to slamming the former FBI director James Comey as a \u201cleaker\u201d and a \u201cliar,\u201d before pivoting to slamming CNN as \u201cfake news\u201d and accusing the Justice Department \u2013 which is led by his political appointees \u2013 of not \u201cdoing their job.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed in my Justice Department but because of the fact that it\u2019s going under, and I think you\u2019ll understand this, I have decided that I won\u2019t be involved. I may change my mind at some point because what\u2019s going on is a disgrace,\u201d Trump said. Trump's Fox comments cited in government proposal over Cohen document review Federal prosecutors quickly seized on Trump\u2019s comments in a court filing Thursday morning, arguing that because Cohen preformed only a \u201ctiny, tiny little fraction\u201d of Trump\u2019s legal work, the documents seized by FBI officials earlier this month are \u201cunlikely to contain voluminous privileged documents.\u201d Daniels\u2019 attorney, Michael Avenatti, also seized on Trump\u2019s comments shortly after the interview concluded. \u201cMr. Trump and Mr. Cohen previously represented to the American people that Mr. Cohen acted on his own and Mr. Trump knew nothing about the agreement with my client, the $130k payment, etc. As I predicted, that has now been shown to be completely false,\u201d Avenatti tweeted. Trump suggested that a lawyer probably advised Cohen to plead the Fifth, adding, \u201cI hope he\u2019s in great shape.\u201d Cohen filed court papers Wednesday indicating he would assert his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination in the Daniels case. He cited FBI raids of his residence, office and hotel room and the seizure of \u201cvarious electronic devices and documents in my possession,\u201d in his filing in US District Court in Los Angeles. Cohen and his attorney, Brent Blakely, have argued that the Daniels civil case should ultimately be sent to private arbitration. Cohen has acknowledged paying Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, $130,000 shortly before the 2016 election to keep quiet about an alleged affair between her and Trump. The White House has said Trump continues to deny that he had an affair with Daniels and the President told reporters earlier this month that he didn\u2019t know about the payment. Trump on summit with Kim Jong Un: 'Maybe the meeting doesn't even take place' Trump also addressed preparations for his upcoming summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, revealing that his CIA Director Mike Pompeo was not initially scheduled to meet with Kim when he headed to Pyongyang earlier this month to lay the groundwork for the summit. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to meet with Kim Jong-Un, but he did,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey got along. They were with each other for, you know, more than an hour. They spoke and he also spoke with his counterparts in North Korea. They had a great meeting.  He then left.\u201d Trump said the timing and location of the summit has yet to be finalized, with five locations and \u201cthree or four dates\u201d under consideration. CNN\u2019s Shimon Prokupecz and Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Fifteen months into Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the United States finds itself on the cusp of a grave constitutional emergency at home \u2013 and closer to stumbling into direct conflict with Russia than at any time since the Cold War. It\u2019s a moment when the chaos, wild rhetoric and crushing of presidential norms on which Trump has anchored his presidency could begin to have real-world consequences with constitutional principles and lives on the line. Washington is reverberating with speculation that Trump, infuriated by revelations emerging from a stunning FBI raid on his personal attorney, could seek to disable or shut down Robert Mueller\u2019s special counsel probe. The rest of the world is braced for an expected strike by the US and its allies against Syria, as Trump taunts Moscow with the prowess of American weaponry and a Kremlin envoy warns that Russia could shoot US missiles down. The picture of an aggressive President openly mulling an audacious power move to end a lawful probe into his campaign, while deliberately stoking tensions in a dangerous war zone, is one that many of his pre-election critics had feared. But it\u2019s also one that Trump\u2019s millions of supporters bought into in 2016. The President\u2019s response opens a window into his character, showing his trust in his own instincts, a desire to project toughness and a refusal to be bound by behavioral constraints observed by his predecessors. Trump has been fuming ever since FBI agents arrived at the door of his lawyer Michael Cohen on Monday, a move that prompted him to angrily denounce what he said was an \u201cattack on our country.\u201d His fury was unlikely to be eased by reports Wednesday that the agents were looking for communications between Cohen and him about the infamous \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, which featured vulgar Trump remarks about women. Even before those revelations, sources told CNN that Trump was already convinced that Mueller, who referred information about Cohen to prosecutors in New York, had busted out of his lane of probing alleged Russian election collusion. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Wednesday that the President has \u201cvery deep concern about the direction that the special counsel and other investigations have taken.\u201d CNN reported Tuesday that Trump was considering a step many of his opponents fear \u2013 removing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller probe, in an attempt to either neuter the special counsel or to dismiss him entirely and end his probe. \u201cEither of those actions are designed to interfere with an investigation that may implicate the President,\u201d House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cThat is obstruction of justice \u2026. it deeply worries me because it would throw this country into complete crisis,\u201d the California Democrat said. Democrats would be certain to call for impeachment proceedings in such circumstances, even if Republicans who control the House seem unlikely to agree. Some top GOP senators, however, have warned that firing Mueller would be \u201csuicide\u201d for Trump and would mean the beginning of the end of his presidency. The Trump era has been packed with shocks and unpredictable turns, but the raid by FBI agents Monday on the personal lawyer of the President of the United States left many people in Washington shaking their heads in disbelief. It also raised genuine questions about whether it was justified, despite being endorsed by Rosenstein and a judge in New York. \u201cThe attorney-client privilege is sacrosanct here. There is the crime fraud exception \u2013 the only time you get to pierce that attorney-client privilege is if there is a crime committed,\u201d said David Urban, a CNN political commentator who ran Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign in Pennsylvania. \u201cThis is a pretty high bar stuff and we will have to see, but it is an extraordinary step to be taken, for sure,\u201d Urban told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead.\u201d CNN reporting indicates that New York prosecutors were also seeking information about payments made to two women who alleged that they had affairs with Trump a decade before the election. The prosecutorial strategy was not immediately clear. But Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal suggested on CNN that it was possible agents were seeking evidence of obstruction of justice or were seeking to protect evidence. The deepening legal mire facing the President and the apparently looming military strike in Syria converged in Monday\u2019s stunning rant about his legal plight before a room full of top military brass. The meeting reflected how Trump is preparing to order American forces into action against an extraordinary backdrop of domestic political turmoil. Concern about the gravity of the potential strikes, to punish an alleged chemical weapons attack on Syrian civilians by President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s forces, escalated amid a US-Russia war of words on Wednesday. After Russia\u2019s ambassador in Lebanon warned that Moscow could shoot down US cruise missiles and retaliate against launch sites \u2013 possibly US ships and submarines \u2013 Trump hit back. Far from easing tensions with America\u2019s nuclear-armed rival, as most presidents may have done, he sent them into overdrive. \u201cRussia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia,  because they will be coming, nice and new and \u2018smart!\u2019 You shouldn\u2019t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!\u201d Trump tweeted. On the one hand, the tweet could be put down to Trump\u2019s unique and unconventional way of communicating, which infuriates the Washington establishment and delights his supporters. Yet such talk, on the question of military action in a region where American and Russian forces are nudging up against each other, is not the kind of rhetoric that is normal from a president. \u201cHe\u2019s the commander in chief. I can\u2019t remember ever in my lifetime or certainly in my study of American history a commander in chief treating the potential use of armed force in this cavalier a fashion,\u201d said retired Rear Adm. John Kirby, a CNN national security analyst and former State Department spokesman. \u201cIt is irresponsible that he would just tweet out something specific about a strike when lives are at stake, not just lives on the ground, but American lives and probably allied lives,\u201d he said. The tweet is also not consistent with Trump\u2019s own oft-stated promise never to tip his hand on the possibility of military action in order to avoid giving regimes like the one in Syria time to move military hardware out of harm\u2019s way. Still, some of Trump\u2019s defenders might note the irony of the media, which have spent months wondering why Trump has been soft on Russia, highlighting tough rhetoric directed at the Kremlin over its support of Assad.",

Attorney\u2013client privilege is dead! Trump also tweeted \u201cA TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!,\u201d apparently referencing special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!! Sources inside the White House have told CNN that Trump sees the move against Cohen as proof that Mueller has leaped far beyond the constraints of his original probe into whether his campaign operatives colluded with Russia. One source familiar with the matter told CNN included in the documents authorities seized was information related to porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, who alleges she had an affair with Trump in 2006 that the White House has denied. However, attorney-client privilege, which Trump suggested was violated by the raid, does not apply if the attorney-client communication was made in the furtherance of a crime. Cohen, alongside Trump, is ensnared in a legal battle over the sourcing of a $130,000 \u201chush agreement\u201d payment to Daniels less than two weeks before the 2016 presidential election. Any involvement by Trump could suggest the payment was an in-kind campaign contribution which was not disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, which would be a violation of federal law, according to Paul S. Ryan, a campaign finance attorney who works for Common Cause. The FBI seizure included bank records, a source said. On Monday, Trump also called the raid a \u201cdisgraceful situation\u201d and \u201can attack on our country.\u201d Asked if he would fire Mueller, he said: \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d While that could have the effect of putting a screeching halt to the investigation, some members of Congress, including Republicans, have said that Mueller\u2019s termination could lead to impeachment proceedings.

            "article_content": "Had she planned to run for Congress, Laura Moser says, she never would have written the articles the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used to try to sink her candidacy in a Democratic primary here. But she also says the bluntness with which she wrote that Washington residents need to get over high housing prices \u2013 and that she\u2019d rather have a tooth pulled without anesthesia than live in rural Paris, Texas \u2013 might be her strongest asset. \u201cI\u2019m a flawed person. I have not been on this path,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I also think people like that.\u201d Moser and attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher are headed toward a May 22 runoff that Democrats everywhere will be watching as the party selects its candidate to oppose Rep. John Culberson for his western Harris County 7th District seat. Long a Republican stronghold, the seat suddenly looks up for grabs: Hillary Clinton narrowly beat President Donald Trump here in 2016, and diverse, suburban regions have shown the strongest shifts in Democrats\u2019 direction in statewide and special elections since then. First, though, comes a test of what type of candidate Democrats will offer in November\u2019s midterm elections. Moser is an internet-era progressive brawler \u2013 a favorite of Berniecrats and endorsed by the Bernie Sanders-aligned Our Revolution. Shortly after Trump\u2019s election, she launched Daily Action, which sends mobile phone alerts urging progressives to take a simple action each morning. She is married to former Obama White House videographer and Sanders 2016 campaign staffer Arun Chaudhary, and has lived in Washington. Fletcher, meanwhile, is a Houston attorney who fits the more typical mold of Democratic congressional candidates. She\u2019s a longtime Planned Parenthood advocate \u2013 a reality she highlighted in her first campaign ad \u2013 and is endorsed by EMILY\u2019s List. The two advanced out of a seven-way primary on March 6. Neither cleared 50%; Fletcher was the leading vote-getter at 29%, while Moser finished second with 24%, so they will face off again May 22. In an interview in Moser\u2019s campaign headquarters, a former bridal shop with mannequins and mirrors still scattered in between tables of campaign staffers and volunteers, she said she regretted the November 2014 article that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee cited in its unusually direct attack on her candidacy in February. \u201cI needed the money,\u201d she said, laughing. But she also cast herself as a dramatic break from what many progressives have complained are milquetoast recruits for key House races.\u201d \u201cIf you don\u2019t agree with me on everything, I\u2019m not going to lie to you, and I will listen, and we can talk, and I\u2019m not going to give some weird mumbo jumbo non-answer to a question,\u201d Moser said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what people like about Trump, too.\u201d \u201cHe just says whatever. And I\u2019m not comparing myself to him, but I just do think this is a time for authenticity in politics and that people care about that more than where you fall on their long, ideological checklist,\u201d she said. In a signal that its heavy-handed intervention in the March primary triggered intense blowback \u2013 and a recognition that the local AFL-CIO has backed Moser \u2013 the DCCC is so far keeping a much lower profile headed into the runoff. It recently offered de facto endorsements to candidates for two other Texas congressional seats, adding them to its \u201cRed to Blue\u201d program for top-tier challengers, even though those two candidates also face runoffs. But it left Fletcher out of the program. Their differences on the issues are relatively small: Moser backs single-payer health care and warns that climate change poses an urgent threat, despite Houston\u2019s oil-heavy economy. But Fletcher, too, is a strident critic of President Donald Trump. They both attended St. John\u2019s School, a private preparatory school in the district. And in interviews Thursday, neither even used the other\u2019s name. Instead, Fletcher is accusing Culberson of being missing in action in the district, a criticism that also implicitly draws a contrast with Moser, who has lived in Washington and recently returned to Houston to run for Congress. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Houstonian,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cNot only was I born and raised here, but I chose to live here as an adult and to make my life and career here.\u201d \u201cI have had the privilege of representing people in court from all walks of life, from across the district and across the city, and that experience is really what I think is the focus in the race,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s what\u2019s going to help me beat Culberson, and it\u2019s what\u2019s going to help me serve effectively in Congress.\u201d Both Fletcher and Moser said they rarely hear about the DCCC and the national implications of the race from voters. \u201cYes, of course it has been in the national media, but that\u2019s really not what it\u2019s like on the ground, and we\u2019re really focused on not getting distracted by that conversation and focused on communicating with voters, getting our message out,\u201d Fletcher said. The two candidates identified infrastructure issues \u2013 both had roadwork blocking areas near the entries to their campaign headquarters \u2013 and complained that Culberson hadn\u2019t done enough to secure funding for hurricane recovery efforts. Fletcher is highlighting an endorsement from a local LGBT advocacy group and said she\u2019s volunteered for Planned Parenthood for 25 years. Moser, meanwhile, recently attracted scrutiny by hiring Leah McElrath, another aggressive Democratic writer who has promoted liberal conspiracy theories about Trump and brawled with former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile on Twitter. McElrath described Trump\u2019s election as \u201ca coup by white supremacists backed by a foreign authoritarian power.\u201d Her hiring was the subject of a Houston Chronicle report. Shortly afterward, Moser said, McElrath resigned. \u201cWe brought her on just to help us with a few things, and when the article came out she said she didn\u2019t want to be a distraction, so she\u2019s no longer with the campaign,\u201d she said. Moser added: \u201cShe was great.\u201d Moser said McElrath\u2019s previous comments didn\u2019t bother her. \u201cI think saying that Russians interfered in our election is not controversial,\u201d she said. \u201cAsk Bob Mueller if that\u2019s controversial.\u201d",

The timeline was expedited as they both felt it was important to have the new team in place, instead of constant speculation,\u201d a White House official said. \u201cThis was not related to any one moment or incident, rather it was the result of ongoing conversations between the two.\u201d READ: H.R. McMaster's departure email to the NSC \u201cAfter 34 years of service to our nation, I am requesting retirement from the U.S. Army effective this summer after which I will leave public service. Throughout my career it has been my greatest privilege to serve alongside extraordinary servicemembers and dedicated civilians,\u201d McMaster said in a statement released by the White House. \u201cI am thankful to President Donald J. Trump for the opportunity to serve him and our nation as national security advisor. I am grateful for the friendship and support of the members of the National Security Council who worked together to provide the President with the best options to protect and advance our national interests,\u201d the statement said. Trump and Bolton have been discussing for weeks how he could replace McMaster. According to a source familiar with those negotiations, Bolton promised Trump \u201che wouldn\u2019t start any wars\u201d if he was selected. Shortly after the news broke, Bolton said on Fox News that he wasn\u2019t expecting an announcement to be made Thursday afternoon. Asked when he was offered the job, Bolton said \u201cit came to a conclusion this afternoon.\u201d CNN also confirmed that Bolton met with Trump Thursday. White House officials told CNN that they were surprised by Trump\u2019s acceleration of the announcement, saying it was unexpected, and one official added that the choice of Bolton was expected to be part of a bigger release. An official said the blowback over Trump\u2019s call to Russian President Vladimir Putin on his reelection sped up the announcement. One official also said Trump was eager to get ahead of other news. Bolton said in the Fox News interview that he will be going through a transition period \u2013 which will include working with McMaster \u2013 before taking over on April 9. Bolton\u2019s hard edged, hawkish views on issues like North Korea, Iraq and Syria make him a controversial pick to become the next national security adviser \u2013 particularly considering that talks with North Korea may soon be possible. Several sources have told CNN that Defense Secretary James Mattis opposed the pick and tried to block Bolton from getting the job. Bolton said on Fox News Thursday that he and Mattis have never met. The Pentagon said it does not have an official comment to make at this time. Megan Stifel, a former NSC staffer during the Obama administration responded to the news by simply tweeting: \u201cNow I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Early in the Trump administration Bolton \u2013 a stalwart of several Republican administrations \u2013 was considered as a possible secretary of state and since then has made visits to the West Wing every few months to discuss foreign policy and national security. A source familiar with those meetings said the two have spent more time recently getting to know each other, discussing Bolton\u2019s views and getting a better sense of each other. Initially there was a concern that Bolton had not made it clear enough that, if tapped, he would \u201cabsolutely go along with Trump,\u201d a source close to Bolton told CNN, adding that during their last meeting he went over and above to make clear he will do exactly what Trump wants. Bolton said on Fox News that  he has been a prolific speaker and writer for years in Washington, but said that his past comments are now \u201cbehind me\u201d and what matters is \u201cwhat the President says.\u201d After the two met in the Oval Office last week, a source close to the President said: \u201cTrump has always wanted Bolton.\u201d John Bolton's mustache is more qualified to be national security adviser than he is Despite once bemoaning Bolton\u2019s thick mustache as unbefitting of a senior White House official, Trump has now determined he can look past it, one person familiar with his thinking said. Amid speculation about McMaster\u2019s fate CNN has reported that the three-star general has been in discussions with the Hoover Institution.  As recently as March 8, the White House was denying reports that McMaster was on his way out, with spokeswoman Sarah Sanders declaring on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that \u201cGeneral McMaster\u2019s not going anywhere.\u201d CNN reported earlier this month that the Pentagon has also been considering options that would allow the President to potentially move McMaster out of his current role and back into the military, according to half a dozen defense and administration officials. Sources: Trump ready to replace H.R. McMaster as national security adviser And the Pentagon had been quietly looking to see if there is a four-star military job suited for McMaster, these officials said. But McMaster\u2019s announced retirement from the military this summer would mean he wouldn\u2019t receive his fourth star. National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton had dismissed reports of McMaster\u2019s departure, telling CNN on March 1 that Trump had dismissed stories of McMaster\u2019s ouster as \u201c\u2018fake news,\u2019 and told McMaster that he is doing a great job.\u201d Several sources told CNN that the decision came after months of personal tension between McMaster and Trump. Trump has privately expressed irritation with McMaster stemming from differences in \u201cpersonality and style,\u201d a senior Republican source said. The two have never gotten along, and Trump continues to chafe at McMaster\u2019s demeanor when he briefs him, feeling that he is gruff and condescending, according to a source who is familiar with his thinking. Sources with knowledge of McMaster\u2019s standing in the White House had repeatedly said that he was on thin ice. That building frustration was again on display this week after after it quickly leaked that Trump had been directly instructed by his national security advisers not to congratulate Russian President Vladimir Putin on his recent election victory. Trump furious over leak of warning to not congratulate Putin Trump was furious \u2013 asking White House aides and allies if they thought it was \u201ca McMaster person\u201d who had leaked it to the press, a source familiar with how things unfolded said. There was discussion in the West Wing about replacing him last fall, but he ultimately survived because officials, including the President himself, were skeptical about the optics of appointing a third national security adviser in less than a year, several sources told CNN. Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned amid controversy over his contact with Russian officials within a month of taking the job. McMaster was also retained at the time because of the White House\u2019s challenge attracting top talent for jobs in the administration due to Trump\u2019s \u201cblacklist\u201d of individuals who have criticized the President, his personality and the Russia investigation, according to a senior Republican source.

            "article_content": "Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon said Thursday that if John Kelly, the current White House chief of staff, were to leave, he does \u201cnot believe there will be another chief of staff.\u201d During the Financial Times\u2019 \u201cFuture of News\u201d conference in New York, Bannon said he thinks President Donald Trump will instead choose to have \u201cfive or six direct reports\u201d from key members of his staff, similar to how business was conducted at Trump Tower. Inside the Trump campaign's ties with Cambridge Analytica \u201cI think the President is a very hands-on manager and feels more comfortable\u201d with such a style, Bannon said, adding that he thinks Kelly put \u201ctoo much\u201d structure into the White House. \u201cReince (Priebus\u2019) style was a little bit more like President Trump was used to. General Kelly came in and it was completely different, very ordered, very structured,\u201d Bannon added. \u201cI think we\u2019ve seen a reaction to that and I believe you\u2019re going to see the President much more directly in contact with staff people.\u201d In his wide-ranging interview Thursday, Bannon also said he does not think the President\u2019s recent agreement to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will come to fruition, saying that if he were a \u201cbetting man\u201d he\u2019d wager that it would not happen because of logistics for both parties. Bannon was harshly criticized by the President after the book Michael Wolff\u2019s book \u201cFire and Fury\u201d was published earlier this year, in which the former aide was quoted as saying unflattering things about the Trump White House. But the former Breitbart executive chairman told the crowd Thursday that he does not regret being the primary source for the book. \u201cI have not seen anybody refute anything that was said in the book,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cI have not read the book, but no, I don\u2019t regret it. It is what it is.\u201d Following his appearance at the conference, CNN\u2019s Dana Bash asked Bannon, who once served as a Cambridge Analytica vice president, if he knew the firm was using personal information from Facebook. \u201cThat Facebook data, by the way, is for sale all over the world,\u201d Bannon responded, later adding, \u201cI don\u2019t remember buying it. That was the Cambridge guy.\u201d Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign hired the firm for the 2016 election. Other high-profile Republican campaigns and political groups also used its services in past election cycles. During his appearance, Bannon addressed recent reports that Cambridge Analytica misused Facebook users\u2019 data. \u201cThe point is, that is Facebook\u2019s business. In 2008, it was Google and Facebook that went to Barack Obama and met him at San Francisco airport and told him all about the power of this personal data,\u201d Bannon said, adding that \u201cthe great opposition party \u2013 media \u2013 never went after the Obama campaign, never went after the progressive left as they\u2019ve been doing this for years. And in 2013, when I thought a data company might be important, all the sudden it becomes global news.\u201d In the book, Bannon called the 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian lawyer purportedly offering damaging information about Hillary Clinton \u201ctreasonous\u201d but later expressed regret over the comment. Bannon also said he believes Trump is \u201cgoing to war\u201d over special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe following John Dowd\u2019s resignation Thursday as Trump\u2019s leading lawyer in the inquiry. \u201cJohn Dowd is a good man,\u201d Bannon said, adding that \u201cmore aggressive attorneys got brought in.\u201d Bannon said that Trump lawyers \u201cTy Cobb and John Dowd had a radical theory.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s totally cooperate and waive executive privilege, OK? I have said, as I told the President and told everybody \u2013 and I told brother Dowd, I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "A crowded Democratic House primary in the Houston area has become a stand-in for the broader battle within the party between progressives who backed Bernie Sanders and members of the establishment. The controversy erupted more than a week ago, when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s political arm for House races, unleashed a scathing attack against journalist and activist Laura Moser, one of seven candidates in the Texas 7th District Democratic primary to take on Republican Rep. John Culberson this fall. Now, with two days left before the Texas primary on Tuesday, the infighting has opened wounds within the Democratic Party that never quite healed after the 2016 election, when Sanders supporters accused the Democratic National Committee of tipping the scales in favor of Hillary Clinton. And the fighting could go on past Tuesday: If none of the four leading candidates top 50%, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff six weeks later. Tensions flare among Democrats as primaries approach Central to the DCCC\u2019s case against Moser is a 2014 Washingtonian article in which she wrote that she\u2019d \u201csooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\u201d than live in Paris, Texas.\u00a0The committee feared the article was ready-made for scathing attack ads casting Moser as a DC-loving, Texas-loathing carpetbagger \u2013 the kind that her campaign might never be able to overcome.\u00a0Attorney Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, nonprofit executive Alex Triantaphyllis and oncologist Jason Westin are others seen as leading candidates. \u201cDemocratic voters need to hear that Laura Moser is not going to change Washington. She is a Washington insider, who begrudgingly moved to Houston to run for Congress,\u201d the DCCC said on its website as it posted a bundle of research critical of Moser. But progressive activists were incensed to see the DCCC \u2013 which has long been accused of recruiting too many moderate, milquetoast candidates and weighing fundraising potential too heavily in deciding who to back \u2013 weigh in with such a heavy hand less than three weeks from the March 6 contest. Our Revolution, the political organization that controls Bernie Sanders\u2019 massive email list, endorsed Moser on Thursday. \u201cThe DCCC\u2019s ridiculous attacks on Laura Moser are why Democrats nationally have lost over 1,100 seats,\u201d said Jim Hightower, an Our Revolution board member. \u201cThe people of Texas should be allowed to make their own decisions on who to vote for without the influence of Washington insiders.\u201d Our Revolution, along with two other progressive groups, Justice Democrats and CREDO, have also launched a petition aimed at DCCC chairman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, telling him to \u201cstop attacking progressives in the Democratic Party.\u201d DNC Chairman Tom Perez, who has said the national party will remain neutral in primaries, also took a shot at the DCCC. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have done it,\u201d Perez said on C-SPAN\u2019s \u201cNewsmakers\u201d\u00a0on Friday. \u201cI would have done it differently,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the DCCC has the ability to endorse in primaries, and they do that from time to time. But again, I would have done it differently.\u201d Moser released her own ad highlighting the controversy Friday, saying the Democratic primary is about \u201crejecting the system where Washington party bosses tell us who to choose.\u201d \u201cWe tried that before and look where it got us,\u201d she says in the ad, making a clear reference to the party\u2019s 2016 presidential primary. A longtime ally and adviser to Clinton, Neera Tanden, responded to Moser\u2019s ad on Twitter, writing, \u201cHonestly asking @lcmoser- do you mean this as an attack on @HillaryClinton or are you referencing something else? I\u2019m definitely against party bosses choosing nominees but I don\u2019t know when that last happened.\u201d In recent days, backlash over the 2014 Washington article written by Moser and highlighted by the DCCC has extended beyond the DCCC. In it, Moser referred to living \u201cdirectly next door to a deaf-mute drug addict\u201d \u2013 a comment that The Daily Moth, a news outlet for the deaf, highlighted as offensive. Moser apologized for language she said was \u201cextremely inappropriate and insensitive, and I regret it deeply.\u201d \u201cI try to be an ally, but I am still learning,\u201d she said. Kandice Webber, an organizer of Saturday\u2019s March for Black Women in Houston \u2013 of which Moser was a sponsor \u2013 also took issue with Moser\u2019s 2014 article, in which she argued that Washington residents should get over their city\u2019s high housing prices. She told BuzzFeed\u2019s Alexis Levinson that in the article, Moser was \u201ccompletely tone deaf and it just, it reeked of white privilege.\u201d She said Moser \u201chas no business\u201d representing Texas\u2019s 7th District. \u201cIf I had read that article this time last week, she would not be sponsoring,\u201d Webber said. \u201cI am a little uncomfortable with it because I think that at this point, she needs to answer for what she does.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hope Hicks has occasionally told fibs on behalf of her boss, but they only amounted to white lies, according to what little we\u2019ve heard spill out after her closed-door testimony Tuesday with congressional investigators. She did not answer questions about her time at the White House, joining former President Donald Trump aide Steve Bannon in claiming those communications are privileged. And she was reticent at first to discuss the transition period. It\u2019s not exactly clear when the white lies may have occurred. Hicks argued she hasn\u2019t had to lie about substantive issues for Trump, according to the source with knowledge of her Tuesday comments that spoke to CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb. That the White House communications director should have to lie on behalf of her boss, who is a serial boaster, stretcher of the truth and documented outright fibber, should not be surprising. That she would admit to even the smallest fib in the context of testimony about Russian election meddling is something else entirely. Even a white lie implies intentional misleading. While Hicks\u2019 testimony was not before special counsel Robert Mueller, he is unlikely to take very kindly to lies, even those of the white variety. Lying to the FBI \u2013 if that\u2019s what happened here \u2013 is no joke. Witness: Three people tied to the Trump campaign (former national security adviser Michael Flynn, former campaign official Rick Gates and former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos) have pleaded guilty as part of Mueller\u2019s probe. All of them admitted lying to the FBI. A Dutch lawyer, the son-in-law of a Russian billionaire, has also pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI as part of the special counsel inquiry. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Tal Yellin and Liz Stark have tracked all of the developments. It\u2019s also against the law to lie to Congress. Even for a President or his staffers. The impeachment charges pass in the House against Bill Clinton back in 1998? One was for lying under oath to a federal grand jury about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. The other was for obstruction \u2013 inducing others to lie on his behalf about the affair. We should add here the normal caution that we\u2019ve documented before: we\u2019re still a long, long, long way from any possibility of the kind of serious impeachment effort against Trump. But it\u2019s because they worry he might lie to Mueller that Trump\u2019s aides have tried to sway him against an interview with Mueller\u2019s team, according The New York Times. His lawyers have argued to Mueller\u2019s team they have not met the threshold to have such a meeting. Lies are often the thing in Washington. Kushner, Russia bombshells rock the White House Former Gen. James Cartwright leaked information to journalists. But it was lying about the leaks that drew his guilty plea in 2016. It was lies that brought down Scooter Libby during the George W. Bush administration. There are a lot of things we don\u2019t know about the white lies Hicks described behind closed doors on Capitol Hill, including the context around which Hicks admitted them. That\u2019s extremely important information that will hopefully come out very soon. Maybe there\u2019s a reasonable explanation for all of this. It\u2019s also not clear what Hicks may have said to Mueller\u2019s team. She was scheduled to be interviewed late in 2017, after charges had been brought against Gates and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the guilty plea of Papadopoulos. Gates changed to a guilty plea earlier this month. The White House doesn\u2019t want staffers to talk in case they one day want to exert executive privilege, which is sort of a backhand way of trying to exert executive privilege without actually doing it.",

            "article_content": "During closed-door testimony that stretched roughly nine hours Tuesday, White House communications director Hope Hicks was pressed about whether she had ever lied for President Donald Trump \u2013 and acknowledged she has had to tell what amounted to white lies, according to a source with direct knowledge of her testimony. But Hicks argued that she hasn\u2019t had to lie about substantive issues for Trump, the source said. Hicks, however, would not answer questions about her time in the White House during her House Intelligence Committee testimony as part of the panel\u2019s Russia investigation, though she did answer some questions about the presidential transition, according to lawmakers on the committee. The New York Times first reported that Hicks admitted to white lies on the President\u2019s behalf. Hicks is the latest senior official in the Trump orbit to decline to address questions about events that occurred after the 2016 election, as former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski have made similar claims during testimony before the House panel. Hicks\u2019 testimony was more forthcoming than that of Bannon \u2013 who would answer questions only about the campaign \u2013 but Democrats said she failed to answer key questions by walling off her time at the White House, arguing that other administration officials did not take a broad view about what they could not discuss. House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff said Hicks would not discuss, for instance, her role in drafting the misleading statement from Donald Trump Jr. about the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian lawyer. \u201cAll of our questions about what went into that statement went unanswered,\u201d the California Democrat said. Hicks did tell the committee that the first time she learned about the Trump Tower meeting was in June 2017, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN. While she was in Trump Tower that day in June 2016, Hicks said, she did not have any awareness that the meeting took place, the sources said. Initially Hicks told the committee she would not discuss the transition at all, citing a White House request, according to lawmakers. But she then agreed to answer some questions about the transition after conferring with the White House, because she had answered them previously before the Senate Intelligence Committee \u2013 although Schiff said there were transition questions not asked by the Senate that she still would not address. Schiff said Democrats pushed for the committee to subpoena Hicks \u201con the spot\u201d to compel her testimony, but Republicans did not agree to do so. Hicks did not invoke executive privilege, but she said she had been instructed by the White House not to answer the questions, Schiff said. When Bannon appeared before the committee last month and didn\u2019t answer questions beyond the 2016 campaign, he was hit with a subpoena during the interview. Republicans said Bannon\u2019s claim that he could invoke executive privilege during the presidential transition did not have merit. \u201cThere\u2019s apparently one rule for Steve Bannon and another rule for everyone else,\u201d Schiff said. But Republicans said Hicks was a different case because she was willing to answer some questions about the transition. \u201cMr. Bannon was claiming a privilege based on the transition that we were asking what the privilege was and we weren\u2019t comfortable that there was such a privilege,\u201d said Rep. Tom Rooney, a Florida Republican. \u201cSince she has decided to answer questions based on that transition, she cannot be compared to Mr. Bannon, so it\u2019s not the same.\u201d Rep. Trey Gowdy, a South Carolina Republican, said his issue was more with the White House\u2019s stance on the transition period, rather than with Hicks. Earlier on Tuesday, other Democrats on the committee were also pushing for the panel to subpoena Hicks for not responding to its questions. \u201cWe got Bannon-ed,\u201d said Rep. Denny Heck, a Washington state Democrat. \u201cI have less hope we\u2019ll get to all the answers,\u201d said Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat. \u201cAs with anyone who doesn\u2019t answer questions, they ought to be subpoenaed.\u201d Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican leading the House Intelligence Committee\u2019s Russia investigation, told CNN ahead of the meeting that he expected Hicks to answer all of the committee\u2019s questions. He declined to comment Tuesday afternoon on Hicks\u2019 testimony or a possible subpoena, saying he would wait until the interview had concluded. Bannon returned to the committee under subpoena earlier this month to continue his testimony, and he told the panel he had been instructed by the White House to invoke executive privilege on behalf of Trump. Schiff has called for Bannon to be held in contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions, as well as Lewandowski, who also limited the scope of questions he would answer. Conaway said Tuesday that he has to discuss the matter with House Speaker Paul Ryan before deciding how to proceed. Quigley said Hicks had not asserted privilege Tuesday, but she was \u201cfollowing the orders of the White House not to answer certain questions.\u201d Hicks did not answer reporters\u2019 questions on her way into the interview Tuesday morning. She was initially scheduled to appear before the committee last month as part of the panel\u2019s investigation into Russian meddling in the US election, but her interview was delayed over questions about the scope of her testimony. Hicks also met last year with special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his investigation. Hicks, a trusted Trump aide for years, was one of then-candidate Trump\u2019s first hires as he put together an improbable run for the White House. During the campaign, she was often by Trump\u2019s side and attended nearly every rally, while she was in frequent communication with other senior officials as they coordinated their tactics to win the White House. The House panel planned to interview her about any knowledge she has of contacts that occurred between other Trump associates and Russians. Hicks appears to have firsthand knowledge of a number of key events that have shaped the first year of the Trump White House, including being on Air Force One when the initial misleading statement about Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with Russians was crafted. This story has been updated with developments from Tuesday. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell, Dana Bash and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee decided he will not run for re-election after reconsidering his decision to retire last year, his chief of staff said Tuesday. His decision puts an end to months of speculation that he might reverse his decision to retire. \u201cOver the past several months, Senator Corker has been encouraged by people across Tennessee and in the Senate to reconsider his decision not to seek re-election,\u201d his chief of staff Todd Womack said in a statement. \u201cHowever, at the end of the day, the senator believes he made the right decision in September and will be leaving the Senate when his term expires at the end of 2018.\u201d Corker had conversations with a few colleagues earlier this month about whether he should reconsider his decision to not seek re-election this year, GOP sources told CNN. Corker\u2019s decision sets up a likely general election between GOP Rep. Marsha Blackburn and former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a 74-year-old Democrat who has won twice statewide before but last ran for office in 2006. Blackburn thanked Corker for his \u201cdedicated service\u201d in the Senate in a statement Tuesday. \u201cI want to thank Senator Corker for his dedicated service on behalf of Tennessee families,\u201d Blackburn said. \u201cNow, we can unify the Republican party and focus on defeating Democrat Phil Bredesen in November.\u201d Former Rep. Stephen Fincher had also entered the Republican primary, but dropped out last week, encouraging Corker to run. News that Corker would stand by his decision to not seek re-election was first reported by Politico on Tuesday. Corker, who was at one time among those considered a candidate to be President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state, was critical of the President before announcing he wouldn\u2019t seek re-election in September. The relationship\u2019s fallout started over the summer, when Corker criticized Trump\u2019s response to the deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, when the President placed equal blame on anti-white supremacist demonstrators and neo-Nazi sympathizers. Trump responded by bashing Corker on Twitter, but the two men met at the White House in the fall after the controversy died down. Sources familiar with their discussions confirmed to CNN in January that Corker had repaired his relationship with the commander in chief. \u201cWhen he ran for the Senate in 2006, he told Tennesseans that he couldn\u2019t imagine serving for more than two terms because he has always been drawn to the citizen legislator model and believes public service should be missional,\u201d Womack said in the statement on Corker Tuesday. \u201cThis has been the greatest privilege of his life and he is forever grateful to the people of the Volunteer State for the opportunity to serve our state and country.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team questioned former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon for hours over two days this week, according to a person familiar with the inquiry. Bannon is one of the few individuals in President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle to be interviewed by Mueller\u2019s team, which is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. He played a key role in the final weeks of the presidential campaign, attended meetings during the transition that are now under scrutiny, and continued in a top advisory role in the West Wing until he left in August. Mueller\u2019s investigators were expected to ask Bannon about the firings of FBI Director James Comey and national security adviser Michael Flynn, people familiar with the inquiry previously told CNN. Bannon answered all questions posed by the special counsel\u2019s team, this person said. No areas or questions were off limits. That differed from his appearance Thursday before the House Intelligence Committee, in which Bannon frustrated lawmakers from both parties by informing them that he had been instructed by the White House to invoke executive privilege to lawmakers on behalf of the President, and declined to answer questions about his time during the transition and in the administration. Bannon declined to answer a wide array of lawmakers\u2019 questions pertinent to the Russia investigation, prompting them to consider holding him in contempt. Bannon stonewalls House panel after WH advised him to invoke executive privilege Mueller is currently investigating any potential ties between Trump associates and Russia during the 2016 campaign \u2013 his is one of several inquiries into the matter. The former Breitbart News executive\u2019s propensity for speaking bluntly and in colorful fashion provides a roadmap for Mueller\u2019s investigators to use. He made wide-ranging comments in Michael Wolff\u2019s book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House,\u201d saying Trump \u201ckept trying\u201d to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin after Trump was rebuffed during his trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in December 2013. Bannon also claimed that Mueller\u2019s investigation is sure to lead back to money laundering. \u201cYou realize where this is going. \u2026 This is all about money laundering,\u201d Bannon is quoted as saying in Wolff\u2019s book. \u201cMueller chose (senior prosecutor Andrew) Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy. Their path to f***ing Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner. \u2026 It\u2019s as plain as a hair on your face.\u201d Investigators were likely to press Bannon over the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr., Trump son-in-law Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Bannon was aware of other meetings that are of interest to Mueller. For instance, Bannon was forwarded an email during the transition detailing the plan for then-incoming national security adviser Flynn to talk with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions, according to The New York Times. One of the other lingering questions in the Russia investigation is whether there was any collusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign\u2019s data team and the Russian government, which also used social media to target specific voters during the campaign. Both sides flatly deny any collusion. Before joining the Trump campaign, Bannon was on the board of Cambridge Analytica, a data company that worked on the campaign. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who contacted WikiLeaks in June 2016 to ask about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, testified before the House Intelligence Committee in December. And Mueller asked for the company\u2019s emails last fall, according to The Wall Street Journal. Just three months after Nix contacted WikiLeaks, it exchanged private messages on Twitter with Trump Jr. In most of the messages from late September 2016, which Trump Jr. later released to the public, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share its materials on social media. Trump Jr. sent an email about the conversation to Bannon and a group of other senior Trump campaign officials, according to The Atlantic, and Mueller could press for additional information on those exchanges. Cambridge Analytica spokesman Nick Fievet said the company tried to get in touch with WikiLeaks indirectly. Cambridge Analytica \u201cspoke once on the phone with a speakers bureau \u200bthat represents WikiLeaks\u2019 Julian Assange to ask for information after Assange claimed on British TV to possess leaked material related to the election, without saying where it had come from or what was in it,\u201d Fievet said. \u200b\u201dThe speakers bureau told us that WikiLeaks declined to speak with us,\u201d he said. During the presidential transition, Bannon also attended one meeting that potentially triggered a series of events \u2013 stretching all the way to a tiny island chain in the Indian Ocean \u2013 which congressional investigators are scrutinizing. In December 2016, Bannon joined Kushner and Flynn for a meeting at Trump Tower with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi. After the meeting, Erik Prince \u2013 a businessman, Trump donor and Bannon ally \u2013 reached out to the prince and said he had authorization to act as an informal emissary for Trump, according to The Washington Post. Prince, founder of the private security company Blackwater USA and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, flew to the Seychelles one month later and met Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, according to Prince\u2019s testimony at the House Intelligence Committee. Prince and the White House both deny that the Trump transition had anything to do with the planning of the meeting. Prince testified that it was purely a business meeting and that nobody authorized him to represent the Trump team. Mueller\u2019s team could also question Bannon about his interactions with Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos, who pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russians. He is now cooperating with Mueller\u2019s investigation. CNN\u2019s Sophie Tatum, Sara Murray and Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bannon's attorney has said that his client will not be able to use the protections of executive privilege Last week Bannon infuriated lawmakers from both parties after he refused to answer questions Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team wants to question former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon about the firings of national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James Comey, according to two people familiar with the investigation. Bannon is set to interview with Mueller by the end of the month, these people say, as the special counsel\u2019s investigation moves closer to President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was a witness to the firing of Comey, was interviewed last week, the Justice Department confirmed Tuesday. In addition to the Comey and Flynn firings, key issues from Bannon\u2019s time in the White House are likely to include Trump\u2019s decision to fire then-acting Attorney General Sally Yates and any pressure the President may have exerted on Sessions about the FBI investigation into Russia\u2019s interference with the election. Day of bombshells takes Mueller probe to critical point Bannon\u2019s attorney has said that his client will not be able to use the protections of executive privilege to dodge questions when he meets with Mueller\u2019s team. Last week, Bannon infuriated lawmakers from both parties after he refused to answer questions before the House Intelligence Committee about his work during the presidential transition or in the West Wing. From his early days in the administration, Bannon was wary about the Russia investigation seeping into operations in the West Wing. He had only been working as chief strategist for a few months when he began trying to avoid meetings and discussions that could one day wind up of interest to investigators in the various Russia probes, according to sources familiar with the situation. But his efforts to shield himself fell short. Bannon was a key force in lobbying Trump to bring on attorney Marc Kasowitz and spokesman Mark Corallo as his first legal team that wrangled with Russia issues, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. But it took months for the administration to stand up its current structure of lawyers, both inside and outside the White House, to handle the daily deluge of Russia revelations. 5 things revealed about the Russia probe on Tuesday In the meantime, Bannon and other top administration officials \u2013 including former chief of staff Reince Priebus and current White House counsel Don McGahn \u2013 sometimes found themselves racing from the West Wing to the residence to huddle with the President about emerging developments in the Russia investigation. While Bannon may not have played a pivotal role in some of the key decisions that are raising alarms with investigators, even his knowledge of the President\u2019s mindset at the time could come into play. Bannon was largely cut out of the President\u2019s decision to fire Comey, a key element of Mueller\u2019s obstruction of justice investigation. Since leaving the White House, Bannon has publicly slammed the move, referring to it as the biggest mistake in modern political history in a September 2017 interview with CBS News\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d But Bannon could still provide insight into internal White House deliberations and Trump\u2019s state of mind as critical events like this unfolded. Even before his tenure in the White House, Bannon had been privy to a number of meetings and decisions that could be of interest to the special counsel and congressional investigators. The former Breitbart News executive\u2019s propensity for spouting off in colorful fashion appears to have raised investigators\u2019 interest in Bannon. Mueller\u2019s team could use Michael Wolff\u2019s book \u201cFire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House\u201d as a blueprint for their Bannon interview, in addition to whatever evidence the team has already gathered. \u201cThey will look for prior writings as well as statements by the witness, and they will be analyzed to determine whether they provide a basis for any line of questioning,\u201d said Michael Zeldin, a CNN contributor and a former prosecutor who was a special assistant to Mueller. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me if Mueller\u2019s team went through Michael Wolff\u2019s book and pulled out what they might want to ask about.\u201d In the book, Bannon said Trump \u201ckept trying\u201d to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin after the Kremlin strongman rebuffed Trump during his trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant in December 2013. Washington Post: Trump asked acting FBI director McCabe who he voted for in 2016 Bannon also claimed that Mueller\u2019s investigation is sure to lead back to money laundering. \u201cYou realize where this is going. \u2026 This is all about money laundering. Mueller chose (senior prosecutor Andrew) Weissmann first and he is a money-laundering guy,\u201d Bannon is quoted as saying in Wolff\u2019s book. \u201cTheir path to f***ing Trump goes right through Paul Manafort, Don Jr., and Jared Kushner. \u2026 It\u2019s as plain as a hair on your face.\u201d Bannon also said Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, both senior White House advisers, are \u201cterrified\u201d that Mueller will investigate the finances of their respective business empires. It\u2019s not important what Bannon thinks, Zeldin explained. What matters is whether Bannon can provide investigators with verifiable facts to support his claims. That\u2019s what Mueller will be looking for. Investigators are likely to press Bannon over the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr., Kushner and then-Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort. Exclusive: New signs Gates may be negotiating with Mueller's team Bannon is quoted disparaging Trump\u2019s son Trump Jr. and Kushner in \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d calling that meeting promising dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u201ctreasonous.\u201d Bannon has backtracked from that allegation and, after his House Intelligence Committee interview last week, sources told CNN that Bannon had acknowledged that the quote was \u201chyperbole.\u201d Bannon also claimed in the Wolff book that there was \u201czero\u201d chance that Trump Jr. didn\u2019t introduce the Russians to his father, an allegation Trump Jr. and others have denied. Bannon told the House Intelligence Committee that he had had conversations about the Trump Jr. meeting with the Russians with Priebus, Corallo and Sean Spicer, who was White House press secretary at the time, according to a report in Axios. \u201cBannon immediately realized he\u2019d slipped up and disclosed conversations he wasn\u2019t supposed to discuss, because they happened while he was chief strategist in the White House,\u201d the Axios report said. \u201cThe meeting \u2013 and the subsequent drafting of a misleading statement on Air Force One \u2013 has become one of the most important focal points of the Russia investigations, both on Capitol Hill and within Mueller\u2019s team, because it provides one of the clearest indications that the Trump campaign was willing to entertain collusion with Russians,\u201d the report said. Mueller\u2019s investigators may also have questions about Bannon\u2019s activities during the presidential transition, a period that lawmakers on Capitol Hill were interested in when Bannon made his first appearance before the House Intelligence Committee. Source: Trump inclined to allow Nunes memo to be released For instance, Bannon was forwarded an email during the transition detailing the plan for then-incoming national security adviser Flynn to talk with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions, according to The New York Times. The email is an important part of the investigation because it shows that Trump transition officials knew that Flynn would be discussing sanctions, despite later denials from Vice President Mike Pence and others. One of the other lingering questions in the Russia investigation is whether there was any collusion or cooperation between the Trump campaign\u2019s data team and the Russian government, which also used social media to target specific voters during the campaign. Both sides flatly deny any collusion. But Bannon is close to the Mercer family of GOP megadonors. They were major backers to Trump\u2019s campaign and support a variety of conservative groups, including Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked on the Trump campaign. Bannon served on the company\u2019s board before joining Trump\u2019s campaign. White House: Trump hasn't fired Mueller in part because of how the press would react Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix, who contacted WikiLeaks in June 2016 to ask about Clinton\u2019s emails, testified before the House Intelligence Committee in December. And Mueller asked for the company\u2019s emails last fall, according to the Wall Street Journal. Just three months after Nix contacted Wikileaks, it exchanged private messages on Twitter with Trump Jr. In most of the messages from late September 2016, which Trump Jr. later released to the public, WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to share its materials on social media. Trump Jr. sent an email about the conversation to Bannon and a group of other senior Trump campaign officials, according to The Atlantic, and Mueller could press for additional information on those exchanges.

After the meeting, Erik Prince \u2013 a businessman, Trump donor and Bannon ally \u2013 reached out to the prince and said he had authorization to act as an informal emissary for Trump, according to The Washington Post. CNN Poll: Nearly 8 in 10 say Trump ought to testify for Mueller if asked Prince, founder of the private security company Blackwater USA and the brother of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, flew to the Seychelles one month later and met Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive of the state-run Russian Direct Investment Fund, according to Prince\u2019s testimony at the House Intelligence Committee.

Sources: Mueller interested in questioning Trump on Comey, Flynn Papadopoulos\u2019 fianc\u00e9e, Simona Mangiante, told CNN that Papadopoulos communicated with Bannon and other high-ranking officials during the campaign and was more involved in the campaign\u2019s activities than the White House has acknowledged.

            "article_content": "Hope Hicks' appearance was anticipated given her close ties to President Donald Trump White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the White House was cooperating Hope Hicks\u2019 highly anticipated testimony before the House Intelligence Committee was abruptly delayed Thursday amid questions about whether the White House communications director would be able to respond to inquiries about topics after the campaign season, four sources told CNN. The surprise move came after Steve Bannon refused to answer scores of questions about topics during the transition and his time as President Donald Trump\u2019s chief strategist, with Bannon\u2019s attorney saying he had been instructed by the White House not to answer those questions over concerns that it could breach executive privilege. Hicks\u2019 appearance Friday was anticipated given her close ties to Trump, which predate the campaign, and the central role she has played through the election season and in the White House. Bannon given more time to sort out with WH what he can tell Hill investigators The committee made the decision to delay Hicks\u2019 appearance in order to give investigators time to sort out with the White House what she could and could not discuss, one of the sources said. She is still expected to speak with the panel at a later date. The White House and an attorney for Hicks did not respond to request for comment. On Wednesday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the White House was cooperating with the congressional investigations. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fully cooperative with the ongoing investigations, and we\u2019re going to continue to do so,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd we encourage the committees to work with us to find the appropriate accommodation in order to ensure Congress obtains all the information that they\u2019re looking for. But there\u2019s a process that this works through.\u201d But Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said the decision to scrap Hicks\u2019 testimony is part of a pattern to derail the probe. In addition to Bannon, he pointed to Wednesday\u2019s testimony of Corey Lewandowski, the former campaign manager who said he was unprepared to answer many questions about matters that occured after he left the campaign in 2016. He placed the blame on the cancellation of the testimony squarely on the White House. \u201cFollowing Mr. Lewandowski\u2019s testimony and refusal to answer questions, the administration canceled entirely an interview scheduled for Friday with another key witness in our investigation,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIf that interview has been rescheduled, the date has not yet been shared with the minority.\u201d",

            "article_content": "White House officials and the President Trump's personal lawyers have touted the administration's willingness to cooperate The scope of what Bannon was claiming was privileged shocked members from both parties The White House is working behind the scenes to limit the testimony to congressional investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, according to multiple sources. The attempts to curtail testimony to congressional investigators became clear this week when former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon appeared before the House Intelligence Committee and infuriated both sides of the aisle by refusing to answer questions about his work during the presidential transition and in the White House. At\u00a0some points during Bannon\u2019s six hours of closed-door testimony, his attorney took breaks to confer via telephone with the White House counsel\u2019s office to clarify what questions could be answered and came back with the same guidance: Bannon could not discuss any activities related to the transition or his tenure in the White House. \u201cAll shots were called by the White House,\u201d says one source familiar with the proceedings. Bannon will do interview with special counsel, avoiding grand jury for now Publicly, White House officials and President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyers have touted the administration\u2019s willingness to cooperate with the ongoing probes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fully cooperative with the ongoing investigations, and we\u2019re going to continue to do so,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters in Wednesday\u2019s press briefing. \u201cWe encourage the committees to work with us to find the appropriate accommodation in order to ensure Congress obtains all the information that they\u2019re looking for.\u201d But when it comes to the congressional investigations, the White House counsel\u2019s office is instructing some witnesses to limit their testimony, testing the extent of executive privilege by refusing to discuss any activity that occurred after the 2016 election. The White House claims that while Congress is entitled to ask any question it wants, privilege can be waived only by the President. They argue that, in this case, the transition is covered by privilege, while the campaign is not. WH directs Bannon to avoid answering Hill queries in Russia probe Democrats see it as an effort to muzzle important witnesses. \u201cThis was effectively a gag order by the White House preventing this witness from answering almost any question concerning his time in the transition or the administration. And then any questions even after he left the administration,\u201d said California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee. Bannon\u2019s team negotiated ground rules with the White House counsel\u2019s office the week prior to his appearance before the House Intelligence Committee, according to a source familiar with the situation. The President\u2019s personal legal team was aware of discussions between the White House counsel\u2019s office and Bannon\u2019s lawyer about protecting a possible privilege claim. But it wasn\u2019t their decision, according to a person familiar with the discussions. The protection of the privilege is a matter for the White House, not the President\u2019s legal team, because it relates to the office. Before the hearing, Bannon\u2019s lawyer informed a staff member of Rep. Devin Nunes, the California Republican who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, that Bannon planned to claim executive privilege on topics beyond the presidential campaign, a source said. Talks continue over potential Trump interview, but history suggests avoiding it is unlikely But that information was apparently tightly held. \u201cIt caught me personally by surprise\u201d that Bannon asserted executive privilege, said Rep. Mike Conaway, the Texas Republican leading the committee\u2019s Russia investigation. South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy and Florida Rep. Tom Rooney, the other two Republicans leading the Russia probe along with Conaway, also said they weren\u2019t aware of any agreement between the White House and committee staff about the scope of Bannon\u2019s testimony. Gowdy added that, if there were an agreement, he didn\u2019t think the staff would have told him anyway because he wouldn\u2019t have abided by it. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t do that because I\u2019d ask what I think is relevant to ask, and if you\u2019ve got a legal privilege you can assert it,\u201d Gowdy said, adding that Bannon was in a \u201clegally indefensible position.\u201d 3 more months of the Mueller investigation? Papadopoulos filing signals it's likely As it became clear on Tuesday that Bannon was refusing to answer questions, the committee served him with a subpoena to compel him to divulge additional information. The President\u2019s personal lawyers were not consulted on the specific questions that prompted calls to the White House, a source said. On Wednesday, the White House insisted such coordination between the White House counsel\u2019s office and congressional witnesses isn\u2019t unusual in a case like this. \u201cThat\u2019s the same process that is typically followed,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSometimes, they actually have a White House attorney present in the room. This time, it was something that was relayed via phone and, again, was following standard procedure for an instance like this, and something that will likely happen again on any other number of occasions, not just within this administration, but future administrations.\u201d But the scope of what Bannon was claiming was privileged shocked members from both parties. Mueller probe would continue during a government shutdown \u201cHis version of executive privilege is it covers the transition, the time he was at the White House and covers time forever,\u201d Gowdy told Fox News Wednesday. \u201cThat is no one\u2019s definition of executive privilege.\u201d \u201cI certainly have never heard of an example where executive privilege is claimed for a president-elect, I have never heard of privilege being claimed for conversations between two people that don\u2019t include the president, which were precluded from being asked about today,\u201d Rep. Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat and a member of the committee, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Tuesday. Lawmakers were also offended that Bannon had already divulged details about some of his post-campaign activities in Michael Wolff\u2019s explosive book \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d but then refused to discuss those events with the committee. Bannon\u2019s attorney also informed members that he would, in fact, answer those questions when he meets with special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team because executive privilege doesn\u2019t apply to Mueller\u2019s investigation. Talks continue over potential Trump interview, but history suggests avoiding it is unlikely Sanders declined to say Wednesday whether the White House has actually invoked executive privilege yet or is simply protecting its right to do so in the future. \u201cI can tell you that this White House is following the same practice that many White Houses before us have, that have gone back decades, that there is a process that you go through: Anytime you have congressional inquiries touching upon the White House, the Congress should consult with the White House prior to obtaining confidential material,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThis is part of a judicial-recognized process.\u201d When Attorney General Jeff Sessions appeared before the House Intelligence Committee, in order to preserve the right for Trump to invoke privilege, he refused to answer questions about whether Trump instructed him to hinder the Russia investigation. National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats both refused in a public Senate Intelligence Committee hearing to discuss private conversations with Trump and whether he tried to interfere with the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Manafort, Gates trial could come days before midterm election In December, Donald Trump Jr. refused to tell House investigators what he discussed with his father after reports surfaced about the June 2016 meeting Trump Jr. held with Russians in Trump Tower. In this instance, Trump\u2019s son cited attorney-client privilege because attorneys were present during the conversation with his father, pushing the issue even further into far murkier legal territory. Democrats charge that Bannon\u2019s appearance before the House committee marks the broadest attempt so far at using privilege to shield events that occurred from the moment Trump was elected. So far lawmakers have taken only limited steps to challenge witnesses about whether their claims of privilege are legitimate. Republicans haven\u2019t ruled out the possibility of holding Bannon in contempt, but at least one GOP member \u2013 Gowdy \u2013 suggested it was unlikely. House Speaker Paul Ryan downplayed the issue of whether witnesses like Bannon might be abusing the bounds of executive privilege. \u201cThere has always been a tension on executive privilege between the legislative branch and the executive branch. This goes back to every administration,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cObama exercised executive privilege, Bush did, Clinton did. That is a typical tension that you are going to have between the two branches of government.\u201d Still, Bannon\u2019s stonewalling sparked a sharp warning from Conaway \u2013 the Republican leading the House Russia probe \u2013 to White House aides who might follow the Bannon model: \u201cWe\u2019re going to insist on getting questions we need to answer our report.\u201d Bannon could appear before the House committee again on Thursday and \u201cwe fully anticipate\u201d he will answer questions, Conaway said. For its part, the White House offered a dismissive response to the ongoing Russia probes. \u201cI think we\u2019ve been dealing with this hoax for the better part of a year,\u201d Sanders said Wednesday. \u201cIf we have to endure the ridiculousness for another month, we can certainly handle it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) took to the Senate floor Wednesday to rebuke President Donald Trump for his repeated attacks on the media. Read Flake\u2019s speech as it was prepared for delivery: Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident \u2026\u201d So, from our very beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The founders were visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis of this ongoing idea of America. As the distinguished former member of this body, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, famously said: \u201cEveryone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.\u201d During the past year, I am alarmed to say that Senator Moynihan\u2019s proposition has likely been tested more severely than at any time in our history. Jeff Flake rips Trump: A president 'who cannot take criticism ... is charting a very dangerous path' It is for that reason that I rise today, to talk about the truth, and its relationship to democracy. For without truth, and a principled fidelity to truth and to shared facts, Mr. President, our democracy will not last. 2017 was a year which saw the truth \u2013 objective, empirical, evidence-based truth \u2013 more battered and abused than any other in the history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine \u201calternative facts\u201d into the American lexicon, as justification for what used to be known simply as good old-fashioned falsehoods. It was the year in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally-protected free press was launched by that same White House, an assault that is as unprecedented as it is unwarranted. \u201cThe enemy of the people,\u201d was what the president of the United States called the free press in 2017. Mr. President, it is a testament to the condition of our democracy that our own president uses words infamously spoken by Josef Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that so fraught with malice was the phrase \u201cenemy of the people,\u201d that even Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of \u201cannihilating such individuals\u201d who disagreed with the supreme leader. This alone should be a source of great shame for us in this body, especially for those of us in the president\u2019s party. For they are shameful, repulsive statements. And, of course, the president has it precisely backward \u2013 despotism is the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot\u2019s enemy, which makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power reflexively calls any press that doesn\u2019t suit him \u201cfake news,\u201d it is that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press. I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome responsibility to serve in this chamber knows that these reflexive slurs of \u201cfake news\u201d are dubious, at best. Those of us who travel overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas around the globe, encounter members of US based media who risk their lives, and sometimes lose their lives, reporting on the truth. To dismiss their work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their sacrifice. Flake: GOP should stand up to Trump's Stalin-like attacks on media According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80 journalists were killed in 2017, and a new report from the Committee to Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total includes 21 reporters who are being held on \u201cfalse news\u201d charges. Mr. President, so powerful is the presidency that the damage done by the sustained attack on the truth will not be confined to the president\u2019s time in office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful \u2013 in fact, we question the powerful most ardently \u2013 to do so is our birthright and a requirement of our citizenship \u2013 and so, we know well that no matter how powerful, no president will ever have dominion over objective reality. No politician will ever get to tell us what the truth is and is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or manipulate the truth to his own purposes should be made to realize the mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. And that is just as Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it. Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press is that the press usually corrects itself when it gets something wrong. Politicians don\u2019t. No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to these assaults on our institutions. And Mr. President, an American president who cannot take criticism \u2013 who must constantly deflect and distort and distract \u2013 who must find someone else to blame \u2013 is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as a check on the president adds to the danger. Now, we are told via Twitter that today the president intends to announce his choice for the \u201cmost corrupt and dishonest\u201d media awards. It beggars belief that an American president would engage in such a spectacle. But here we are. And so, 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple. And in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible. Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within us to turn back these attacks, right these wrongs, repair this damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further moral vandalism. Together, united in the purpose to do our jobs under the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us resolve to be allies of the truth \u2013 and not partners in its destruction. It is not my purpose here to inventory all of the official untruths of the past year. But a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are trivial \u2013 such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at last year\u2019s inaugural. But many untruths are not at all trivial \u2013 such as the seminal untruth of the president\u2019s political career - the oft-repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate \u2013 to the effort to undermine confidence in the federal courts, federal law enforcement, the intelligence community and the free press, to perhaps the most vexing untruth of all \u2013 the supposed \u201choax\u201d at the heart of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation. To be very clear, to call the Russia matter a \u201choax\u201d \u2013 as the president has many times \u2013 is a falsehood. We know that the attacks orchestrated by the Russian government during the election were real and constitute a grave threat to both American sovereignty and to our national security.  It is in the interest of every American to get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads. Ignoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward the United States leaves us vulnerable to further attacks. We are told by our intelligence agencies that those attacks are ongoing, yet it has recently been reported that there has not been a single cabinet-level meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America against these attacks. Not one. What might seem like a casual and routine untruth \u2013 so casual and routine that it has by now become the white noise of Washington - is in fact a serious lapse in the defense of our country. Mr. President, let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them. The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot be overstated. Mr. President, every word that a president utters projects American values around the world. The values of free expression and a reverence for the free press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps a people free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is the great leveler. And so, respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most important exports. But a recent report published in our free press should raise an alarm. Reading from the story: \u201cIn February\u2026Syrian President Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some 13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying, \u201cYou can forge anything these days, we are living in a fake news era.\u201d In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being \u201cdemonized\u201d by \u201cfake news.\u201d Last month, the report continues, with our President, quote \u201claughing by his side\u201d Duterte called reporters \u201cspies.\u201d In July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the Russian propaganda outlet, that the world media had \u201cspread lots of false versions, lots of lies\u201d about his country, adding, \u201cThis is what we call \u2018fake news\u2019 today, isn\u2019t it?\u201d There are more: \u201cA state official in Myanmar recently said, \u201cThere is no such thing as Rohingya. It is fake news,\u201d referring to the persecuted ethnic group. Leaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech, have promised \u201cfake news\u201d legislation in the new year.\u201d And on and on. This feedback loop is disgraceful, Mr. President. Not only has the past year seen an American president borrow despotic language to refer to the free press, but it seems he has in turn inspired dictators and authoritarians with his own language. This is reprehensible. We are not in a \u201cfake news\u201d era, as Bashar Assad says. We are, rather, in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself, to challenge free people and free societies, everywhere. In our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be cause for profound alarm, and spur to action. Add to that the by-now predictable habit of calling true things false, and false things true, and we have a recipe for disaster.  As George Orwell warned, \u201cThe further a society drifts from the truth, the more it will hate those who speak it.\u201d Any of us who have spent time in public life have endured news coverage we felt was jaded or unfair. But in our positions, to employ even idle threats to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put: it is the press\u2019s obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people\u2019s right to criticize their government. And it is our job to take it. What is the goal of laying siege to the truth? President John F. Kennedy, in a stirring speech on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, was eloquent in answer to that question: \u201cWe are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.\u201d Mr. President, the question of why the truth is now under such assault may well be for historians to determine. But for those who cherish American constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world \u2013 made all the more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily disassembling of our democratic institutions. We are a mature democracy \u2013 it is well past time that we stop excusing or ignoring \u2013 or worse, endorsing \u2013 these attacks on the truth. For if we compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost. I sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques, and as a young missionary in England he contemplated the question: \u201cWhat is truth?\u201d His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that I grew up with, titled \u201cOh Say, What is Truth.\u201d It ends as follows: \u201cThen say, what is truth? \u2018Tis the last and the first, For the limits of time it steps o\u2019er. Tho the heavens depart and the earth\u2019s fountains burst. Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst, Eternal\u2026 unchanged\u2026 evermore.\u201d Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Adam Schiff said Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes is blocking key witnesses Schiff's remarks underscore the political impasse in the House Russia investigation Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Thursday that Republicans are blocking dozens of witnesses from being interviewed in the Russia probe, including some who were aware of the 2016 Trump Tower meeting where Donald Trump Jr. was promised dirt on the Clinton campaign. In a briefing with reporters, Schiff accused Republicans of blocking the inquiry from moving ahead, leaving key questions unanswered. He said that the House Intelligence Committee has spoken to 56 witnesses, fewer than half of the number in the Senate Intelligence Committee. Among the witnesses he wants to interview: Ivanka Trump, plus he says the panel should consider issuing a subpoena to Trump Jr. for information he withheld during his classified hearing last year. \u201cWe can\u2019t do a thorough and credible investigation unless we obtain these documents \u2013 unless we talk to these witnesses,\u201d Schiff said. Schiff placed the blame largely on Republican Devin Nunes, saying the GOP chairman of the committee \u2013 who stepped aside from running the investigation for much of last year \u2013 has blocked dozens of requests for witnesses and subpoenas, with the support of House Speaker Paul Ryan. The White House declined to comment on Schiff\u2019s accusations. Aides to Nunes and GOP Rep. Mike Conaway, who is running the Russia probe, did not respond to requests for comment. An attorney for Trump Jr couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, and an Ivanka Trump attorney had no immediate comment. \u201cWhile Mr. Schiff tries to distract from the serious, bipartisan review that\u2019s been underway for nearly a year, we will stay focused on following the facts and working to safeguard the upcoming election,\u201d said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. The assessment from the committee\u2019s top Democrat underscores the partisan impasse that has plagued the House investigation, with Nunes and House Republicans now focusing on investigating allegations of improper FBI conduct during the 2016 elections and over its Russia probe \u2013 while Democrats demand a deeper dive into whether there was any Trump campaign collusion with the Russians. Among the questions Schiff says the probe has not answered: whether the former Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos \u2013 who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts over Russia \u2013 had communications with the Trump campaign about those efforts. Plus, Schiff says there has been scant interest in probing efforts by the late GOP operative Peter Smith, who sought the hacked Hillary Clinton emails during the election year. And Schiff says the committee needs to press Attorney General Jeff Sessions over key questions he did not answer, including whether the President took steps to hinder the Russia investigation. Moreover, Schiff said the GOP has blocked Democrats\u2019 demands to request documents and hold witness interviews about the misleading responses to the news media after the Trump Tower meeting was revealed last summer. And he says the GOP has not supported efforts to get information from the White House about the firing of former FBI director James Comey, saying the White House has ignored bipartisan requests while the GOP has done little to pursue it. Plus, he argued, the House panel needs to subpoena Deutsche Bank for the financial records of the Trump Organization to learn about any financial arrangements with Russian interests. \u201cThis investigation has gone about 1/4 of the time of the Benghazi investigations,\u201d Schiff said, referring to the GOP-led inquiries after the 2012 terrorist attacks in Benghazi, Libya. \u201cBut part of the reason why this investigation has taken longer than it should is because the majority has sat on our requests for witnesses for months and months and months.\u201d The GOP has agreed to bring in a handful of witnesses so far this year, including former senior Trump aide Steve Bannon, who is expected before the panel next week. But Schiff says that\u2019s not enough. Among the major topics still of interest to Schiff: the 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives that occurred after Trump Jr. was told he would get dirt on the Clinton campaign and that the Russian government wanted to see his father win the presidency. Even though the committee has interviewed nearly all the participants in the Trump Tower meeting, Schiff says there are additional witnesses \u201cwho knew the subject\u201d of the Trump Tower meeting that need to be interviewed. He declined to say whom these individuals were when asked. \u201cIt may be necessary for us to (release the names) in future if the majority does shut down the investigation or put it in some kind of hibernation,\u201d Schiff warned. \u201cThere are witnesses who have knowledge of the Trump Tower meeting and what it was about who have not been brought to our committee \u2013 and need to.\u201d Moreover, Schiff contended that Trump Jr. needs to provide more information after he declined to reveal to the panel the contents of a conversation he had with his father in 2016 after the Trump Tower meeting was initially revealed in The New York Times. Trump\u2019s son invoked attorney-client privilege, telling the House panel that he did not want to reveal the contents of their conversation because it was in presence of their lawyers, according to Schiff. Schiff says the GOP should agree to subpoena for that information if Trump Jr. does not provide details to the committee. \u201cWithout getting complete phone records .. we will not get a full picture of what conversations may have taken place between the president and his son contemporaneous with the Trump Tower meeting,\u201d Schiff said. Schiff said one of Trump\u2019s daughters \u2013 Ivanka \u2013 could provide valuable information to the investigation, but he said the GOP has yet to back efforts to request an interview with her. \u201cI think it would be valuable for her to testify and come before the committee,\u201d Schiff said. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Kara Scannell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump was surrounded by farmers and agriculture executives \"The American dream is roaring back to life,\" Trump said President Donald Trump used a Monday speech at the American Farm Bureau in Nashville to take a tax cut victory lap and sign two measures aimed at providing better rural broadband internet access. Trump, surrounded by a supportive audience of farmers and agriculture executives, cast himself as the first president in decades to focus on rural America and argued that the new tax law allows more farmers to keep money in their pockets and reinvest in their companies. \u201cIn every decision we make, we are honoring America\u2019s proud farming legacy,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYears of crushing taxes, crippling regulations and corrupt politics left our communities hurting, our economy stagnant and millions of hardworking Americans completely forgotten. But they, guess what, are not forgotten anymore.\u201d He added: \u201cThe American dream is roaring back to life,\u201d saying the bill provides \u201chistoric relief for our farmer and our middle class.\u201d Trump signed an executive order and a presidential memorandum that directed his administration to use \u201call viable tools to accelerate the deployment and adoption of affordable, reliable, modern high-speed broadband connectivity in rural America.\u201d \u201cI will sign two presidential orders to provide broader and faster and better internet coverage,\u201d Trump said before signing the measures. He then jokingly urged people to check out his oft-used Twitter account. \u201cMake sure you look up @realdonaldtrump,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a feeling you get that anyway, actually. It\u2019s our only way around the media.\u201d The orders followed input from farmers to Trump\u2019s rural America task force, who released a report on Monday that detailed their findings, including the need for better internet access. \u201cThat is why today in a few minutes I will take the first step to expand access to broadband internet in rural America so you can compete on a level playing field, which you were not able to do. Not fair,\u201d the President said. Improving rural broadband connectivity has long been a goal, and previous administrations \u2013 including President Barack Obama\u2019s \u2013 have tried to address the issue with little success. According to the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s 2016 Broadband Progress Report, 39% of rural Americans \u2013 roughly 23 million people \u2013 lack access to high-speed internet. Despite the boisterous welcome, the speech was also colored by Trump\u2019s push to renegotiate NAFTA and to leave other international trade agreements, policy proposals that many American farmers have not supported because of their reliance on international markets and low to no tariffs. Trump briefly mentioned renegotiating NAFTA during the speech \u2013 things are \u201cunder negotiation as we speak,\u201d he said \u2013 but moved on quickly, a tacit acknowledgment that the administration is aware many farmers are in favor of keeping NAFTA in place. Corker smooths over relationship with Trump, sources say Monday\u2019s victory lap comes after a consequential week for the President. Trump has been put on the defensive by revelations in \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d a new bombshell book by Michael Wolff, and spent much of the last week defending himself and looking to discredit the author. The President also met this weekend with top Republican lawmakers eager to chart the 2018 legislative calendar. Republicans, after passing tax reform at the end of 2017, want to hold on to their majorities in the House and the Senate, and Trump\u2019s speech will be a preview of how they will look to sell tax reform during an election year. Trump\u2019s remarks brought him face-to-face with many of the rural American voters who helped deliver him the White House in 2016. According to CNN\u2019s exit polls, 61% of rural voters backed Trump, compared with 34% who voted for Hillary Clinton. Trump, in a preview of possible 2018 messaging, slammed Democrats for voting against his tax plan and said that if they took power in the coming years they would look to raise Americans\u2019 taxes. He also said he had provided voters with the \u201cprivilege\u201d for voting for him in 2016. \u201cOh, are you happy you voted for me,\u201d he said. \u201cYou are so lucky that I gave you that privilege.\u201d Trump\u2019s remarks mimicked the Agriculture Department\u2019s report on the state of rural America. \u201cI think what we often see communicated about rural America is that there are these isolated pockets of despair that are beyond hope or recovery and that the population exodus from these areas will never be reversed and is just a part of where we are going,\u201d said Ray Starling, the President\u2019s special assistant for agriculture and agricultural trade. \u201cThe report makes clear that, at least this administration, that\u2019s not what we believe.\u201d Trump has been proud to tout his tax reform plan, which when it passed last month was his top legislative achievement of his first year in office. Sen. Bob Corker, a frequent Trump critic from the right, traveled to Tennessee aboard Air Force One on Monday. Sources familiar with discussions between Trump and Corker say the Tennessee senator has repaired his relationship with the commander in chief since the two men exchanged fierce words in the fall. Corker was seen smiling and interacting with Trump throughout the visit. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

View more opinion at CNN. Court filings on Friday regarding Paul Manafort and Michael Cohen reveal the ways in which the special counsel\u2019s investigation can endanger President Trump\u2019s future. Special Counsel Robert Mueller also revealed on Tuesday that former national security adviser Michael Flynn offered \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d to the Russia investigation \u2013 the same day Maryland and the District of Columbia issued subpoenas in their emoluments case against President Trump. Trump, concerned that the other shoe will finally drop when Mueller delivers his final report, unleashed a blitz of tweets early Friday attacking the investigation. Trump tried to discredit Mueller and tweeted, \u201cWe will be doing a major Counter Report to the Mueller Report. This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States!\u201d While the tweets are the words of an angry man, they also appear to be the words of a worried man. Amid the turmoil, Trump announced major personnel changes in his administration. The President said he will nominate State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert as UN ambassador and William Barr as attorney general. Meanwhile, Chief of Staff John Kelly is expected to step down soon. The cynic rightly responds to all of this week\u2019s news by asking \u2013 who cares? We have seen this kind of chaos before. Prosecutors: Michael Cohen acted at Trump's direction when he broke the law The theory is that partisanship will save this President. After all, Republicans will still control the Senate in 2019 with an even larger majority, so the likelihood of their support in any impeachment proceedings is slim. Republicans have stood by silently as the President ignores norms, threatens institutions, and conducts his erratic term in office. When it comes to taking a stand, congressional Republicans have done nothing to demonstrate that they privilege governance over partisanship. But do the past two years suggest President Trump is immune to the fallout that could result from the emoluments case or a damning Mueller report? In short, the answer is no. The same intense partisanship within the Republican Party that has protected President Trump until this point could just as easily turn against him. That is the essence of intense partisanship. Decisions are not about loyalty to an individual or principle but about power. When a person stands in the way of power, then they become disposable. Until the midterm elections, Republicans were feeling pretty good. They controlled the White House and the Congress, and with Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, the Supreme Court now leans considerably to the right as well. Republicans also amassed control of a huge number of state legislatures and governorships under President Obama. Combined with the political propaganda machine called Fox News, the party was feeling pretty good about themselves. Mueller is putting the puzzle pieces together on Trump Even if President Trump made members of the GOP cringe and went against certain political principles like free trade, it was still unclear how things would play out at the polls. While Republicans could not ignore the dismal approval ratings of the President, factors like redistricting, along with favorable Senate election prospects and voting restrictions, could have mitigated a blue wave. But that\u2019s not what happened. The midterm elections served a devastating blow to the GOP. Republicans lost the House and a significant number of state-level elections in the process. While Republicans in states like Wisconsin and Michigan are trying to limit the powers of incoming governors and other officials, Democrats will still have power. Democrats even showed that they are gaining strength in places like Arizona and Texas. Meanwhile, the stock market has plunged this week, undercutting the GOP\u2019s confidence in the policies of \u201cTariff Man,\u201d who until now had been enjoying the kind of economic rewards that kept skeptics quiet. What happens when Republicans learn what Robert Mueller has uncovered? What if the report produces clear and compelling evidence that the President and his associates committed high crimes and misdemeanors? What if the emoluments case shows that the President, through his hotel, has exchanged political decisions for bulk hotel reservations? What if the Congress learns that everything people suspected is just the tip of the iceberg? America may be too polarized to deal with impeachment The thing about scandals is that they can take on a life of their own. While Republicans have tried to stifle the investigation thus far, that can change once the facts are out there. The details will matter. If the findings are damaging enough, the report can leave a lasting impact by forcing Republicans to think twice about standing by the President through 2020. In many scandals \u2013 even Watergate \u2013 the party of the accused remained loyal to the alleged wrongdoer for a long time until the political costs become very clear. If the House moved forward and voted for articles of impeachment, the biggest question has to do with the Senate, where two-thirds of the chamber would have to vote in favor of removing a president. Will there be enough evidence to persuade 20 Republicans to join Democrats in favor of a conviction? Ironically, the other insurance policy that President Trump has been counting on \u2013 the very conservative Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 can turn into a liability. After all, if Republicans reach a tipping point in 2019 and determine that a scandal-ridden President can drag down the rest of the party, they might rally behind Pence for president, assured that he would stay loyal to the party agenda.  These are unsettling days for the Trump administration. The President is hoping that he can simply ignore what the investigators have to say or else just tweet them out of existence. But that\u2019s not how Washington works. It is a tough town and there are breaking points for any party when the costs of supporting a politician become unbearable. That\u2019s when the partisanship that the President has counted on could turn into his biggest problem.",

A record number of women won races in the midterm election, making the incoming Congress the most female and the most racially diverse in American history. So of course presidential speculation is all about the white guy who lost his Senate race.  And indeed on Monday in El Paso, Beto O\u2019Rourke acknowledged that he\u2019s considering running for president in 2020. Don\u2019t get me wrong, Beto O\u2019Rourke is an inspiring politician, and on a visceral level, I understand Beto-mania. He\u2019s a mostly progressive politician who nearly won a US Senate seat in Texas, which is no small feat. He\u2019s approachably good looking. He\u2019s personable and engaging, drawing in fans with his social media livestreams \u2013 Beto in a minivan! Beto on a run! \u2013 and his sincere interactions with voters on tough topics. His defense of NFL players protesting racism by kneeling during the national anthem, which he made in response to a question from a voter who found that kneeling disrespectful, went viral for good reason: Here\u2019s a politician who, even in the face of a displeased potential constituent, stuck to his guns and engaged a red-hot issue with respect but not blind deference. He has a backbone. He also speaks in a similar pitch and cadence as Barack Obama and has a similar lanky, slightly goofy handsomeness to him. For those of us who hear Obama speak now and feel a tug of wistfulness \u2013 hoping we might again have a president so sincere, so eloquent, so deeply intelligent \u2013 Beto feels familiar. Should Dems bet on Beto? He brings us back to that comfortable time when politics was optimistic. When we were competent. When America seemed to again represent the best of what was possible. But that ability to feel familiarly inspiring is itself a privilege reserved for men. After all, we still have never had a female president of the United States. While Hillary Clinton motivated many, Americans have yet to experience the familiarity of a female president. There\u2019s no mold, then, for bright, charismatic female candidates to fit into, no space for them to gain an advantage via \u201cshe reminds me of\u2026\u201d. We still understand executive power as male, and so we continue to look to men to occupy it. Perhaps we aren\u2019t looking to the newly elected class of House women, which includes \u2013 mark my words \u2013 future party superstars like Ayanna Pressley, because they\u2019re fairly green. Fair enough \u2013 experience and a long dedication to public service should matter (even if it didn\u2019t with the current President). But it\u2019s not as if there aren\u2019t women with significant experience in the field of potential presidential candidates. Stacey Abrams also lost a tough race in a red state, but made incredible progress and rightly excited a lot of Georgia voters. Kyrsten Sinema pulled out a squeaker for her Arizona Senate seat, although as a conservative Democrat, she may not be the best national fit. O'Rourke congratulates Cruz on his victory And of course there are superstar women who are already in the Senate, including Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren, who bring experience, expertise and varying degrees of charisma. We\u2019re talking about all three of them, sure. But there\u2019s no \u201cmania.\u201d That seems to be reserved for the guys. Perhaps this is because only men are charismatic or exciting? That seems doubtful: Those characteristics have not been distributed to only half the population. Or maybe it\u2019s because women are held to entirely different and often impossible-to-meet standards. We know that in professional settings, men are promoted and rewarded based on their perceived potential, whereas women have to prove their competence and perform well to be given opportunities. We see that same dynamic at work here: In this distorted calculation, even the most high-achieving women in Congress haven\u2019t adequately proven that they\u2019re good enough for the job, or they\u2019ve made minor missteps that are magnified and twisted into looking like disqualifying errors. Gillibrand said Al Franken should resign, so she\u2019s apparently become persona non grata. She was also pro-gun as an upstate congresswoman, although this same demerit does not apply to Bernie Sanders, just because. O'Rourke, Cruz pose together for photo Kamala Harris was a prosecutor, which makes her a kind of two-faced Dr. Jekyll / Mr. Hyde progressive / conservative. Elizabeth Warren has, we\u2019re told, an allegedly grating voice, is too much of a national figure (something that tends to help men), and responded to the President\u2019s accusations of lying about her Native American heritage in a way that some on the left found imperfect. Cast them out!  Beto, though \u2013 he has potential. Never mind that O\u2019Rourke, inspiring as he is, is in fact a fairly moderate Democrat \u2013 more conservative in relation to his party than Gillibrand, Harris and Warren. That isn\u2019t disqualifying, but it complicates the (false) narrative of O\u2019Rourke as a true progressive hero in the face of more moderate women. None of this is meant as a slam on O\u2019Rourke, who I think is great. But it is a nudge to examine the assumptions and biases that give us Beto-mania while conveniently ignoring or actively kneecapping the great many competent, talented, progressive women who could be just as exciting \u2013 if only we let go of our deepest biases, embraced the possibility of female power, and let ourselves get excited.",

View more opinion at CNN. Will millennials vote on Tuesday? For anyone who has reached for the Lunesta in the anxious run up to November 6, it\u2019s a question that hangs with almost unbearable gravity. Will young people overcome their (alleged) disaffection to exercise the most essential American privilege? Will they put their broad minds and shoulders to the wheel? Will they please please save us from the Apocalypse? As a sleepless citizen, I\u2019ve had lots of time to worry about this. And, with the last of my optimism, to count on them. But, then, I cannot actually imagine sitting the election out. Because I\u2019m a voting freak. My first time in a voting booth, I was 6 years old. At our town hall, I fiddled around by the front door while my mother exchanged pleasantries with Mrs. Hurlbut, the town clerk. It was 1972 and only about 1,200 people lived in Roxbury, Connecticut. One booth \u2013 part pinball machine, part shower stall \u2013 waited for customers across the small room. While my mother signed in, I wandered away to look out the window. When I turned around, she was gone. Catching sight of her familiar ankles beneath the closed curtains of the machine, I scurried past Mrs. Hurlbut and through the flaps. With my mother\u2019s free hand in mine, I watched while she worked the mysterious contraption. Twelve years later, I came home from college to cast my first vote for president. Mrs. Hurlbut remained functioning beneath a corona of white hair, but the machine that year was broken. On a paper ballot, I filled in the bubble beside the names of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro, and walked out puffed with pride at my role as a grown-up American citizen, pride that survived their defeat. By 1988, I\u2019d become a fully engaged political animal. Fresh from graduation and living in New York, I volunteered for Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis\u2019 primary campaign. Then I stayed on through the general election. The experience was exhausting and exhilarating. I loved being part of something important, though I was often stunned by the trust invested in me. It's not the 'Year of the Woman.' It's the 'Year of the Women' In Ohio, I was a surrogate scheduler, planning stops for VIPs who came to campaign for the candidate.  One day, for a heart-stopping hour, I lost the president of the Boston Bricklayers Union. While the field operator seethed at a packed VFW hall outside Columbus, I sweated it out, a phone on each ear, before hearing from the designated driver, a kid no older than me. He and Mr. McIntyre had gotten lost and were taking a break at a diner. I could have offered them my head. On a platter. I was young, and in the Iran Contra \u201980s, aggrieved by both the system and the old folks who created it. But instead of skepticism, I coursed with idealism, and an almost stupid sense of commitment. In the months when Dukakis was running ahead of George H.W. Bush, I thrived on junk food and adrenaline-charged optimism. As the polls tightened, I fretted and doubled down on my duties. And when things looked dire, I carried on, a soldier devoted to the mission and the man. By Election Day, the outcome of the race was painfully obvious. New York would go blue, as usual, but in most of the country the tide had turned definitively red. I woke on November 8 and headed up to East Harlem to knock on doors. After that, I planned to go to Boston to be present for the inevitable concession cry-fest. But in between I had to vote. It was around 3 in the afternoon when I made it to my polling place. During the last hours of campaigning, a co-worker had slapped a Dukakis bumper sticker on the back of my sweatshirt. As I ran up the stairs inside PS 87, I suddenly remembered the sticker was there and stopped to peel it off. I didn\u2019t want to be accused of electioneering. I didn\u2019t want anything to disqualify me from casting my second, and personally most significant, presidential vote. The disappointment I felt about my candidate\u2019s impending loss was riding a totally different track than the zeal I had for the democratic process. A familiar spark of civic spirit fired in my chest. Inside the gym, I found a scene nothing like I knew from Roxbury. So many tables! So many machines! Not wanting to appear untutored, I pulled out my voting card and puzzled my way to the appropriate table. Two women \u2013 pleasant, indifferent \u2013 matched my name on the card to the one in the polling book. I work for one of the candidates, I wanted to say, signing my name with a flourish. I wasn\u2019t just some amateur off the street. I was a professional! Praying for peace at 16: It will be 2 years till I'm heard at the ballot box But still, I\u2019d never actually operated a voting machine. Stepping between the curtains, I eyed the red handle.  A couple summers earlier, my friend Laura and I had taken a trip out West. Somewhere in Nevada we passed an evening at a run-down casino drinking free liquor and feeding quarters to the slot machines. Inside the voting booth, I grabbed the handle and worked it like a one-armed bandit. With a pull to the right, the curtain closed around me. Pulling left, the space opened up again. As soon as I\u2019d done it, I knew it was a mistake. When I tried to move the levers to vote for individual candidates, they wouldn\u2019t turn. \u201cExcuse me,\u201d I said approaching the ladies at the table. \u201cI pulled the lever thingie but I haven\u2019t voted yet.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d one of the them replied, dry as toast. \u201cI pulled the curtain closed but then I pulled it open again before I voted. I need to do it again.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d she said. Trying to contain my alarm, I asked for clarification. \u201cYou\u2019re done,\u201d she answered flatly. \u201cYou can\u2019t vote again.\u201d  Even now, I don\u2019t fully understand my behavior that afternoon. One of the most common tropes about millennial nonvoters is a sense of deficiency. They don\u2019t think their votes matter, so they don\u2019t vote. Here I was backing a candidate certain to win by a healthy margin in my state, and just as certain to lose nationwide. My vote literally did not matter. Which did not slow me down a whit. If I were hitching a ride out of Zombieland, I could not have been more panicked or adamant. \u201cI have to vote,\u201d I told the ladies. \u201cYou have. You\u2019re done,\u201d they insisted. Poll workers from other precincts were drawn over by the debate, but each concurred with the existing verdict. I\u2019d pulled the handle back. My vote, empty as it was, had been cast. I couldn\u2019t vote again. Where was Mrs. Hurlbut when I needed her? Finally, one kindly worker, moved by my mania, left to consult with a supervisor. Returning, she handed me a piece of paper with a number. \u201cCall the Board of Elections,\u201d she said, looking warmly into my eyes. Following her directions, I raced upstairs to a pay phone. Not surprisingly on Election Day, the number was busy. For 15 minutes I fed my quarter into the phone and fruitlessly pressed the same buttons. The clock was ticking on my Boston trip.  It was time to consider another plan. I left PS 87 and ran the four blocks to my apartment. At home I had a phone with a long cord and a redial button. By the time I got through to the Board of Elections, I\u2019d packed my bag and was positioned by the door. \u201cYes, Miss, I understand,\u201d said the woman on the other end of the receiver, \u201cbut the only thing you can do is go before a judge.\u201d Trump is trying to whip up fear about the browning of America Where, I wanted to know, was that judge? Moments later, I was on the 1 train to 200 Varick Street and the headquarters of the New York County Board of Elections. Even I thought I was bananas. But like the train itself, once I\u2019d set the thing in motion it was just too late to stop. Penn Jillette's audacious wish My motives that day were fairly simple, and not particularly patriotic. By my lights, it seemed fraudulent to have spent so much time exhorting people to vote and then not managing to vote myself. What sort of pinhead doesn\u2019t know how to operate a voting machine? What would I tell my parents? What would I tell my friends? But under the thicket of guilt and self-recrimination, I\u2019d glimpsed something of true adulthood. It wasn\u2019t a game played for quarters. And you didn\u2019t walk away when the trend was not in your favor.  The aim was to be counted, for oneself. But the meaning and the deeper pleasure came from being counted on, by others. At Varick Street, I raised my right hand and stepped to the bench. As I told my story to the elderly judge, he shook his head and a smile slowly creased his face. When I busted back into PS 87 with my overnight bag in one hand and the judge\u2019s decision in the other, the poll workers applauded. I cast my vote and headed north, my freak flag flying high.",

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Michael Cohen\u2019s attorney, Lanny Davis, announced this month that his client had recently registered as a Democrat. But everyone knows what Michael Cohen really is. He is a lawyer \u2013 and a rat. And as a lawyer-rat he is a particularly loathsome member of the order Rodentia. This is because clients confide their most intimate secrets to lawyers thinking they are protected by the attorney-client privilege. When their trusted lawyer reveals his true identity as a member of the rat family who has peddled their secrets to save his own rodent skin, like Cohen did to President Donald Trump, their sense of betrayal is grave to say the least. Such conduct will soon cause the rat to discover he now has only two categories of friends \u2013 exterminators and prosecutors. In both cases their affection for the hated rodent may be warranted. Prosecutors sometimes achieve courtroom success by relying on the testimony of rats. Special counsel Robert Mueller is always seeking their cooperation and offering them tasty \u201ccooperation deals\u201d for their information and testimony. Cohen has been scurrying between Mueller\u2019s office and the offices of New York state and federal prosecutors in compliance with a plea deal recently negotiated by New York federal prosecutors. Cohen, in an unusual display of sound judgment, has wisely elected to team up with the prosecutors rather than the exterminators. He hopes to achieve not only a more lenient sentence but also some element of redemption by assisting federal prosecutors and acting as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d of sorts. While turncoats often spend less time in jail, they rarely get their reputations back, regardless of the value of their information. \u201cSammy the Bull\u201d is still viewed as a mobster, and Cohen lacks the gravitas of John Dean, the former Nixon White House counsel who cooperated with prosecutors in the Watergate scandal and became the poster child of turncoat redemption. As a rat, Cohen executed an unorthodox move. He announced, through his attorney, his decision to affiliate with the Democratic Party. We rarely associate rats with exercising the constitutional right to affiliate with a political party and vote because some are felons who are prohibited by law from voting. In fact, Democrats, without even thinking about Cohen or any other soon-to-be Republican convicted felons, are pressing nationwide for laws restoring voting rights to some convicted felons. Since Cohen has yet to be sentenced, he is, at least technically, not yet a convicted felon. But he is officially a registered Democrat. Mueller's investigation is far from finished In truth, the Republicans and Democrats may differ on a lot of things, but like most people, they too hate rats and \u201cbagmen.\u201d The Republicans, though, must have had a good laugh Friday as Cohen proffered political advice to fellow Democrats on CNN. Cohen said, \u201cListen, here\u2019s my recommendation. Grab your family, grab your friends, grab your neighbors, and get to the poll, because if not, you are going to have another two or another six years of this craziness. \u2026 So make sure you vote. All right?\u201d The only way that Trump\u2019s \u201ccraziness\u201d can truly be eliminated through the election of more Democrats to Congress is if they vote to impeach the President. One interpretation of Cohen\u2019s remarks, therefore, is as a recommendation of impeachment in his new role as political adviser to his fellow Democrats. Michael Cohen: Vote, or face more years of 'craziness' Unfortunately, just like much of Cohen\u2019s legal advice, this political advice is deeply flawed. If sufficient Democrats are elected to impeach Trump, the whole impeachment process will prolong rather than shorten the \u201ccraziness.\u201d The impeachment of the President would then be followed by a circus trial in the Senate. A conviction there would require the assent of two-thirds of the elected senators. Even if, through some miracle, the Democrats achieve a senatorial majority in the November midterms, no reliable political analysts are predicting they will achieve the two-thirds majority required for a Trump conviction on impeachment charges. There may be a lot of good reasons to elect Democrats to Congress, but doing so to impeach Trump and eliminate the \u201ccraziness\u201d is not one of them. Smears of Robert Mueller are baseless Cohen is demonstrating why prosecutors really hate being put in a position where they must rely on the testimony of a \u201crat.\u201d Prosecutors often tell jurors that the rats, turncoats and informants who are testifying for a \u201cdeal\u201d are necessary to protect society and bring the bad guys, especially those wealthy \u201cwhite collar criminals,\u201d to justice. What prosecutors rarely tell jurors is that sometimes such testimony is counterproductive, resulting in an acquittal for the bad guy on trial and freedom for the immunized rat who escapes a just punishment for his own despicable acts. In the end, if a prosecutor makes a deal with a rat to get a rat, it should be only for desperately needed evidence not obtainable from other sources. Sometimes it is in the interest of society that this be done. It is highly unlikely that Cohen\u2019s case meets the societal interest test.  Cohen\u2019s computers and relevant emails have already been seized pursuant to a search warrant. The information was pre-screened by a highly respected former federal judge, Barbara Jones, who served as a court-appointed special master. It was then copiously examined by top federal prosecutors from the Southern District of New York upon referral from Mueller. Under the circumstances, it is highly unlikely that Cohen is serving up anything new and unobtainable elsewhere that would induce Mueller to make a deal with him. Poor Cohen. What could be worse than auditioning for the position of \u201crat\u201d and being rejected for the part? At least he is now a registered Democrat, and who knows what the future holds? Stormy Daniels may need a new lawyer when Michael Avenatti hits the campaign trail.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. Since the explosion of #MeToo in October 2017, many of us have become jaded to the stock responses we can often expect from certain figures to stories of sexual harassment and abuse. At a rally in Pennsylvania last week, for example, President Trump once again mocked the movement, claiming he \u201cwasn\u2019t allowed\u201d to use certain expressions anymore, and laughing when a member of the crowd urged him to \u201cdo it anyway.\u201d It is galling in another way, however, to hear #MeToo undermined from an unexpected quarter \u2013 as it was a few days ago by Trump\u2019s 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton. The former first lady, senator and secretary of state was asked during a CBS interview that aired on Sunday whether she felt that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, abused his power by having an affair with Monica Lewinsky while he was in office. Her response? Lewinsky \u201cwas an adult\u201d when it happened. When asked whether her husband should have stepped down after the scandal and his resulting impeachment, she replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d Clinton followed her answer with a question: \u201cBut let me ask you this. Where\u2019s the investigation of the current incumbent, against whom numerous allegations have been made, and which he dismisses, denies, and ridicules?\u201d Trump's mockery emboldens rape culture Monica Lewinsky was a 24-year-old White House intern at the time of her affair with President Clinton. He was 51. There are vital differences between behavior that constitutes sexual assault and actions that are abuses of power, of which having an affair with an intern many leagues your junior when you are the most powerful man in the world is obviously one. But both merit examination. Clinton\u2019s protestation that Lewinsky was \u201can adult\u201d undermines a core lesson of #MeToo: that abuse isn\u2019t necessarily contingent on age, gender, or fame, but is always contingent on power. Her resorting to \u201cwhataboutery\u201d made it impossible to have a nuanced discussion about the particular abuse of privilege her husband was guilty of, and that many people who look up to her would have found relatable. It also squandered an opportunity to showcase an alternative mode of leadership, which considering her 2016 defeat and that year\u2019s victor, seems an especially unfortunate waste. Clinton\u2019s call for an investigation of course referred to President Trump, and the numerous accusations of harassment and sexual assault that have been leveled at him since their race for office in 2016.  Trump, too, has been in the press over the last few days commenting on similar themes, including at his infamous Mississippi rally earlier this month. How myths about sexual harassment keep us in the dark Addressing the local crowd, he mocked professor Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony describing an alleged sexual assault at the hands of then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh (which he denied). Kavanaugh has since been sworn in. During his own interview with CBS, which also aired on Sunday, Trump doubled down on his offensive impression of Blasey Ford, declaring: \u201cHad I not made that speech, we would not have won.\u201d Trump\u2019s behavior is revolting, and must not be diminished in the context of substandard rhetoric from his former rival. But Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to provide a superior example is disappointing for everyone who is still rooting for women to claim their power. Her defense of her husband\u2019s actions in retrospect \u2013 and even after #MeToo \u2013 sounds like what one might expect of a former first lady, not of a political contender in her own right. Her decision to back her husband over Lewinsky rang similar to Trump\u2019s wife Melania, who recently stressed that victims of sexual assault need to show \u201creally hard evidence.\u201d Melania Trump's destructive message to sex crime victims Tellingly, Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, who holds Hillary Clinton\u2019s former seat in New York, said last year that stepping down would have been \u201can entirely appropriate response\u201d for President Clinton after the Lewinsky scandal. She added: \u201cWe should have a very different conversation about President Trump, and a very different conversation about allegations against him.\u201d There must be few people on whom missed opportunities weigh more heavily than Hillary Clinton. In losing the presidential race she rewrote the first line of her obituary and sealed herself in the public consciousness as the woman who fell (or was pushed) at the final hurdle \u2013 emblematic of the past, rather than a figurehead for change. It feels strange, when she must be so sensitive to the public mood and likely response, to watch her repeat what feel like stale mistakes. After she lost the presidential race in 2016, she said: \u201cTo all the little girls watching \u2026 never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.\u201d Her CBS interview suggested uncomfortable exceptions to that rule, when the right man\u2019s narrative is threatened. Meanwhile, Trump continues to make a direct mockery of women\u2019s pain, and glibly brushes off accusations against himself. In different ways, both negate the most significant social movement of the last two years.  The midterm elections are weeks away. It will be the first time voters can weigh in on a national level about the impact of the 2016 election, and everything since. It is clear that any positive development will depend on fresh blood at the helm for both parties. If anything is to be learned from Trump\u2019s election, it is that America is receptive to, and hungry for, change. If anything is to be learned from Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat, it is that there is no point in defending a tired status quo, which defends inherited privilege. It seems she is yet to fully appreciate that lesson. Let us hope that Democrats at large have, and that they will secure a more forward-thinking candidate for their 2020 challenge.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. The only thing more potentially devastating to our country than Brett Kavanaugh being railroaded onto the Supreme Court would be if, while the spotlight is on Sens. Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake, a Democrat enables the decisive vote. We\u2019ve seen this movie before, where Democrats fumbled a chance to restore moral prestige to a damaged institution by blocking a nominee with extreme baggage: Last May, they clinched the confirmation of Gina Haspel as director of the CIA, putting a face many associate with exported American torture on an agency with decades of blood and sin to atone for, including the George W. Bush \u201cenhanced interrogation\u201d era in which Haspel thrived. (Haspel, who faced criticism during her confirmation hearings for her role as head of a \u201cblack site\u201d in Thailand, gained Democratic Sen. Mark Warner\u2019s support with written assurance that she would as director \u201crefuse to undertake any proposed activity that is contrary to my moral and ethical values\u201d \u2013 though she declined to say whether torture was immoral.) In addition to the three Republican fence-sitters, there has been a possibility that one or two Democrats waging tough re-election battles in Trump-loving states \u2013 Heidi Heitkamp (North Dakota) and Joe Manchin (West Virginia) \u2013 will cast a prophylactic \u201cyea.\u201d On Thursday, Heitkamp announced she would vote no. But any Democratic complicity in elevating Kavanaugh will mean that the cancer on this presidency, already in stage \u201cwhat did he know and when did he know it,\u201d has metastasized to the opposition. And with the nation\u2019s highest court poisoned in the process, the threat of collapse for the body politic would only grow. Feinstein: FBI probe was incomplete Donald Trump recently called the Democrats \u201cthis horrible, horrible, radical group,\u201d which is \u201cdetermined to take back power by any means necessary,\u201d while campaigning against Manchin in Wheeling, West Virginia. That was where Sen. Joe McCarthy launched his own lie-based assault on civic norms in February 1950 by brandishing \u201chere in my hand a list of 205\u201d Communist traitors in the State Department. Manchin initially seemed perfectly willing to vote for Kavanaugh \u2013 and as of this writing is still undecided. And so he finds himself the unlikely \u201cconscience of the Senate,\u201d a title once bestowed on Alabama Democratic Sen. Howell Heflin. That ur-Blue Dog cast a critical judiciary committee vote in 1987 to deny a Supreme Court seat to Robert Bork. The other politically bold vote of conscience highlighted in his New York Times obituary was against a court seat for Clarence Thomas. Will Manchin follow the example of the conservative Democrats who allowed Thomas to martyr and arguably perjure his way on to the Court? Or will he say: We cannot abdicate to Realpolitik when democracy is on the brink? This question changed the face of the Supreme Court The Democrats could have established cover for Manchin and Heitkamp well before Christine Blasey Ford stepped up with her sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh. Once the Republicans withheld some 100,000 pages of relevant Kavanaugh documents under unprecedentedly broad claims of executive privilege, the Democrats should have mustered an opposition based solely on the integrity of the confirmation process. Yet not even the Democrats\u2019 2016 vice-presidential standard-bearer, Tim Kaine of Virginia, found the words to say: If I am asked to confirm a nominee whose knowable record has not been disclosed, my default answer is no. Instead of a face-off between Team Ford and Team Kavanaugh, the real conflict was already evident \u2013 one between Team Process and Team Abuse of Process. But now the Republicans could use any shadow of a \u201che said, she said\u201d doubt to retroactively white-out the numerous other deceits Kavanaugh has advanced under oath dating back to confirmation hearings in 2004 about his role as a Bush political operative promoting judgeships with the help of stolen emails and discussing torture and surveillance policies. What exactly is Jeff Flake looking for? This favorite fact-bending ploy of Republicans is a cousin of the Big Lie strategy reflected in Kavanaugh\u2019s overdetermined denials, with their easily disprovable garnishes of arrogance (such as: \u201cShe and I did not travel in the same social circles\u201d). The Minor Inconsistency is likewise deployed to \u201crefute\u201d (in Kavanaugh\u2019s specious sense of the word) a fundamental truth. Thus,  the serial untruths (notably about the timing of his awareness of the Debbie Ramirez sexual misconduct allegations) that might have added up to a process-based perjury offense for the Democrats \u2013 \u201cHow much mendacity is too much for Republicans to accept in a Supreme Court justice?\u201d\u2013 is batted into a rim shot by the Republicans\u2019 insistence on trial-level corroboration of a sexual assault charge. Republican double standards have been throwing Democrats off balance since at least the days of Joe McCarthy, who forms a devil\u2019s triangle with Trump via their mutual fixer, Roy Cohn. A New York Times review of William F. Buckley Jr.\u2019s 1954 celebration of the Communist-hunting senator, \u201cMcCarthy and His Enemies,\u201d pointed out, \u201cMistakes, in this book, are not tolerable when made by non-McCarthyites. When made by McCarthyites, however, and especially by Mr. McCarthy himself, they call only for a gentle chiding.\u201d And so Team Kavanaugh\u2019s extraordinarily reckless mistaken-identity scenario \u2013 burnished by the PR firm that Swiftboated presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004 \u2013 becomes a mere \u201coops\u201d once the theory has been conveniently injected into the Fox bloodstream. Gergen: McConnell cares about getting it done Meanwhile, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee eschewed the energy of insurgency mounting outside the chamber against Republican zeal to plow right through \u2013 steering clear of the anonymous accusers and a witness produced by lawyer Michael Avenatti, the rare streetfighter on the Democratic squad. But the Republicans, who have parlayed \u201cno sense of decency\u201d into vile political theater, will undoubtedly recycle those \u201cWe Believe All Survivors\u201d signs carried by Team Ford as payback against Democratic nominees for the \u201cfalse accusations\u201d against their guy. Or in the prophecy of Kavanaugh himself, \u201cWhat goes around comes around.\u201d The Democrats refrained from pointing out the karmic irony of Bill Clinton\u2019s pornographic Boswell being forced to answer questions about what the meaning of the word \u201cboofing\u201d is.  If no Republicans defect from Kavanaugh, it would be nice if the Democrats denied them the fig leaf of \u201cbipartisanship\u201d and mounted a unanimous dissent, something to make their grandchildren, their party and maybe one day even their country proud. They must realize we cannot normalize lying in a legal system whose very authority depends on the presumption of truth telling. The reward of being on the right side of history is the reason we know the name of Justice John Marshall Harlan, the lone dissenter in Plessy v. Ferguson, but not the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d majority opinion author (Henry Billings Brown, Yale 1856; I Googled). And that\u2019s why Atticus Finch, who did his righteous duty in the face of futility, is the most respected lawyer in America. A few months before her death in early 2016, Harper Lee knowingly destroyed her great American hero from \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d by releasing a long-ago-rejected first novel in which Atticus is the champion of white segregationist privilege. Perhaps she foresaw the swamp into which the rest of our national myths would sink come Election Day. This article has been updated to reflect Heidi Heitkamp\u2019s Thursday statement.",

Kira Sanbonmatsu and Susan J. Carroll are professors of political science at Rutgers University-New Brunswick and senior scholars at CAWP.  They are the authors of \u201cA Seat at the Table: Congresswomen\u2019s Perspectives on Why Their Presence Matters\u201d (Oxford University Press 2018). The views expressed here are solely those of the authors. View more opinion articles on CNN. In 1991, Anita Hill testified in front of an all-white, all-male Senate Judiciary Committee about her allegations that she was sexually harassed by then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas (accusations that he denied). Nearly three decades later, another woman may sit in front of the same committee \u2013 though its makeup has changed overall, its members from the majority party are still all men \u2013 to share her own story of attempted rape by the man, who has also denied it, currently awaiting confirmation to the Supreme Court. Do the differences between 1991\u2019s Judiciary Committee and today\u2019s, especially when it comes to gender, matter? In our new book, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, makes a case for why it does. \u201cI think it is easier for a female member to imagine what it\u2019s like to be victimized, to be disbelieved, disregarded, and retaliated against,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is something that they can imagine happening easier than many of our male colleagues who can\u2019t imagine ever being victimized or disbelieved or disregarded because they\u2019ve never experienced that.\u201d \u201cI think there is a fundamental difference between our world experiences that will allow us to empathize differently,\u201d she added. She heckled Trump, then won primary election In an election year in which record numbers of women are on the ballot, speaking with women officeholders provides some insights into the difference it might make if more women win so that they are at the tables \u2013 and on the committees \u2013 where major political decisions are being made. Whether by changing the conversation, or transforming the culture and image of Congress, women\u2019s presence in Congress matters. In her interview with us, Representative Donna Edwards, D-Maryland, said \u201cthere\u2019s just not enough of us, period.\u201d 2018 might change that, and the congresswomen we interviewed make the case for why that\u2019s a good thing. Drawn from interviews with 83 congresswomen, the findings in our book point to at least five ways in which women\u2019s representation has made a difference in recent congresses. Congresswomen shape the policy agenda to include overlooked and underaddressed issues. Seated in a House Ways and Means Committee debate, Representative Linda S\u00e1nchez, D-California, provided a reality check to her male colleagues about the pressing challenges of finding affordable childcare. In her words, the distinct truth of women\u2019s lives \u201cnever even crosses (men\u2019s) mind(s).\u201d \u201cI feel like my role as a woman on the committee is very important,\u201d she told us, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t just speak for myself, I speak for many similarly situated women. \u2026 (Were I) not there, that perspective (would be) totally absent from the debate.\u201d As millennial women lean left, this GOP candidate took a stand for the right When Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Massachusetts, introduced the 2015 Prioritizing Online Threat Enforcement Act to compel the Department of Justice to enforce laws prohibiting online violence against women, she tied her advocacy to personal experience, noting, \u201cI don\u2019t think any woman who has ever run for office isn\u2019t a little familiar with online harassment.\u201d Congresswomen remedy oversights to the benefit of other women. In the 114th Congress, Rep. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, worked with Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, to ensure that World War II Women Airforce Service Pilots could be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, citing her own military service as motivating her fight to honor those who came before her. After she was alerted to the possibility that women amputees were being underserved, Rep. Niki Tsongas, D-Massachusetts, included a provision in the 2015 National Defense Authorization Act that evaluated the Department of Defense\u2019s ability to provide the best prosthetic limbs for women. \u201cThose questions would never get asked without us here,\u201d she explained. Congresswomen bring a results-oriented approach to governing. One of the most common refrains among congresswomen we interviewed was their belief that women are more likely than men to focus on achievement over ego. Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-California, said, in line with research on women\u2019s motivation to run for office, \u201cI don\u2019t think women come here to be somebody. I think we come here to get things done.\u201d That results-oriented approach appears to motivate women\u2019s bipartisan work, work that has also been facilitated in part by the relationship-building they have done in single-sex spaces \u2013 including women\u2019s dinners, trips, and even sporting events. Brooke Baldwin: 2018 is the year of the woman on the ballot Women in Congress are not the antidote to partisan polarization; like men, they are partisan beings. But, across party lines, congresswomen do believe they are more likely than men to be problem-solvers rather than problem-makers. Congresswomen have worked to bring more women into their ranks. Many congresswomen are committed to increasing the numbers of women in political office. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-New York, told us about her commitment to meeting with young women \u201cto encourage them to step up to the plate and add their voices to the conversation.\u201d This year, she has led candidate recruitment for the National Republican Campaign Committee, with a particular emphasis on recruiting women. Almost universally, congresswomen believe that the influence of women in Congress would be greater if there were more of them. Congresswomen inspire the next generation of women leaders. Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-Ohio, described the symbolic importance of her presence in Congress as a black woman: \u201c(Having more women of color in Congress) makes a difference when little African-American girls can dream that they, too, can serve in Congress.\u201d As a little girl who \u201cnever thought I would be sitting in the United States Congress,\u201d Beatty described the privilege she feels in being able to make policy in Washington, DC and then \u201cgo back home and sit in the classroom or to sit in the neighborhood center and be able to honestly say, \u2018Somebody in this room \u2013 lots of you \u2013 can do this.\u2019\u201d  Disrupting expectations of who can and should lead will not only affect girls. As Rep. Susan Brooks, R-Indiana, notes, \u201cI think that we have to change the mindset not only of girls \u2026 we have to change the minds of boys and boys who support girls.\u201d",

Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. The news that the President\u2019s personal counsel, Michael Cohen, had secretly recorded conversations with his famous client was shocking to a lot of people \u2013 and particularly to his former client. President Donald Trump professed Cohen\u2019s actions to be \u201cinconceivable \u2026 unheard of & perhaps illegal.\u201d This was a harsh description of Cohen, whom Trump had previously described as a \u201cgood man,\u201d shortly after the FBI raided the lawyer\u2019s home and office to execute a search warrant as part of what Trump calls a \u201cWitch Hunt.\u201d But as Cohen\u2019s story takes the spotlight again, he has the potential to rise from the ashes of his shattered reputation and have his own \u201cJohn Dean\u201d moment. Dean\u2019s story, as counsel to Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal, was a political tale of disgrace and then redemption as Dean turned \u201cstate\u2019s evidence\u201d against a corrupt but powerful President. Lacking Dean\u2019s resume and poise, the rough-edged Cohen can only pull off a Dean story if he has incriminating information in his \u201cfixer\u201d files sufficient to force the resignation or impeachment of a President who seems impervious to scandal. Cohen's recording of Trump is a warning sign Though only in his mid-30s at the time, the young Dean held an impressive array of congressional and Justice Department posts before his appointment in 1970 as counsel to the President. By all accounts, Dean was a central figure in orchestrating the Watergate coverup. At one point, the FBI described Dean as the \u201cmaster manipulator\u201d of the coverup. Later, however, Dean became a national hero of sorts when he cooperated with federal prosecutors and congressional investigators in building a case against Nixon. His testimony before the Senate Watergate Committee, chaired by a folksy, self-described \u201ccountry lawyer\u201d named Sam Ervin, D-North Carolina, gripped the nation and struck fear in Nixon aides who had attempted to blame the whole scandal on Dean. Whether he would be believed, though, when contradicted by Nixon and his aides remained an open question \u2013 until a largely unknown presidential aide, Alexander Butterfield, revealed the existence of a White House taping system, which had recorded virtually all important Oval Office meetings, including those related to the coverup. The tapes confirmed Dean\u2019s testimony and doomed Nixon, his top aides and Attorney General John Mitchell. The deal that Dean cut with Watergate prosecutors included a felony plea, but he served only four months in custody at a federal \u201csafe house,\u201d which mostly consisted of lengthy conferences with prosecutors, FBI agents and investigators preparing for trials and the possible impeachment of Nixon. He was disbarred as an attorney but would later achieve success as an investment banker, author, lecturer and currently as a CNN contributor. Like Dean, Cohen may also face disciplinary action from bar authorities \u2013 though for a different offense. Dean\u2019s felony conviction led to his disbarment, while in Cohen\u2019s case, his disciplinary offense may be the potentially unethical recording of client conversations. More serious charges relating to his law license would follow if he is convicted of a serious crime, though none are currently lodged. The signs of a possible Cohen indictment are ominous. He has hired a new trial-ready attorney, and a Southern District Grand Jury was reportedly empaneled to investigate his case. All signs are that he is shopping for a deal, and people don\u2019t need a deal unless they fear indictment. And the attorney-client privilege may not shield the President from the files, records or even tape recordings of his personal attorney. A federal judge concluded that only a tiny fraction of the material seized fell within the ambit of the attorney-client privilege. The rest of the material was presumably business related or personal in nature. A client\u2019s deepest, darkest secrets \u2013 including even confessions of criminal conduct \u2013 are protected by the privilege only if revealed to an attorney in his role as an attorney. In other words, Trump\u2019s disclosures to Cohen are protected only if they were \u201cof or concerning\u201d legal matters. But like everything in the law, there are exceptions to the rule. One which could rear its head in the Cohen situation is the \u201ccrime-fraud\u201d exception. In other words, if Cohen was rendering advice to the President about how to structure \u201chush money\u201d payments in violation of federal election laws, such conversations would not be protected from disclosure. The law will not shield disclosure of an attorney-client conversation relating to the planning or commission of future crimes.  Even if the recordings do not reveal the planning of a future crime, their legality and admissibility could depend upon where the recordings were made. Some states require the assent of both parties to a recording, while others only require one. New York is a one-party state, meaning Cohen\u2019s consent alone may have rendered recording legal. Trump\u2019s location in another state would probably be unlikely to alter this analysis, as the party making the recording, Cohen, was located in a state where the action was legal. Though there may be some debate about this in legal circles, it is likely that the law in the jurisdiction where the recording was made, in this case New York, will govern. The prospect of Cohen\u2019s transformation into a historic figure of John Dean\u2019s importance, however, suffers from one potentially fatal obstacle. Dean\u2019s testimony related directly to Nixon\u2019s criminality in his role as President, while most of Cohen\u2019s tapes will undoubtedly pertain to Trump\u2019s activities prior to being sworn in as President. Cohen never had a job in the Trump administration. Under the circumstances, the President may survive the Cohen tapes, and history will view Cohen as \u201cJohn Dean Lite.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Callan is a CNN legal analyst, a former New York homicide prosecutor and current counsel at the New York law firm of Edelman & Edelman PC, focusing on wrongful conviction and civil rights cases. Follow him on Twitter @paulcallan. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. The search warrant raid on the office, home and hotel room of Michael Cohen, the personal counsel to the President, is an extraordinarily unusual and highly aggressive move by federal prosecutors.  It sends a strong message that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation has uncovered a lead suggesting criminality related to Cohen\u2019s law office probably unrelated to Mueller\u2019s Russia election meddling probe. Mueller has now developed evidence sufficient to persuade a federal judge that there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that Cohen has in his possession evidence of a crime. Most experienced criminal lawyers would likely suspect that the Stormy Daniels $130,000 \u201chush money\u201d payoff is the primary clue that sparked a closer look at Cohen\u2019s law office. Everything about the payment looks unusual, from Cohen\u2019s claim that he used a personal line of credit on his house to fund the payment to statements by both Cohen and the President that Mr. Trump knew nothing about the payment.  Lawyers don\u2019t customarily fund the contractual obligations of their clients as such actions can, depending on the circumstances, constitute unethical conduct by the attorney fronting or \u201cgifting\u201d the funds. Why dismissing Stormy Daniels' story would be a mistake In addition, the timing of the $130,000 payment so close to the presidential election may suggest an unreported and illegal campaign contribution. How the money is treated for tax purposes may also trigger other legal concerns. Payments to people who claim to have had affairs with public figures  are not currently tax deductible under the IRS Code even if your primary residences are Trump Tower and the White House. The search warrants may uncover evidence of prior payoffs and the feds will have a strong interest in where the money came from and whether it was deducted as a Trump or Cohen business expense. Of course the search may also exonerate both men of any criminal conduct. Cohen may have other problems. It is unethical for an attorney to act on behalf of a client without consulting the client. If Trump was not advised by Cohen that he had negotiated a $130,000 non-disclosure agreement with a porn actress prohibiting her from revealing anything suggesting an intimate relationship with Trump one month before the presidential election, he certainly should have been. Stormy Daniels' interview holds a mirror up to Trump and the picture isn't pretty Cohen and the President have left room in their various accounts of the Daniels payment for Cohen to claim that as a long-time adviser, attorney and friend of the President he had been given general authority to act on behalf of Trump. That claim may get Cohen off the ethics hook but the whole Daniels \u201chush money\u201d and Karen McDougal \u201ccatch and kill\u201d deals look sleazy. It is hardly surprising that prosecutors would want to take a closer look. If the crime were directly related to Mueller\u2019s \u201cRussia collusion\u201d probe as the President is fond of describing his investigation, most of the heavy lifting regarding procurement and execution of the warrant would likely have been handled by Mueller\u2019s office. Instead initial reports suggest the search warrant was largely handled by the office of US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Geoffrey Berman, a recent Trump appointee. Berman is also the former law partner of Rudolph Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s early supporters and advisers. The fact that the search warrant was obtained and executed by the US Attorney for the Southern District rather than by the Office of Special Counsel Mueller clearly indicates that the special counsel was well aware that he was proceeding in a new direction that could subject him to criticism that he was exceeding his mandate. It is also clear that if a prosecutor becomes aware of the commission of any crime, he has the lawful duty to follow the evidence. Mueller (or his supervisor Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein) appears to have acted sensibly in referring the matter to the leading federal law enforcement official locally, the Manhattan based US Attorney, for proper follow-up. Stormy, don't worry about violating your NDA This seizure of evidence pursuant to search warrant on an attorney\u2019s office is a highly unusual and dangerous maneuver by any prosecutor. The attorney-client privilege protects most attorney records, and the courts, even when issuing a search warrant directed at an attorney\u2019s office, require protection of legitimately \u201cprivileged\u201d documents. Failure to protect such information can lead to court sanctions or even dismissal of a case. The FBI and Justice Department use lawyers and investigators walled off from the primary investigation to sift through the documents to prepare a \u201cprivilege log\u201d for later submission to the court. At least in theory these \u201ctaint\u201d teams remove any legitimately privileged items from examination by the primary investigators putting the case together. Or at least that is how it is supposed to work, though some of us who are criminal defense lawyers may be skeptical. There remains a very important exception to the attorney-client privilege called the \u201ccrime-fraud\u201d exception. If the attorney and the client are conspiring to commit a crime and use the attorney-client privilege to cover up the conspiracy, under law the privilege is automatically waived. The lawyer Trump wants to represent him has been dead for 32 years New York federal prosecutors will be carefully sifting through Cohen\u2019s records in search of any evidence that he conspired with his primary client, the President of the United States, to commit a crime.  And the one thing we know for sure, a federal judge has reviewed the warrant application and has determined that there is \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that Cohen\u2019s law office records contain evidence of some kind of a serious crime: a crime so serious that this judge permitted a raid on the office of the President\u2019s personal lawyer.  Something is up and President Trump\u2019s latest musings about firing Mueller won\u2019t make it go away. The new cop on this beat is Trump\u2019s own appointee, US Attorney Berman, who like all federal prosecutors is ethically required to follow the evidence of a crime wherever it leads even if not in the direction of Russia\u2026but instead into Trump Tower.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN and The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. If there is one thing we have learned since Donald Trump took office is that we should not confuse the unthinkable with the impossible. That\u2019s why we should pay attention to the President\u2019s words in a private meeting with Republican donors when he told them he might try to become president for life. Was it a joke? Was it a promise? Was it an innocent, meaningless musing? No one really knows. Trump is an illusionist. He\u2019s a manipulator standing on the stage with a fog machine, trying to distort our sense of reality and direct our attention where he wants it. When he ruminated aloud about staying at the White House forever, Trump was surely not launching a \u201cTrump for life\u201d campaign or announcing his intention to change or ignore the Constitution. But there is also little doubt from his track record that Trump finds the checks and balances of democracy highly inconvenient. He openly admires dictators. When he speaks of other countries\u2019 strongmen he sounds envious. He made the comments Saturday, during a fundraising lunch at Mar-a-Lago. CNN obtained a tape of Trump talking in the closed meeting about China\u2019s President Xi Jinping, the increasingly authoritarian leader who just had term limits abolished so that he can stay in power for the rest of his life. \u201cI think it\u2019s great,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMaybe we\u2019ll have to give that a shot some day.\u201d The audience laughed. Xi Jinping is giving Autocrats Anonymous a rebrand This response to the gaslighter in chief is nothing new. He mixes lies and truths in a swirly haze, but also reveals his true feelings even as he tries to confuse us, saying he was just joking, or was misquoted, or he never said what we all heard him say. It\u2019s all part of his act. Trump\u2019s impulses are already in the mold of an autocrat. He is restrained only by the democratic rules that still survive his tenure. Like dictators do, he hates the media \u2013 unless it reports only glowingly about him. Like tyrants, he wants to sic the Justice Department and the FBI on his political opponents. Like most rulers, he loves nothing more than to stand  in a sea of raucous admirers, soaking in their adulation, stoking their hatred for those he sees as the enemy. Trump sells himself as the macho president. The man who threatens fire and fury like the world has never seen. But, instead, his insatiable thirst for praise makes him vulnerable. And that weakness makes American vulnerable. Foreign governments know that Trump can be seduced with flattery. So they manipulate the President and US foreign policy by treating Trump like the king he wishes he were. Target in Putin's nuke video looks like Florida From the days of the campaign we heard it. Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump said, \u201ccalled me a genius.\u201d That\u2019s not exactly what happened, but Trump believed it, and it helped add to the mysteriously voluminous reservoir of respect that Trump holds for the Russian president. Trump\u2019s admiration for Putin seems boundless. \u201cHe is really very much of a leader,\u201d he said during the campaign\u2026the man has very strong control over the country.\u201d The combination of admiration for Putin, belief that Putin has great respect for him, and whatever else there may be in that relationship, has contributed to Trump \u2013 the supposedly macho President \u2013 acting like a pussycat when it comes to Russia. Trump finds it impossible to criticize Putin. He has failed to enact sanctions already approved by Congress, and the State Department has not touched the $120 million allocated to fight Russian election interference. And in a shocking new revelation, a New Yorker article says the Kremlin reportedly instructed Trump not to choose Mitt Romney as secretary of state and choose someone more sympathetic to Russia. After dangling the job before Romney, who had called Russia \u201cthe single greatest threat to America,\u201d Trump chose Rex Tillerson, who had just received a medal from Putin. Trump may be the weakest of weak presidents when it comes to Russia, but he has the highest regard for strongmen, even \u2013 perhaps especially \u2013 the ones who systematically dismantle democracy. Is Trump applying authoritarian tactics? Putin? \u201cHe\u2019s getting an \u2018A\u2019,\u201d Trump declared. Turkey\u2019s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is also laying the groundwork for an all-powerful, endless presidency? He is \u201cgetting very high marks,\u201d Trump said, even as human rights and democracy monitoring organizations raised the alarm about his attack on free speech and democracy, and Erdogan becomes effectively a dictator. Trump called it \u201ca great honor and privilege,\u201d to introduce Erdogan in a press conference. Then there\u2019s that other object of Trumpian admiration, Rodrigo Duterte, the President of the Philippines who has unleashed a brutal war against suspected drug traffickers \u2013 a campaign that a recent investigation found has left more than 12,000 people dead without any semblance of due process \u2013 while attacking judges and journalists who dare criticize him. Trump praised him for doing \u201can unbelievable job on the drug problem.\u201d And, of course, there\u2019s Xi, the Chinese president who took a country that was already a dictatorship, a prolific human rights violator, and tightened the screws on critics even further, massing more power for himself, now securing the top job for as long as he wants it. Despite all his tough talk against China during the campaign, once in office Trump called Xi \u201ca very good man,\u201d no matter Xi\u2019s harsh crackdown.  And after Xi rolled out the thickest red carpet possible to flatter him during his visit to China, Trump sounded genuinely stirred by the lavish reception.  Now Trump is even more impressed with Xi\u2019s move to secure power potentially for life. \u201cLook,\u201d he told donors at Mar-a-Lago, \u201che was able to do that. I think it\u2019s great.\u201d Does Trump want to be like Xi? Does the President of the United States want to upend the foundational creed of the Republic, the notion that power should change hands regularly to someone chosen by the people? That seems unfathomable. And yet, history has shown time and again that just because something is unthinkable it doesn\u2019t mean it cannot happen.",

            "article_content": "CIA Director Mike Pompeo made a secret trip to North Korea\u00a0a few weeks ago and met with Kim Jong Un, sources tell CNN. Pompeo reportedly was laying the groundwork for direct talks between Kim, the reclusive nation\u2019s brutal dictator, and President Trump. That meeting \u2013 planned for late May or early June \u2013\u00a0would be the first face-to-face meeting between a sitting US President and a North Korean leader. Trump said five locations are being considered. This extraordinary\u00a0revelation comes as Pompeo\u2019s nomination for secretary of state hits a rough patch. It looks like the\u00a0Senate Foreign Relations Committee will vote against it, with all Democrats and one Republican in that camp.

The matriarch of the most powerful Republican dynasty in modern history has died. Former first lady Barbara Bush, 92, was the wife and mother of Presidents, but she was so much more than that. Instantly recognizable with her white hair and pearls, she was a plainspoken yet feisty public figure who adopted literacy as her cause. She promoted women\u2019s rights and was such a strong defender of her husband, former President George H.W. Bush, that she earned the moniker, \u201cthe enforcer.\u201d Bush redefined the role of first lady, CNN contributor Kate Andersen Brower said. Among the flood of tributes pouring in, perhaps the most poignant came from her family, including former first lady Laura Bush, who tweeted, \u201cThe world is poorer without her in it.\u201d It reads like a scene out of a Hollywood thriller: A piece of a plane engine breaks off in midair, shatters a window, and a mom in a window seat is halfway sucked out of the plane before terrified passengers haul her back in; then, despite their heroism, she dies. This horror story was all too real on a New York-to-Dallas Southwest Airlines flight that made an emergency landing in Philadelphia. Investigators say one of the engine\u2019s 24 fan blades is missing. The plane took a steep dive after the engine\u00a0failure, dropping from 31,684 to 10,000 feet over five minutes before the pilot regained control. There was absolute panic in the cabin, where passengers and crew, after pulling the victim back in, tried to plug the hole with jackets and other objects. Those objects were sucked out, too. The victim, 43-year-old Jennifer Riordan, was a well-known leader in New Mexico who worked for Wells Fargo. The frontrunner in Brazil\u2019s upcoming presidential election was stabbed during a rally.

Bolsonaro\u2019s known for making\u00a0racist, sexist and homophobic remarks, but he\u2019s attracted millions\u00a0of supporters who believe he can shake up Brazil\u2019s corruption-marred political class.

Some of the children were as young as 14. UNICEF hopes to release a thousand more in coming months. The UN agency has freed 500 child soldiers this year. But the work is far from done. Thousands of children have been forced to take up arms in the oil-rich country, which has been in a civil conflict for five years. An estimated 19,000 children serve in the armed forces and other groups in South Sudan. \u201cWith all due respect, I don\u2019t get confused.\u201d UN ambassador Nikki Haley, hitting back after the White House implied she got ahead of President Trump\u2019s decision-making when she said the administration would soon announce new sanctions against Russia.
