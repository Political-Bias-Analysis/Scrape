            "article_content": "The second New York Police Department officer who was shot while responding to a domestic incident in Harlem last week has died, the NYPD commissioner said. \u201cIt\u2019s with great sadness I announce the passing of Police Officer Wilbert Mora,\u201d NYPD Commissioner Keechant Sewell said on Twitter. \u201cWilbert is 3 times a hero. For choosing a life of service. For sacrificing his life to protect others. For giving life even in death through organ donation. Our heads are bowed & our hearts are heavy.\u201d Mora, 27, and Officer Jason Rivera, 22, were fatally shot Friday when a suspected gunman opened fire in a Harlem apartment, authorities said. The suspect, Lashawn McNeil, tried to run but was confronted and shot by a third officer on the scene, police said. McNeil died on Monday. Mora and Rivera are just two of five NYPD officers who have been shot in the nation\u2019s largest city in the first month of 2022. In addition, a woman was pushed onto the subway tracks in Times Square and a baby was hit in the face by crossfire in the Bronx. These acts of violence under a new city administration \u2013 coming off a year that saw an increase in homicides \u2013 have dramatically changed the tenor of policing in New York City over the course of just a few days. Now, as officials enact plans to stem violent crime and illegal gun ownership, the city is preparing for the return of plainclothes units that had been disbanded nearly two years earlier. Mayor Eric Adams, a former New York Police Department captain who began his term less than four weeks ago, touted his law and order experience during the election campaign. Now, lawlessness has become his biggest immediate challenge following a spate of high-profile attacks on residents and police alike. Attacks at subway stations \u2013 with people being pushed onto the tracks \u2013 has transportation officials warning riders to stay away from the edge of platforms. Eric Adams has been mayor of NYC for 24 days. He's already at a crossroads \u201cI don\u2019t want to tell people that they should stand on subway platforms and feel like they\u2019re, you know, they\u2019re in threat of their lives,\u201d Metropolitan Transit Authority chair and CEO Janno Lieber told CNN affiliate WABC on Sunday. \u201cBut everybody should stand away from the edge of the platform.\u201d To try to provide greater security on city streets, Adams said a plainclothes unit will be reinstituted within the next three weeks to curb rising crime and gun violence. \u201cWe have to make sure we don\u2019t continue to put dangerous people back on the street and continue the flow of guns in our cities,\u201d Adams told CNN\u2019s John Berman on Tuesday on \u201cNew Day.\u201d The unit will patrol in unmarked vehicles while wearing clothing identifying officers as law enforcement, Adams announced Monday, adding that the new unit will be in addition to those already on the streets since August who patrol in unmarked vehicles while wearing police uniforms. The mayor also laid out in a \u201cBlueprint to End Gun Violence\u201d goals to improve mental health care, launch a new youth engagement program to intercept those at risk from potential criminal behavior, improve communication between legal jurisdictions and increase the number of judges available. \u201cNew Yorkers will see and feel these changes quickly,\u201d Adams said. \u201cWe will ramp up enforcement, deploy more officers on the streets and in the subways, and get our courts at full capacity.\u201d While Adams made no secret during his campaign that he wanted a more active police force, the speed in which events were put in motion was hastened by the shooting death of Officer Rivera on Friday. The gun used in Friday\u2019s shooting, a Glock 45, was stolen from Baltimore in 2017 and had a magazine that can hold up to 40 additional rounds, according to NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig. The suspect had another gun under his mattress, Adams said Monday. \u201cHe could have emptied out his 40 (bullets) and still had another automatic assault weapon for every responding officer who responded,\u201d he said. The availability of illegal firearms has been paid particular attention, with Gov. Kathy Hochul announcing a multistate effort with federal authorities to get more weapons off the street. Jason Rivera, the 22-year-old NYPD officer killed in the line of duty, devoted his life to helping others Services for Rivera will take place Thursday and Friday at St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York, the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York said. Sewell, the NYPD Commissioner, announced Mora\u2019s death in an internal memo provided to CNN by a law enforcement official. \u201cThe grief in this Department is incalculable. We will stand, salute and shed tears, yet manage to smile as we remember him during the extremely difficult days ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cPolice officers Wilbert Mora and Jason Rivera were dedicated, courageous and compassionate officers, loved by many. The pain their families feel is immeasurable. We pray for them; we will be strong for them.\u201d \u201cYou put yourselves in harm\u2019s way every day to make this city safer. You are honoring the legacy and sacrifice of Jason and Wilbert, all while keeping our solemn vow to never forget our two fallen heroes.\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement that Mora was \u201ca hero until the end.\u201d \u201cOfficer Mora and his partner, Officer Jason Rivera, showed courage in the face of imminent danger to protect New Yorkers,\u201d James said. \u201cTheir bravery exemplified their commitment to protecting the city they loved. Both will forever be remembered as heroes who dedicated their lives to making New York safer and stronger,\u201d James said. Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association police union, said Mora \u201cwill live on in the heart of every New York City police officer from this day forward\u201d and that he \u201cshowed us what it means to carry out our mission with courage, skill and humanity.\u201d As the city moves forward with the return of plainclothes units, some community leaders and advocates are questioning whether the mayor\u2019s plan is an appropriate course of action. Some critics derided plainclothes units for years as counterproductive and argued they were a relic from the stop-and-frisk era of policing, used instead as a bludgeoning tool that more negatively affected Black and brown communities. Rivera had prior experience with the stop-and-frisk policy before joining the force. Writing to a commanding officer while in police academy less than two years ago, he detailed a negative experience with his brother who was frisked, and said he was moved by later NYPD efforts to get away from such tactics. Domestic incidents are highly dangerous for police officers, experts say He wanted to be the first person in his family to become a police officer in what he called \u201cthe greatest police force in the world,\u201d he wrote, intent on pursuing a career. The NYPD reassigned plainclothes officers off such assignments in 2020, closing a controversial chapter of the city\u2019s anti-crime units. And a group of public defender groups \u2013 while lauding other aspects of the mayor\u2019s initiative on mental health and youth services \u2013 expressed reservations about bringing back such units. \u201cReinstating the NYPD\u2019s Anti-Crime Unit without also addressing the culture and policies that drove that unit\u2019s decades-long pattern of harassment and violence targeting Black and brown New Yorkers is a mistake,\u201d The Legal Aid Society, Brooklyn Defender Services, The Bronx Defenders and The Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem and Queens Defenders said in a joint statement Monday. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement gives the community members who live with the legacy of hyper-aggressive policing no comfort that Mayor Adams\u2019s Anti-Crime Unit will be different from its predecessors,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe Mayor must focus on addressing long standing problems with NYPD\u2019s culture of impunity before he doubles down on strategies that will only perpetuate the harms of that culture.\u201d The rise in violent crime and the recent shootings of police officers are not unprecedented circumstances for a New York City mayor who is just taking office, according to Susan Kang, associate professor of political science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. What is unique, Kang said, is how quickly the five shootings occurred within just a short period of time after Adams was inaugurated. \u201cIn terms of a political narrative and the way it dominates the news cycle, it\u2019s certainly making a strong impression on people\u2019s assessment of Mayor Adams,\u201d Kang said. Mayor Eric Adams acknowledges New Yorkers don't feel safe in the subways \u201cThe increased perceptions of violence matter and they put Adams in a tough spot because he really sold himself as the guy who would make public safety a backbone of his campaign,\u201d she added. \u201cI think it was a mistake because a lot of aspects of public safety are not related to things that a mayor can necessarily do. A lot of it has to do with larger socioeconomic issues.\u201d Kang said Adams is tasked with figuring out a way to \u201cplacate his critics\u201d as there are concerns police reform efforts will be scaled backward in an \u201cattempt to weed out the gun violence.\u201d Stu Loeser, former press secretary for Mayor Michael Bloomberg, told CNN that the recent shootings of NYPD officers have presented Adams with the right time and public attention to roll out his policing agenda. \u201cI don\u2019t think any mayor other than Eric Adams, in his third week in office, could propose a massive reshaping of criminal justice reform in New York,\u201d Loeser said. Adams\u2019 mayoral campaign focused on the message that he has the \u201cunique ability and credibility\u201d to spur changes in policing while improving public safety, Loeser said. \u201cHe knows more about policing than anyone else in politics,\u201d he said. \u201cHe ran on the premise that he was able to fix this as a career police officer, as someone who performed within the police department throughout his career.\u201d America's crime wave tests both parties In an interview before Mora\u2019s death was announced, Queens Borough President Donovan Richards told CNN the fatal shooting of Rivera, who wanted to improve the relationship between officers and the public, \u201cstruck a different chord\u201d across the city in many Black and Brown communities that continue to call for better policing. \u201cAs we talk about crime perception versus reality, when we see officers being shot \u2013 whether it\u2019s a perception problem, whether murders are down, whether shootings are down, is beside the question,\u201d Richards said. \u201cIf the people who we trust to protect us and serve us are not safe in the streets, how can the everyday New Yorker walk down the block and feel safe?\u201d Adams, who is only the second Black mayor in the city\u2019s history, has said he is keenly aware of overcoming the gaps between communities and a police agency historically at odds. \u201cThere\u2019s a subtext to this story that I don\u2019t want to be missed,\u201d he said at a vigil for the officers Saturday. \u201cThe three officers that were involved, two of them were born outside this country, one in India and one in the Dominican Republic, the third is a first generation.\u201d \u201cAnd so when you start talking about the contribution of the immigrant community to this city, you better understand the reality that they are putting their lives on the line for the city and country that they love,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Most Americans lack confidence that the results of US elections reflect the will of the people, a sentiment that has grown steadily since January 2021, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. And about half of Americans, 48%, say they think it is at least somewhat likely that in the next few years, some elected officials will successfully overturn the results of a US election because their party did not win. Follow-up interviews with people who participated in the poll suggest that the driving factors behind Republicans\u2019 and Democrats\u2019 views on elections are near-opposite. But there is a common thread: Concern. When asked her outlook on the future of American democracy, Patricia Reasoner, an 83-year-old independent from Vermont, said, \u201cI\u2019m concerned because we came so close this time and we\u2019re not putting enough controls in place to keep it from happening again so far. And if it happens again, I\u2019m afraid it will topple us.\u201d In January 2021, shortly after the attack on the US Capitol, 59% of Americans said they had at least some confidence that US elections reflected the will of the people. That included 36% who were very confident that elections were representative of the public\u2019s wishes. Now, a year and a half later, only 42% have some confidence, and just 16% are very confident. The biggest shifts over that time have come among Democrats and independents, even as Democrats remain the political group most likely to express confidence in American elections. In early 2021, 90% of Democrats said they were at least somewhat confident that elections reflected the will of the people; now, just 57% are. Among independents, the share who have at least some confidence has fallen from 54% to 38%. Among Republicans, by contrast, confidence has modestly increased but remained low, from 23% confident then to 29% now. CNN Poll: Most Americans believe that government and society can take action on preventing mass shootings Kelly Woodward, a teacher and parent from Denver, where all voters receive mail ballots, said her experience of voting has been largely positive. \u201cI take both girls when I do it, when I drop off the ballot, and they sit with me as I\u2019m filling it out. I know for my parents, who are older and are both very politically active, it\u2019s very easy for them, which I appreciate, because it would be hard for them to go stand in line.\u201d But Woodward, a Democrat, has concerns about how well the system works elsewhere. \u201cEven though it works for me, I don\u2019t think it works for everybody, and it shouldn\u2019t be that way in our country. It should be the same for everybody; they should feel that it works for them.\u201d Some worried that not everyone who should be able to vote actually could. LaRee Smith, a health care worker in Washington state said in an email to CNN, \u201c[M]y biggest concern is not for myself but for voters in states (particularly in the South) where conservatives appear to be ramping up voter suppression and intimidation for citizens in lower socioeconomic classes.\u201d And Isaac Odibo, a Democrat from Norfolk, Virginia, said the nation\u2019s election system is weaker now because, \u201ca lot of people qualified to vote might be prevented from voting because of all the laws placed and new laws being passed.\u201d But on the other side, Republicans\u2019 concerns seem rooted in doubts about the last presidential election, even as there has been no evidence of either voter fraud or tampering that would change the results. Despite the lack of evidence, numerous candidates for office and former President Donald Trump continue to push the falsehood that the election was stolen. Still, Ruben Andres Delgado, a 26-year-old Republican from El Paso, Texas, said of 2020, \u201cAnyone with logic and reasoning could tell you something fishy happened, something illegitimate happened.\u201d And another survey-taker from Northport, Alabama, who did not wish to be named, said, \u201cThere were instances of polls going smoothly and turning in the true vote count. But there were also instances that were claims from viewers and people working the polls that that didn\u2019t take place, so there was a question mark.\u201d The survey was conducted as the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol held public hearings on its findings. CNN Poll: Most voters say neither Republican nor Democratic congressional candidates have the right priorities Woodward has been following the hearings a little bit. \u201cI just never thought in my lifetime that I would have seen something like January 6,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess there\u2019s a fear of if that could happen, and if there aren\u2019t any lasting consequences for the individuals who participated, does that just leave the door open for that to happen again? I do place great importance on the hearings, and sort of the precedent that that sets that this cannot happen in our country.\u201d Susan Loconsole, a Democrat from Carol Stream, Illinois, who has been watching as much of the hearings as she can and said she felt \u201cdevastated\u201d by the attack, believes the election system has been weakened in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s suddenly any more fraud or anything different going on,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one person saying there was and having so many people that believe everything he says, that they now have taken that as their message. There in itself is the most frightening thing in this country.\u201d Americans\u2019 views on the likelihood that an election in the US would be overturned for partisan reasons have held steady at a roughly even split since last summer. Republicans (53% very or somewhat likely) and Democrats (49%) are about equally apt to say it is likely an election would be overturned, but Republicans are more likely to see such an outcome as \u201cvery\u201d likely (21% among Republicans vs. 11% among Democrats). The poll participant from Alabama, a retired teacher who backed Trump in 2020, said, \u201cI still have my values, so I\u2019m going to vote for the candidate that I normally would vote for, but there\u2019s a concern about the correct candidates that are truly elected being put in office.\u201d Transparency, the respondent said, was key. \u201cMake sure the true vote is shown, whether it\u2019s the vote I want or not, it should be the true vote, the true voice of the American people.\u201d CNN Poll: Most Americans are discontented with Biden, the economy and the state of the country Loconsole, the Democrat from Illinois, expressed faith that the results would be trustworthy. \u201cI will, again, trust the system in the next election, even if that means that the Republicans take over.\u201d And when asked about her views on the future of American democracy, Woodward, the teacher from Colorado, said, \u201cI\u2019m an optimist. I have to be to wake up and vote and to watch the news. I am optimistic that people will do the right thing and that we\u2019ll find a way to come together, also because I have children and teach children. I just have to think that good things are on the horizon, and that we can do this.\u201d The new CNN poll was conducted by SSRS June 13 through July 13 among a random national sample of 1,459 adults initially reached by mail, and is the third survey CNN has conducted using this methodology. Surveys were either conducted online or by telephone with a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.

            "article_content": "Some things have changed in the two weeks since Hakeem Jeffries learned \u2013 from listening to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s speech, sitting motionless with an intentional blank expression on his face for those who were watching \u2013 that she really was going to step aside. His phone is ringing more. He\u2019s being stopped more in the hallways of the Capitol. On a small table in his hideaway office in the Capitol, there\u2019s a platter of scones and a bowl of fresh raspberries as refreshments for the many guests filing in, from \u201csquad\u201d member Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib on Thursday evening to the law enforcement officer representatives who came in on Friday morning. Some things are the same. Jeffries is still carefully working out in advance what he wants to say at every public appearance, delivering those rehearsed comments deliberately enough that reporters\u2019 automated transcription programs inserts extra periods they assume must be there to fill the spaces. He\u2019s still the cautious operator who nixed calls from colleagues in a private post-midterms meeting to jump out ahead and challenge Pelosi. With Hakeem Jeffries' rise, his members see 'Democrats in total array' The new leader of the Democrats in the House insists that he hasn\u2019t had time to take it in, or even to reflect on making history as the first Black leader in Congress. What matters, he said, is getting his party back to the majority in 2024 \u2013 and likely then getting himself to be speaker. In an interview with CNN \u2013 his first with a major outlet since officially being elected to the post on Wednesday \u2013 the Brooklyn-born Democrat laid out his plan to get there, starting with hoping the president runs for reelection, in part, Jeffries said, because that would be better than an open field for Democrats trying to win against Republicans in swing districts that Joe Biden carried in 2020. He wants to pre-empt, or at least absorb, the complaints from the party\u2019s left flank, which has expanded its footprint among House Democrats and has been suspicious of him, despite the unanimous vote he received. And ripping into both House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, Jeffries said he\u2019s also counting on Republicans being unable to distance themselves from extremism to make the case for them. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible to me that even at this point in time, as they\u2019re on their way temporarily into the majority, they have not articulated a vision for addressing the economic concerns of the American people,\u201d Jeffries said of Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s because there\u2019s a real risk that the incoming Republican majority is being hijacked by the extremists who have grown in ranks.\u201d The outgoing House Democratic leadership team are all in their 80s. The three members of Jeffries\u2019 closely aligned, constantly coordinating leadership team of incoming Minority Whip Katherine Clark of Massachusetts and incoming Democratic Caucus Chair Pete Aguilar of California are so new that none were in Congress when Barack Obama was first elected. There\u2019s a sincere buzz among many Democratic members and their aides about what the new order means. It\u2019s coupled, though, with the silver lining of being in the minority: Jeffries will have time to learn a job that over the years some have come to believe only Pelosi could handle. The concerns aren\u2019t just about Jeffries\u2019 ability to count votes. Members and Democratic operatives point to his lack of an extensive fundraising network, or of a political team with much experience outside of Brooklyn. What he does have is two years\u2019 worth of taking swings at Republicans at weekly news conferences, often at McCarthy \u2013 whom he tends to call just \u201cKevin\u201d and insists he\u2019s been \u201cpretty gentle\u201d on despite all the whacks he\u2019s taken. GOP tension builds over House speaker race as McCarthy and critics prep for floor fight Asked whether he believes there is common ground to be found with McCarthy, who\u2019s trying to hold off an internal revolt to be elected the new speaker, Jeffries demurred. Asked to describe what he thinks of McCarthy, Jeffries said only, \u201cWe serve in Congress together,\u201d and stopped talking. Asked if he respects McCarthy, Jeffries said, \u201cI respect the fact that he is the current House Republican leader, and depending on what happens on January 3, may be the next Republican speaker.\u201d On Thursday, McConnell used part of a speech on the Senate floor to rip into Jeffries for being \u201ca past election denier\u201d because he called the 2016 election \u201cquote, \u2018illegitimate,\u2019 and suggested that we had a quote \u2018fake president,\u2019\u201d which a McConnell aide said was just his way of laying down a marker. Jeffries called McConnell\u2019s speech \u201cunfortunate\u201d but part of what he said is a familiar pattern of Republican attacks. \u201cIf McConnell wants to lean into the fact that I\u2019ve been critical of [Donald] Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 the overwhelming majority of the world is critical of Trump\u2019s presidency,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cThat didn\u2019t seem to make a lot of sense to me. But he\u2019ll do what he does, and I want to stay focused on fighting for the people.\u201d Jeffries offered one suggestion for common ground: restoring the enhanced child tax credit, which provided families with several hundred dollars per month for six months before expiring at the end of 2021. Some Democrats, most notably West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, opposed keeping it at the original levels. But Jeffries said he\u2019s ready to highlight the difference between that money, which had a transformative effect on child poverty and which boosted the middle class, and what he refers to as the \u201cGOP tax scam\u201d of the 2017 Republican tax cuts signed by Trump. The enhanced child tax credit passed initially as part of the Covid-era American Rescue Plan in the spring of 2021, without a single Republican vote in the House or Senate. The luxury of being in the minority, though, is being able to criticize and contrast without having to work out actual deals that his own members have to agree to. \u201cThe job of the minority leader is to become the speaker,\u201d said Massachusetts Rep. Jake Auchincloss, who quickly joined Jeffries\u2019 advisory team as a freshman member. \u201cThere\u2019s widespread agreement in the caucus that we\u2019ve got a formula here for 2024: We\u2019ve got to hang together, we\u2019ve got to allow the GOP to audition for two years to the American people.\u201d Jeffries was in diapers when Biden was first elected to the Senate and in grade school when Chuck Schumer was first elected to the House, and he began his first term in the New York State Assembly the same year Pelosi first won as speaker. But as pointed out by many in a caucus where even millennials are starting to rack up seniority, it\u2019s less a question of age than of life experience and sensibility. Jeffries was a teenager in Brooklyn during the crack epidemic. By the time he first arrived in Washington, Twitter had already ended a few politicians\u2019 careers. His two public employee parents named him Hakeem and his brother Hasan, but he came of age and into politics thinking more about tackling systemic racism than marching in the civil rights movement. The younger brother grew up to be a noted professor of Black history. Jeffries is now the highest-ranking Black politician ever in America, other than Obama and Vice President Kamala Harris, in a building with a foundation laid by slaves. The head of the most diverse leadership team in the history of Congress, Jeffries stepped in when an African dance troupe invited him to join them at a Juneteenth celebration back home last summer. He is a regular at services at the Cornerstone Baptist Church back home. House Democrats pick Hakeem Jeffries to succeed Nancy Pelosi, the first Black lawmaker to lead a party in Congress Yet in a conversation the night before his unanimous election last week, the intensely private congressman repeatedly insisted to several skeptical reporters that he really hadn\u2019t spent much time thinking about making history. He\u2019d been too busy nailing down votes, dealing with lame-duck session priorities and preparing to move into the minority. Asked whether in the new role he would prioritize some of the criminal justice reform efforts that have been a cause since he was a state legislator, Jeffries spoke about a focus on rebuilding economic access to the American dream, whether that meant addressing the drop in unionization or the rise in automation. People can misread Jeffries\u2019s heart because of his style, said Rev. Al Sharpton, who has known the congressman for two decades and called his election as House minority leader \u201can embodiment of the dream of Black political power we\u2019ve had second only to the president of the United States.\u201d \u201cHe is an activist, but he has always said, \u2018I\u2019m the guy to go inside the room \u2013 I\u2019m not the guy to go to jail and be handcuffed,\u2019\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cBut we can trust him in the room. His ambition never outran his agenda.\u201d Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who, in 2020, won a primary from the left against a longtime incumbent New Yorker whom Jeffries had endorsed, said he\u2019s excited to have the new perspective at the helm. He downplayed progressive complaints from the past. \u201cFor the most part, he believes what I believe,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cSo now it\u2019s a question of how to make that work.\u201d Some hope his elevation means a higher priority on urban issues, but Jeffries has been pushing to think in terms of what it takes to win enough seats to govern. \u201cWe have to show up in unexpected places, show up early, engage in authentic conversations and then deliver results,\u201d he said, pledging to do some of that showing-up personally through \u201con the ground conversations with Americans throughout the country \u2013 in the heartland, in Appalachia and in rural America.\u201d Pelosi is such a presence that even those who were helping Jeffries prepare for her departure struggle to imagine life without her involved. \u201cWhat do you do if you have a guru? You go sit down at her knee and say, \u2018Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on, what do you think?\u2019\u201d said Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, who\u2019s been working with Jeffries for years. In response, a Pelosi spokesperson pointed CNN to her line from before Thanksgiving, when she said she has \u201cno intention of being the mother-in-law in the kitchen, saying, \u2018My son doesn\u2019t like the stuffing that way. This is the way we make it.\u2019\u201d Nancy Pelosi announces she won't run for leadership post, marking the end of an era Pelosi was serious, the spokesperson said: The caucus voted to officially designate her \u201cspeaker emerita,\u201d but she really is planning to step back. Many of her colleagues, along with most political players back in San Francisco, believe she wants to help position her daughter, Christine, to succeed her in Congress. They speculate that may mean she\u2019ll spend a lot of time in the district instead, building back bridges. Jeffries said he is not planning on keeping the kind of international schedule Pelosi did, especially in recent years, when she would pop over to Europe or Asia on weekends. He acknowledges that he doesn\u2019t have anything like Pelosi\u2019s depth of friendship with Biden, which has made her someone the president has often relied on. Jeffries has talked about having a more open leadership style. Democrats in the House rave about how every time they\u2019re in their chamber to vote, they get checked in on by either Jeffries, Clark or Aguilar. But many still struggle to name what they think his own policy priorities are, what motivates him or how he makes decisions. Asked directly why he wanted to be leader, Jeffries said only, \u201cI just look forward to the opportunity to do the most good for the greatest number of people possible for as long as I have the opportunity to do so and can operate at the highest level.\u201d In the meantime, Jeffries is still wrapping his head around his new life, which will soon involve being trailed around by an official security detail from the US Capitol Police. \u201cI\u2019m just taking the approach of what has to be done today, what has to be done tomorrow, what has to be done this week, what has to be done this month? And then what has to be done to be successful over the next few years?\u201d he said, explaining that he finds that to be \u201cthe only way to approach this without suffering from high anxiety.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Democrats\u2019 budget reconciliation package, which contains several landmark climate and health care provisions, was signed into law by President Joe Biden Tuesday. The House passed the legislation, titled the Inflation Reduction Act, Friday after being approved by the Senate on August 7 on a party-line vote. Still, the effort remains a mere shadow of the sweeping $3.5 trillion reconciliation package that the majority party initially floated last year. After torpedoing the inclusion of any climate or tax provisions in mid-July, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat, reversed course. The measures join a handful of important but narrow provisions to lower prescription drug prices and to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years. Gone are the creation of a universal pre-K program, an extension of the enhanced child tax credit, an expansion of Medicare benefits, the establishment of a federally funded paid family and sick leave program and many other provisions aimed at broadening the nation\u2019s social safety net. The deal is far smaller than the slimmed-down $1.75 trillion version the House passed in October. But Manchin, whose vote is crucial to pushing any legislation through the Senate via the reconciliation process, shot down the House bill in December. Only a simple majority of senators was needed to pass the bill via reconciliation. Since then, Democratic leaders had been negotiating with Manchin to see what he\u2019d be willing to support. The senator had repeatedly voiced concerns about the legislation\u2019s potential impact on inflation, which has skyrocketed over the past year. Economists, however, disagree about the actual extent of the legislation\u2019s effect on inflation. The latest version of the package, which Biden signed into law Tuesday, is projected to reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Medicare drug price negotiation: The legislation will empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors\u2019 offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary will negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number is set to rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. This controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it will open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs. Inflation cap: The legislation will also impose penalties on drug companies if they increase their prices faster than inflation, starting in 2023. However, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the provision could only apply to Medicare, not the private insurance market as well, as the Democrats had wanted. Limit on Medicare out-of-pocket drug costs: The law will redesign Medicare\u2019s Part D drug plans so that seniors and people with disabilities won\u2019t pay more than $2,000 a year for medications bought at the pharmacy, starting in 2025. Insurers and drugmakers will have to pick up more of the tab. Free vaccines for seniors: Medicare enrollees will be able to get all vaccines at no cost. Right now, only certain vaccines, such as those for Covid-19, the flu and pneumonia, are free. Altogether, the drug price provisions are expected to reduce the federal deficit by $288 billion over a decade, according to the CBO. Cheaper insulin: Medicare beneficiaries will pay no more than $35 a month for insulin, starting next year. Democrats had hoped to extend that provision to those covered by private insurance, but the parliamentarian decided that including the commercial market was not compliant with reconciliation rules. Democrats kept the broader provision in the package, but Republicans raised a point of order to force a vote that stripped the private insurance market from the measure. Affordable Care Act subsidies: The legislation will also extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way they won\u2019t expire just after the 2024 presidential election. The subsidies were expanded through this year as part of Democrats\u2019 $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, known as the American Rescue Plan, which was enacted in March 2021. They have made health care coverage on the Obamacare exchanges more affordable, leading to a record enrollment of 14.5 million people this year. Enrollees pay no more than 8.5% of their income toward coverage, down from nearly 10%. And lower-income policyholders receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums completely. Also, those earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level have become eligible for help for the first time. Those with incomes between 400% and 600% of the poverty level would face a doubling of premiums without the federal subsidies, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the federal Obamacare marketplace. Overall, the expanded assistance reduced premiums by 50%, or $67 per consumer per month, the agency said. If the enhanced federal assistance were allowed to expire at the end of the year, nearly all of the 13 million subsidized enrollees would see their premiums rise for 2023, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 3 million people could become uninsured, an Urban Institute analysis found. Democrats were hoping to avoid the negative publicity of such premium increases. If Congress didn\u2019t act, consumers would learn in the fall just how much more they could have to pay. Open enrollment begins on November 1, a week ahead of Election Day. Instead, CMS is projecting that even more people will flock to the Affordable Care Act exchanges now that the President has signed the bill. \u201cWe\u2019re really going to be able to build on our record enrollment and see an increase this year, this upcoming enrollment,\u201d CMS Administrator Chiquita Brooks-LaSure told CNN. \u201cThe only reason why we\u2019re having that conversation is because the subsidies have been extended.\u201d Extending the enhanced subsidies will cost $64 billion, according to the CBO. Climate provisions: The deal is the biggest climate investment in US history. It will slash US greenhouse gas emissions 40% by 2030, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s office said. The new agreement spans everything from electric vehicle tax credits to clean energy manufacturing to investments in environmental justice communities. Extending tax credits for electric vehicles made it in, after previous opposition from Manchin. The tax credits will continue at their current levels, up to $4,000 for a used electric vehicle and $7,500 for a new one. However, the income threshold for eligibility is lowered \u2013 a key demand of Manchin\u2019s. The law also contains 10-year consumer tax credits to bring down the cost of heat pumps, rooftop solar, electric HVAC and water heaters. It includes $60 billion of funding for environmental justice communities and for the reduction of legacy pollution. And it puts $60 billion towards domestic clean energy manufacturing and $30 billion for a production credit tax credit for wind, solar and battery storage. The legislation provides $4 billion in additional drought funding \u2013 a key negotiation point for Sinema amid the multi-year drought in the Southwest. The tax credits will be technology neutral \u2013 meaning they won\u2019t favor renewables over fossil fuels outfitted with carbon-reducing measures. However, they are designed to reward those who reduce their emissions the most, according to Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon. The deal also includes major provisions like a methane program that will levy a fee on oil and gas producers that emit methane above a certain threshold. It also includes $27 billion for a so-called clean energy accelerator \u2013 essentially a green bank that will leverage public and private funding to expand more green projects. Tax provisions: To boost revenue, the law imposes a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which will raise $258 billion over a decade, according to updated figures provided by Schumer, will apply to companies with profits over $1 billion. Concerned about how this provision would affect businesses, particularly manufacturers, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a moderate Democrat, won changes to the package that will allow companies to write off investments faster, which will reduce their tax burden. Sinema also nixed her party\u2019s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%. The provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers\u2019 profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats. In its place, a 1% excise tax on companies\u2019 stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to Schumer\u2019s office. The package also calls for providing more funding to the IRS for tax enforcement, which is expected to raise $124 billion. Democrats say families making less than $400,000 per year will not be affected, in line with a pledge by Biden. However, Republican lawmakers are seizing on a Joint Committee on Taxation report that shows that the measures will indirectly hit lower-income and middle-class Americans. Economists expect that employers will pass along a portion of the corporate tax to workers in the form of lower wages. Also, there will be no new taxes on small businesses. Manchin also threw cold water on one of Schumer\u2019s priorities \u2013 addressing the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, that was part of the GOP tax cut package in 2017 and affects many states in the Northeast and on the West Coast. The deal also leaves out tax surcharges on wealthy individuals, which was part of the House bill last year. Universal pre-K and lower child care costs: The earlier version of the House bill would have provided free pre-K for 3- and 4-year-olds, expanding access to 6 million children a year. It would have also limited child care costs for families with children younger than age 6 to no more than 7% of income for those earning up to 250% of the state median income, expanding access to about 20 million children. Funding for these programs would have lasted for six years, costing an estimated $381.5 billion, according to the CBO. Paid family and sick leave: Biden also called for a federally funded paid family and sick leave program for the millions of Americans who don\u2019t already receive the benefit from their employer. The previous House bill included four weeks of paid family and sick leave, which would have cost $205.5 billion, according to the CBO. Enhanced child tax credit: The beefed-up child tax credit \u2013 which provided $300 a month for each child under age 6 and $250 a month for each one ages 6 through 17 \u2013 would have been extended through 2022 for more than 35 million families under the House bill. The previous enhancement, which was part of the coronavirus relief package, was only in place for 2021. Heads of households earning up to $112,500 a year and joint filers making up to $150,000 annually would have qualified for the full enhanced credit. But, unlike in 2021, only these families would have received the funds in monthly installments this year. Eligible parents with higher incomes would have had to claim the credit on their tax return next year. The credit would have been made permanently refundable so the lowest income families would continue to qualify. This credit, along with the earned income tax credit, would have cost about $203 billion, according to the CBO. Earned income tax credit: The expanded earned income tax credit, which was also part of the coronavirus relief package, would have been extended through 2022 as well, helping 17 million low-wage childless workers. The previous House bill would have nearly tripled the maximum credit childless workers can receive, extended eligibility to more people, reduced the minimum age and eliminated the upper age limit. This credit, along with the enhanced child tax credit, would have cost about $203 billion, according to the CBO. Home health care: Biden\u2019s original plan called for permanently improving Medicaid coverage for home care services for seniors and people with disabilities, with the goal of reducing the more than 800,000 people on state Medicaid waiting lists. The plan also aimed to improve the quality of caregiving jobs. The measure would have cost nearly $158 billion, according to the CBO. Affordable housing: The legislation would have funneled $25 billion into the construction, rehabilitation or purchase of affordable homes for low-income people and for the creation and preservation of affordable rental housing. It would have provided $65 billion to address the capital needs backlog of public housing and would have bolstered rental assistance for hundreds of thousands of families. The measure would have also invested in down payment assistance and in community-led redevelopment projects in under-resourced neighborhoods. And it would have provided $24 billion to fund housing vouchers and supportive services. The effort would have cost about $148.1 billion, according to the CBO. Lowering the cost of college: The earlier House bill would have increased the maximum Pell grant by $550 for more than 5 million students enrolled in public and private nonprofit colleges and expanded access to undocumented students brought to the US as children, a group also known as Dreamers. It would have invested in historically Black colleges and universities and other institutions that serve underrepresented communities. And it would have increased funding for workforce development. These provisions would have cost a total of $39.8 billion, according to the CBO\u2019s estimate. Biden initially also called for making tuition free for two years at community colleges, but that provision was dropped from the House bill. Children\u2019s nutrition: The previous House bill would have expanded free school meals to nearly 9 million children during the school year and provided the parents of 29 million kids a monthly $65 per child benefit to purchase food during the summer. Congress recently passed a measure extending pandemic school meal waivers. Medicaid coverage gap: Democrats had called for providing Affordable Care Act premium subsidies for low-income Americans in the 12 states that have not expanded Medicaid, which would have enabled them to buy Obamacare policies with no monthly premiums, through 2025. Doing so would have cost about $57 billion, the CBO estimated. And the bill would have required state Medicaid programs to provide 12 months of eligibility to women after they give birth. States currently must provide at least 60 days of coverage. Medicare hearing benefits: Hearing services would have been covered under Medicare, starting in 2023, under the earlier bill that passed the House. Only 30% of seniors over age 70 who could benefit from hearing aids have ever used them, the White House said. This measure would have cost $36.7 billion, according to the CBO. Biden had initially also called for expanding Medicare to include vision and dental coverage. Extending Medicare solvency: Senate Democrats said in early July that they had finalized a deal to extend the solvency of Medicare by a few years by closing a tax loophole. The proposal would have ensured that owners of certain \u201cpass-through\u201d businesses, who include business income on their personal tax returns, would pay the 3.8% net investment income tax. It would have applied to individuals who earn more than $400,000 annually and to joint filers who earn more than $500,000. But that agreement was then also scuttled by Manchin. Medicare\u2019s hospital insurance trust fund will only be able to pay scheduled benefits until 2028, according to the most recent analysis by the program\u2019s trustees.

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Sen. Joe Manchin on Wednesday announced a deal on an energy and health care bill, representing a breakthrough after more than a year of negotiations that have collapsed time and again. But it will face furious GOP opposition. The deal is a major reversal for Manchin, and the health and climate bill stands a serious chance of becoming law as soon as August \u2013 assuming Democrats can pass the bill in the House and that it passes muster with the Senate parliamentarian to allow it to be approved along straight party lines in the budget process. While Manchin scuttled President Joe Biden\u2019s Build Back Better bill, the final deal includes a number of provisions the moderate from West Virginia had privately scoffed at, representing a significant reversal from earlier this month. That includes provisions addressing the climate crisis. What's in the Manchin-Schumer deal on climate, health care and taxes The agreement contains a number of Democrats\u2019 goals. While many details have not been disclosed, the measure would invest $369 billion into energy and climate change programs, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030, according to a one-page fact sheet. For the first time, Medicare would be empowered to negotiate the prices of certain medications, and it would cap out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 for those enrolled in Medicare drug plans. It would also extend expiring enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act coverage for three years. The announcement comes at a crucial time for Congress, as the Senate is a little over a week away from starting a monthlong recess, when many Democrats will campaign for reelection. The news also came several hours after the Senate passed a separate bill to invest $52 billion in US manufacturing of semiconductors, sending it to the House to consider as soon as this week. Notably, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell had previously vowed to try to halt passage of the semiconductor bill if Democrats continued to pursue their party-line bill on climate and drug prices. Manchin\u2019s support is notable given his stance earlier this month that he \u201cunequivocally\u201d wouldn\u2019t support the climate or tax provisions of the Democratic economic package, which appeared to torpedo any hope Democrats had of passing legislation to fight climate change in the near future. But Schumer and Manchin have been in revived talks since July 18 and locked down a deal Wednesday, according to a source familiar with the matter. Manchin had thrown cold water on doing tax and energy provisions as part of the deal, but ultimately agreed to it. The White House has signed off on this deal, Biden said in a statement. The deal still faces multiple hurdles before it can make it to Biden\u2019s desk, including the parliamentarian and having to pass both chambers of Congress, where practically any Democrat could sideline or delay passage. In a statement, Schumer\u2019s office said the bill would reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030. Clean energy tax credits would drive the majority of those emission reductions, a Democratic aide said. Two weeks ago, Schumer and Manchin were nearing a deal on $375 billion for the climate and energy provisions of the bill; the topline for climate announced tonight is $6 billion less than the original figure. Still, a senior Democratic aide told CNN they were happy with the $369 billion figure on spending for the climate and energy portion of the bill, saying it was more funding than was expected to come out of a deal. Tax credits for electric vehicles made it into the new deal, according to two Senate Democratic aides. Electric Vehicle tax credits will continue at their current levels, up to $4,000 for a used electric vehicle and $7,500 for a new EV. However, there will be a lower income threshold for people who can use the tax credits \u2013 a key demand of Manchin\u2019s. Manchin had been staunchly opposed to electric vehicle tax credits throughout negotiations. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota told CNN that she was presiding over the Senate Wednesday evening when Schumer called to tell her he had reached a deal with Manchin on a climate and energy bill. As Smith was presiding, her phone kept ringing off the hook with an unlisted number, which was Schumer calling. Finally, she answered it. \u201cI knew it was Chuck; I did the complete no-no and answered the phone,\u201d Smith told CNN. \u201cHe said \u201940% emissions reductions by 2030, this is a big F-ing deal!\u2019\u201d Smith, a Senate climate hawk, told CNN she was elated a deal had been reached after many ups and downs in negotiations with Manchin. She said the agreement was the \u201cmost significant action on climate and clean energy we\u2019ve ever taken.\u201d \u201cEverybody is very excited. I\u2019m stunned but in a good way,\u201d Smith said. Leaders of two prominent climate groups also told CNN the latest development was unexpected. \u201cThis is not what anyone was expecting, but we are so excited it\u2019s back on,\u201d Tiernan Sittenfeld, the senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, told CNN. \u201cObviously it\u2019s coming not a moment too soon as families struggle from the crazy heat across the world and country.\u201d Advocates were awaiting more details on the climate provisions, expected to be released on Wednesday evening. \u201cWe need to see the details of this deal, especially if there\u2019s permitting reform and development of fossil fuels,\u201d Evergreen Action co-founder Jamal Raad told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need to see in the coming days modeling on this legislation.\u201d But if the package does indeed achieve the emissions reductions Schumer is promising, Raad said it would be a hugely important step. \u201cIf this package does that in a bold way, this could put us on the path to reaching our goals and could be a huge win,\u201d he said. The deal keeps the prescription drug prices changes that Manchin had previously agreed to, including empowering Medicare to negotiate the price of certain costly medications administered in doctors\u2019 offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. It would also redesign Medicare\u2019s Part D drug plans so that seniors and people with disabilities wouldn\u2019t pay more than $2,000 a year for medication bought at the pharmacy. And, the deal would require drug companies to pay rebates if they increase their prices in the Medicare and private-insurance markets faster than inflation. Altogether, the drug price provisions would reduce the deficit by $288 billion over a decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The agreement also calls for extending the enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies for three years. An earlier deal would have continued the beefed-up subsidies for two years, which meant they would have expired just after the 2024 presidential election \u2013 a scenario that congressional Democrats did not want to encounter. The subsidies were expanded through this year as part of Democrats\u2019 $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, known as the American Rescue Plan, which was enacted in March 2021. They have made health care coverage on the Obamacare exchanges more affordable, leading to record enrollment this year. Enrollees pay no more than 8.5% of their income toward coverage, down from nearly 10%. And lower-income policyholders receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums completely. Also, those earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level have become eligible for help for the first time. Extending the enhanced subsidies would cost $64 billion over a decade, according to the CBO. To raise revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on corporations, which would raise $313 billion over a decade. While details on the current deal remain scant, the House version of the Build Back Better package would have levied the tax on the corporate profits that large companies report to shareholders, not to the Internal Revenue Service. It would have applied to companies with more than $1 billion in profits and yielded a similar revenue-raising figure. The current deal also aims to close the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%. Eliminating this loophole, which would raise $14 billion over a decade, has been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats. The package also calls for providing more funding to the IRS for tax enforcement, which would raise $124 billion. Democrats say families making less than $400,000 per year would not be affected, in line with a pledge by Biden. Also, there would be no new taxes on small businesses. Manchin said in a statement that the deal would ensure \u201cthat large corporations and the ultra-wealthy pay their fair share in taxes,\u201d though it doesn\u2019t contain the tax rate hikes on rich Americans and big companies that Democrats initially wanted to include in the budget reconciliation packages before they were shot down by Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Notably, Manchin also threw cold water on one of Schumer\u2019s priorities \u2013 addressing the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT, that was part of the GOP tax cut package in 2017 and affects many states in the Northeast and on the West Coast. Many details of the current deal remain to be worked out, which could delay or scuttle it, said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. In total, Democrats say the deal would reduce the deficit by more than $300 billion. \u201cRather than risking more inflation with trillions in new spending, this bill will cut the inflation taxes Americans are paying, lower the cost of health insurance and prescription drugs, and ensure our country invests in the energy security and climate change solutions we need to remain a global superpower through innovation rather than elimination,\u201d Manchin said in his own statement Wednesday afternoon.

            "article_content": "Wes Moore, a leading Democratic candidate for governor of Maryland, first became famous for his 2010 bestselling memoir, \u201cThe Other Wes Moore,\u201d an inspirational story of two boys with the same name and ties to the rough streets of Baltimore. While the author became a Rhodes scholar, an Army captain and a White House fellow, the other Wes Moore was convicted of killing a police officer in 2000 and is serving a life sentence in prison. The book is required reading in many schools in Maryland and across the country, and it fixed Moore in the minds of many as a proud son of Baltimore. It also helped launch his successful career in media and philanthropy. Moore has since written more books, hosted his own TV show on the Oprah Winfrey Network and spent four years as CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, New York City\u2019s largest anti-poverty non-profit. Now Moore is seen as a potential up-and-comer in Democratic politics. He\u2019s one of the leading primary candidates in a state where the party\u2019s nominee would be heavily favored to win the governor\u2019s race \u2013 and, potentially, to rise as a national political figure. But as he\u2019s entered politics, Moore\u2019s story has come in for a closer examination. While his book lays out the basic details of his life factually, a less accurate version of his Baltimore roots has taken on a life of its own, fueled by more than a decade of assertions by other people in TV interviews that he is a Baltimore native, born and raised in the city. Obama returns to the White House for the first time as Democrats look ahead to midterm elections At times, Moore has fed that impression himself. For example, he has repeatedly said that he originally wanted to call his first book \u201cBaltimore Sons.\u201d Other times, he made ambiguous statements about his childhood connections to Baltimore or, in high-profile settings, sat by quietly as others repeated erroneous details. Now Moore\u2019s story has become the subject of conversation in the race. His campaign last week sent a letter to the Maryland state prosecutor and the state board of elections, alleging that \u201cfalse and disparaging information\u201d had been spread about Moore in \u201can orchestrated attempt\u201d to disparage him. The letter goes on to allege that \u201ca rival campaign may be responsible for this smear campaign.\u201d The same week, the campaign launched a website, FactsMD.com about Moore\u2019s childhood and connections to Baltimore. In checking out those facts, CNN reviewed dozens of Moore\u2019s public appearances and writings of the past 12 years, as well as other records. What that effort reveals is a complicated story of race, identity and the responsibility of public figures to control their own narrative. According to Moore\u2019s website, he wasn\u2019t born in Baltimore but in Washington, DC. As the book lays out, he spent his early childhood in the suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland, some 30 miles from Baltimore. After his father\u2019s sudden death when Moore was 3 years old, he then moved with his family to the Bronx, which at the time was beset by crime, drugs and poverty \u2013 much as Baltimore was in the 1980s and 1990s. Late in the summer before he turned 16, Moore\u2019s mother moved to the middle-class enclave of Pasadena, in Maryland\u2019s Anne Arundel County. But by then Moore was away at military school in Pennsylvania. Moore\u2019s campaign says that when he would visit his mother as a kid, he would often go roller-skating and get his hair cut in Baltimore. It wasn\u2019t until he was a 20-year-old undergraduate student at Johns Hopkins University that Moore first lived in Baltimore. Even then, as a student at Johns Hopkins, the world he inhabited while attending a prestigious private university was nothing like the notorious inner-city housing developments of Baltimore where the 2010 book says the other Wes Moore grew up. Though Moore\u2019s book never explicitly asserts he was born in Baltimore, it does allude prominently to his strong association with the city. The book opens with the line, \u201cThis is the story of two boys living in Baltimore with similar histories and an identical name.\u201d Later in the same introduction, Moore writes, \u201cWe\u2019d grown up at the same time, on the same streets, with the same name.\u201d More than one interviewer referred to Moore as born in Baltimore, including Winfrey. A spokesperson for Winfrey told CNN the producers of their 2016 interview had relied on information in the published memoir in crafting her introduction. Now that the campaign is underway, those closest to Moore describe a genuine connection to Baltimore, where he has lived for about the last decade. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anyone connect to a place more than Wes did when he fell in love with Baltimore,\u201d his mother, Joy Moore, said in a statement provided to CNN by the Moore campaign. \u201cMy job was in Baltimore City, and I couldn\u2019t keep him out of the city when he was home from military school as a teenager.\u201d \u201cBaltimore is where Wes came of age,\u201d she said, \u201cand he has built and fostered a community in Baltimore for over 25 years since he was 15 years old.\u201d In response to questions from CNN, the Moore campaign declined to make the candidate available for an interview and directed CNN instead to answers provided on the FactsMD.com website. \u201cThis attempt to put Wes Moore\u2019s childhood trauma under a microscope neatly aligns with blatant dog whistles and other mischaracterizations of Wes\u2019 childhood that have been circulating for months and that are now the subject of a criminal investigation by the State Prosecutor\u2019s Office,\u201d a Moore campaign spokesperson said in a written statement to CNN. Contacted by CNN, the state prosecutor declined to comment. Asked about the Moore campaign\u2019s complaint letter, Maryland Board of Elections director of candidacy Jared DeMarinis said, \u201cWe review every complaint, and this is no different from any other complaint we receive in the course of an election.\u201d The question of where Moore grew up has been complicated by more than a decade of public promotion and hype that has surrounded his up-from-the-streets story. Within weeks of the 2010 publication of Moore\u2019s first book, he was on The \u202fNew York Times\u202fnonfiction bestseller list and on a high-profile media book tour that took him through, among others, \u201cThe View,\u201d \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d Moore didn\u2019t object when others asserted that he and the other Wes Moore were from the same part of Baltimore. In a May 2010 PBS interview, Moore walked under umbrellas in the rain with Judy Woodruff, telling her, \u201cThese were areas that we knew. These were blocks that we knew.\u201d They passed the intersection of Kennedy Avenue and The Alameda, which is about 25 miles from Moore\u2019s mother\u2019s house in Pasadena, and 1.8 miles from the Hopkins campus. Woodruff introduced him as \u201cBaltimore native Wes Moore,\u201d speaking from the studio to introduce the piece before cutting to footage of them walking down the street together in Baltimore. Republicans hammer Democrats on inflation in midterms advertising Asked about the segment, Woodruff told CNN she\u2019d found the copy of \u201cThe Other Wes Moore\u201d that she\u2019d read ahead of the interview and had cited lines like that first sentence, \u201cThis is the story of two boys from Baltimore with similar histories and an identical name,\u201d and a headline that is included from The Baltimore Sun, \u201cLocal Graduate Named Rhodes Scholar.\u201d (Though not identified as such in the book, the article had run on the front page of the paper\u2019s Anne Arundel County section in December 2000.) Many of Moore\u2019s interviews featured the same anecdote of how he had first learned about the other Wes Moore: It was his junior year of college and he was studying abroad in South Africa when his mother called with surprising news. \u201c\u2018There are wanted posters all over your neighborhood for Wes Moore, for the murder of a police officer,\u2019\u201d he said she had told him. \u201cYou were haunted by the fact that a guy with your name, grew up in the same neighborhood, a couple of blocks away, a lot of similarities, but you end up working in the White House, and he ends up in jail,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough responded, as Moore listened contentedly, making no correction. A month and a half later, on his old Comedy Central show, Stephen Colbert stopped Moore at one point in his storytelling. \u201cThis is your neighborhood back home?\u201d\u202fColbert asked. \u201cYeah. This is the same neighborhood,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWhere was this neighborhood?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cIt was in Baltimore,\u201d Moore said. The Moore campaign declined to answer CNN\u2019s questions about television appearances. The runaway success of \u201cThe Other Wes Moore\u201d launched Moore into an elite circuit of influence and paid appearances. He was a regular panelist on \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time with Bill Maher.\u201d He was invited to give commencement speeches and was popular on the paid speaker circuit off a bio that introduced him as \u201craised in Baltimore.\u201d During the Obama administration, Moore was invited to the White House several times, and he received an Obama presidential appointment to a community service board. By 2016, Moore was walking arm in arm with Winfrey in a video for her \u201cSuper Soul Sunday\u201d series, talking about his second book, \u201cThe Work.\u201d Winfrey introduces the segment with a series of voice-overs. \u201cBorn in Baltimore in 1978,\u201d she starts. \u201cHe discovered there was another young man, also named Wes Moore, who grew up just blocks away from his own childhood home,\u201d she says a few seconds later. The next year Moore got a high-profile job in philanthropy. In April 2017, he was named CEO of the Robin Hood Foundation, a non-profit that raises hundreds of millions from New York\u2019s investment bankers and hedge funders. Robin Hood sees itself as essentially New York\u2019s community foundation, with all of its programming locally based. People familiar with the search process told CNN that Moore\u2019s roots in the Bronx had helped land him the job. Indeed, the Robin Hood news release announcing his hiring notes that \u201che spent much of his childhood in the Bronx.\u201d There\u2019s no mention of being from Baltimore at all. Soon, in the official bios Moore was sending around as CEO for appearances from Princeton\u2019s department of African American studies to the BlackRock investment firm, that shifted again: \u201cWes grew up in Baltimore and the Bronx,\u201d it reads. When news started spreading in the winter of 2021 that Moore was considering a run for governor, a February 2021 Baltimore Sun headline read, \u201cBaltimore-born author and educator Wes Moore considering running for Maryland governor.\u201d Moore left the Robin Hood Foundation last spring and announced his campaign for governor a few weeks later. As he prepared to launch a political career, there are signs that efforts were made to correct the record.\u202fLast June, three days before he entered the race, Moore\u2019s personal website was edited, with changes removing a reference to \u201cback home in Baltimore.\u201d\u202fThat same day, a Wikipedia user changed Moore\u2019s listed birthplace from Baltimore to Takoma Park, citing the change back to his personal website. In his campaign launch video, a young actor plays Moore as a boy, at an age when he was living in the Bronx. Though the street featured in the shoot is not identified, the scene immediately cuts to the Baltimore skyline. In the months since announcing his candidacy, Moore has gained traction despite competing in a crowded primary field. On April 2, Moore overwhelmingly won the backing of the state teachers\u2019 union, a major endorsement in the race. In his speech to members, he talked about how many classes he\u2019d been to with students who had read his book and connected with his story. The Baltimore public school system placed an order for 4,600 copies of \u201cThe Other Wes Moore\u201d in 2020 alone. Among the defenses the Moore campaign includes on its FactsMD website is that Moore asked his publisher, Random House, for a correction ahead of the book\u2019s publication and again as he was preparing his campaign. \u201cSome versions of the book synopsis of THE OTHER WES MOORE inaccurately identified Wes Moore as born in Baltimore. Flagged by the author at the time, a correction to the copy was missed upon its initial publication,\u201d a statement attributed to Random House on the website states. \u201cWhen notified again of the error early last year, Random House corrected all subsequent print runs of the book.\u201d The publisher confirmed that statement but did not answer follow-up questions from CNN about it. In his second book, \u201cThe Work,\u201d published in 2015, Moore also referred to spending nights in Baltimore as a child. \u201cAs a kid in Baltimore and the Bronx during the homicidal height of the so-called crack era, I would lie in bed on some nights and listen to the pop of low-caliber guns somewhere beyond my window,\u201d he wrote. The Moore campaign declined to discuss specific questions about this memory or to make Moore available to talk about it. Just a few months before launching his campaign, in a video chat with members of his old college back at Oxford in January 2021, Moore sat quietly as two different professors introduced him by mentioning his Baltimore roots, one by saying, \u201cborn in Baltimore, well-known by anyone who\u2019s seen \u2018The Wire.\u2019 \u201c For some in Baltimore, it\u2019s OK for suburban residents to claim the city as home. Carl Stokes, a former Baltimore city council member, said he had met Moore two decades ago after a college professor introduced them. They met for lunch at the Hopkins Club on campus, Stokes said, and Moore talked about his connections to the wider area back then. \u201cIt\u2019s close enough that I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that unusual to say they\u2019re from the next big place,\u201d said Stokes, who is now supporting state comptroller Peter Franchot in the governor\u2019s race. \u201cIf you dig deeper, they\u2019ll say, \u2018Actually, I was out from the suburbs,\u2019 \u201d he said. But other residents see it differently. Hassan Giordano, a Baltimore native and Democratic political media consultant who is not backing a candidate in the governor\u2019s race, said he\u2019s known Moore for a decade and that he\u2019s impressed with Moore\u2019s other qualifications. But he called the account of Baltimore roots \u201creally disingenuous.\u201d Asked by CNN if he\u2019d consider the time Moore cites during his teen summers as \u201ccoming of age\u201d in Baltimore, Giordano said, \u201cHell, no.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not growing up in Baltimore, that\u2019s visiting Baltimore. That\u2019s being here for the summer,\u201d Giordano told CNN. \u201cI think that most people from Baltimore would tell you that it gets under their skin to hear someone say that they\u2019re from Baltimore, even if they\u2019re from Baltimore County or the Baltimore area,\u201d Giordano said. Munir Bahar, a longtime community activist in Baltimore who told CNN he doesn\u2019t have a favored candidate in the governor\u2019s race, said that when he had first met Moore after the 2015 riots following the death of Freddie Gray, he had thought the candidate was from the city. When told by CNN that Moore\u2019s campaign describes him as being raised in Baltimore based on his summers visiting from Pasadena, Bahar said, \u201cThat\u2019s definitely not being raised in Baltimore. That\u2019s not the Baltimore experience,\u201d adding, \u201cAs a young Black boy growing up in Baltimore, you can\u2019t use that as a platform unless it\u2019s really authentic, especially in the \u201990s and 2000s. Everybody wants to use Baltimore as a backdrop.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The headlines seem very simple: Violent crime is on the rise. There was a 5% increase in homicides in 2021 compared with 2020 and a 44% increase compared with 2019, according to an analysis of 22 US cities by the Council on Criminal Justice. A separate CNN analysis of police department data also found an increase in 2021: \u201cMore than two-thirds of the country\u2019s 40 most populous cities saw more homicides last year than in 2020 \u2026 Ten of those cities recorded more homicides in 2021 than any other year on record.\u201d The rising homicide rate will feed into a national narrative of rising crime that has included recent outbreaks of police shootings and carjackings. Crime, however, is a very local issue, as the CCJ data makes clear. Some cities saw murder rates rise in 2021, such as: Other cities saw their murder rates fall, such as: Despite the recent rise, homicide rates are still far below their levels in the 1980s and early 1990s. Congresswoman\u2019s car struck by gunfire. Anecdotally, there is evidence of violence reaching every type of American \u2013 including elected officials. In a statement on Twitter, Democratic Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri acknowledged her vehicle was struck by gunfire in the St. Louis area. Bush, who has been a leader in the effort to spend less money on policing and more on social services, talked about a holistic approach to addressing violence. She was not in the car and noted no one was harmed, but that \u201cany act of gun violence shakes your soul.\u201d She added: \u201cThat\u2019s why our movement is working to invest in our communities, eradicate the root causes of gun violence, and keep everyone safe.\u201d Focusing on violence and police reform. Many US cities are in a very different place politically than they were two years ago, after the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota led to calls for police reform at the national level. An effort to enact nationwide policing reform, named for Floyd, stalled in Congress. Today, there is much more focus on crime rates and gun violence. A top Justice Department official, Lisa Monaco, told CNN\u2019s Evan Perez and Tierney Sneed the Biden administration will still move to address both safety and policing. \u201cThis is not an either/or,\u201d Monaco told CNN in an exclusive interview Tuesday. \u201cWe have got to do both.\u201d Perez and Sneed wrote: \u201cThe department, under President Joe Biden, has doubled down on investigations into allegations of discriminatory policing after the Trump administration scaled back that work. But the Biden administration has also bolstered the resources the department\u2019s offered law enforcement, with the department making $1.6 billion in grants available last year for policing programs aimed at reducing violent crime.\u201d Politics of crime and violence. Republicans are likely to say there\u2019s a crime problem. Democrats are likely to say there\u2019s a gun problem. Regardless, a surge in violent incidents is fast becoming a major political issue, particularly when Democrats are already in danger of losing their House majority in the November midterm elections. There is also cause for concern about a very specific kind of crime that drives politics: attacks on police. CNN\u2019s Emma Tucker and Priya Krishnakumar wrote: \u201cAccording to preliminary year-end data provided to CNN by the FBI, 73 officers died in felonious killings in the line of duty in 2021. The year marks the highest total recorded by the agency since 1995, excluding the 9/11 attacks.\u201d Shootings are far from the top cause of death among police officers \u2013 336 line-of-duty police officers died from Covid-19 in 2021, according to the story. Where violence happens. There is a tendency to focus on murder rates in large US cities, like New York, Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, DC. That misses a key element of the murder rate story, which has to do with guns. A study published last week by the nonprofit group Everytown for Gun Safety found a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings. The organization, which advocates for stronger gun laws, gave a score to states based on their gun laws and compared those scores with the rate of gun deaths in 2020, using data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Mississippi had the weakest gun laws, according to the group\u2019s scoring, and the highest rate of gun deaths per 100,000 residents. Massachusetts has some of the nation\u2019s toughest gun laws and the second-lowest rate of gun deaths. See maps of the two sets of data. On the ground in Jackson. CNN\u2019s Krishnakumar and Peter Nickeas documented the toll of the gun violence problem in Jackson, Mississippi, at the end of 2021. It\u2019s a city, and a state, where the homicide rate is far above the rest of the country. Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba took them around the city. \u201cWe see lifelong friends kill each other, we\u2019ve seen a son kill his mother and sister, have seen crimes that are based on social determinants and an inability of people to be engaged in institutions in which they thrive,\u201d he said. The New York situation. Violence is also among the top issues facing New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a Democrat. He\u2019s a former cop who promised to make the city safer, and weeks into the job, is facing high-profile violence \u2013 including a woman who was shoved off a subway platform, an officer killed in the line of duty and a baby shot in the Bronx. CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg told me via email these crimes are impossible to ignore, especially if you read the tabloids, where they\u2019ve dominated the headlines: Not to focus too heavily on \u201cvibes,\u201d here, but there\u2019s also a really pervasive tension in the city. Fewer people are around because of office closures, which is an economic dud and has the effect of making folks feel less safe. Add to that a general sense of gloom and exhaustion over Covid \u2013 Omicron is receding, but it\u2019s been a real blow to a city that was starting to get its feet back \u2013 and uncertainty over the present and future are palpable. A rash of violent, apparently random crime spices up an already nasty brew. People look to the police and mayors to protect them. In New York, mayors get very little patience from the public. A key element of Adams\u2019 plan to cut down on crime is to reinstate a controversial plainclothes officer unit. More from Krieg: The political dynamic to all this is that Adams\u2019s signature thing \u2014 his only thing, many would argue \u2014 was a promise to restore both a reality and perception of public safety. He often calls it \u201cthe prerequisite to prosperity,\u201d a way of marrying his law and order pitch with an economic one. But now he\u2019s in the soup because, even though it\u2019s only been 3.5 weeks, that core promise is on the line. And no single human, or mayor, can totally change the fundamentals of whatever\u2019s causing what\u2019s going on here. (The irony here being, of course, that his I Alone Can Fix It message during primary has put him in this corner\u2026 and even a visit from President Biden and the love of national Democrats won\u2019t save him if his \u201cblueprint\u201d to stop the violence doesn\u2019t deliver immediate results.) A warning on Philadelphia. Former Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican, wrote for CNN that Democrats in Philadelphia and the rest of Pennsylvania must focus on safety as a key issue. He rattled off a string of incidents involving his own family members encountering violence. Dent argued that unsafe neighborhoods are tied to economic issues, which can be exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWhat\u2019s worse than the political costs are the impacts on the lives of our fellow citizens who fear for their safety in their homes and neighborhoods. Crime drives residents who can afford to leave their homes, leaving behind more vulnerable people with more limited incomes. Poverty becomes more pervasive as disinvestment saps the strength of those left behind.\u201d Meanwhile, the top Republican in the House, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, told a gathering at the US Conference of Mayors recently that safety is always key to elections, and it will be in 2022. \u201cCrime is going to be probably the biggest issue in any election,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter, you want to feel safe, and it doesn\u2019t matter what part of the city you are in. And this is really the core: You\u2019ve got to feel safe. Your children have to feel safe.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In 2009, Senate Democrats spent months courting Republican Charles Grassley in search of bipartisan support for the Affordable Care Act. By that September, President Barack Obama had lost patience. \u201cLet me ask you a question, Chuck,\u201d Obama said in an Oval Office meeting he recounted in his 2020 memoir. \u201cAre there any changes \u2013 any at all \u2013 that would get us your vote?\u201d \u201cI guess not, Mr. President,\u201d Grassley replied, concluding negotiations. Is Sen. Joe Manchin now reprising Grassley\u2019s role on President Joe Biden\u2019s Build Back Better plan? If so \u2013 if nothing can ultimately get the West Virginia Democrat to \u201cyes\u201d \u2013 then more wheedling represents a waste of time. The legislation cannot pass without him. But the White House and party leaders, believing they cannot afford to fail, maintain hope that Manchin\u2019s vote can be won. That means exploring ways to reshape Biden\u2019s plan to meet the senator\u2019s objections. How months of talks between Biden and Manchin over Build Back Better broke down In theory, that shouldn\u2019t be so hard. Like the President, Manchin agrees an acceptable package could spend $1.75 trillion over 10 years. Before his bombshell pre-Christmas announcement of opposition to the House-passed version of the massive tax and spending bill that would expand the nation\u2019s social safety net, he had handed Biden a $1.8 trillion version. That\u2019s roughly half the President\u2019s original proposal, but other congressional Democrats have made clear they can accept that reduction. The challenge is determining how to spend it. As they whittled the price tag last year, House Democrats decided against culling many programs from Build Back Better. Instead, they financed them for only part of the 10-year span used in budget legislation, figuring a later Congress wouldn\u2019t let the money run out. Manchin complains that \u201cgimmick\u201d obscures the plan\u2019s true long-term cost. He\u2019d rather discard some proposals and fully fund those that remain. That would inflict pain on Democratic union and social service constituencies that yearn for more money. Yet $1.75 trillion could still finance major priorities Democrats appear to agree on. Championing his coal-producing state, Manchin slams as unduly punitive some Build Back Better proposals to ameliorate climate change. But he insists he supports most of the bill\u2019s climate provisions. Overall, they cost $550 billion. Manchin also backs new subsidies to help parents obtain child care and prekindergarten education for 3- and 4-year-olds. Permanent funding for those parts of Build Back Better, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, takes $752 billion. Nor has Manchin objected to more financial help for Americans seeking health insurance under the Affordable Care Act (which Congress finally enacted in March 2010 without Grassley\u2019s support). Permanent funding for those Build Back Better provisions, CBO says, would cost $428 billion. A bill with those elements \u2013 on climate change, child care, prekindergarten and Obamacare \u2013 would represent a major advance for Democratic priorities. And the cumulative $1.73 trillion cost would fit Manchin\u2019s compromise budget. 'I'm kind of speechless': Democrats scramble to salvage climate provisions after Manchin sinks Build Back Better Of course, that list omits hundreds of billions\u2019 worth of other Biden proposals, including money to expand the housing supply, raise home health care workers\u2019 pay, add hearing benefits under Medicare and augment the Earned Income Tax Credit for childless adults. More politically precarious, it also omits the Build Back Better provision many Democrats value most: an expanded Child Tax Credit that analysts say reduces childhood poverty by 40%. Manchin says too much of the money \u2013 more than $1 trillion over 10 years if funded permanently \u2013 would be squandered by undeserving recipients. Yet just a tiny fraction of that investment would deliver much of the benefit Democrats seek. For $50 billion over 10 years, the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities projects, Congress could cut child poverty 20% without even increasing the maximum Child Tax Credit that this administration inherited from President Donald Trump. The reduction would come from making the pre-Biden credit \u201cfully refundable\u201d \u2013 available even to parents who don\u2019t earn enough to generate federal income tax liabilities. That\u2019s something Manchin does oppose, insisting it gives some parents without jobs money to spend on drugs rather than their children. But if fellow Democrats could persuade him to compromise, adding Child Tax Credit refundability would partially address their priority while leaving the cost of a revised Biden plan below $1.8 trillion. 10 things you didn't know are in the Democrats' Build Back Better bill Manchin also fears Build Back Better spending would expand the budget deficit and exacerbate inflation. But deficit hawks at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget say Biden has specified more than $2 trillion in bona fide financing sources, while economists in both parties envision the bill having a negligible inflationary impact. In other words, a hypothetical package along these lines would seem to meet Manchin\u2019s concerns. The question is whether his stated objections can be taken at face value. In the 2020 election, Trump defeated Biden in West Virginia by 39 percentage points \u2013 a larger margin than anywhere except Wyoming. With a coal-loving constituency like that, perhaps Manchin \u2013 like Grassley on Obama\u2019s health care plan \u2013 simply cannot bring himself to push Biden\u2019s economic and climate agenda over the finish line. That did not, however, stop him from joining the party-line vote to pass Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan last March. The next few weeks will tell whether the White House and Democratic leaders can make it happen again.",

            "article_content": "Drew Griffin, CNN\u2019s award-winning Senior Investigative Correspondent, known for getting even the cagiest of interview subjects to engage in a story, died Saturday after a long battle with cancer, his family said. He was 60. A gifted storyteller, Griffin had a well-earned reputation for holding powerful people and institutions accountable. \u201cDrew\u2019s death is a devastating loss to CNN and our entire profession,\u201d CNN CEO Chris Licht said in a note to staff. \u201cA highly acclaimed investigative journalist, Drew\u2019s work had incredible impact and embodied the mission of this organization in every way.\u201d Griffin worked on hundreds of stories and multiple documentaries over the course of nearly two decades on CNN\u2019s investigative team. His reporting had been honored with some of\u202fjournalism\u2019s most prestigious awards \u2013 Emmys, Peabodys, and Murrows among them. \u201cBut people mattered more to Drew than prizes,\u201d Licht said. Griffin had an incredibly strong work ethic, colleagues said. He kept his illness private from most of his co-workers and had been reporting up until the day he passed. Michael Bass, CNN\u2019s Executive Vice President of Programming, also shared his admiration for Griffin in a note to the investigative team Sunday. \u201cFearless and artful at the same time, he knew how to push a story forward to its limits, but also tell it in a way that would make everyone understand,\u201d Bass said. \u201cHow many times has he chased an unwilling interviewee? How many times has he spoken truth to power? How many times has he made a difference on something important \u2026 It was an honor to be his colleague and to be witness to his work and the ways it changed the world.\u201d Griffin\u2019s reporting had significant impact and prompted change. He led a yearlong investigation that uncovered delays in medical care that contributed to patient deaths at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals nationwide. The team\u2019s reporting led to the resignation of the VA secretary, which was followed by the passage of federal legislation and a fundamental change in how veterans\u2019 appointments are handled. Amid his reporting into the high number of sexual assaults allegations against Uber drivers, the company changed its background check process and introduced new safety features in its app. Following the CNN investigation, Uber announced it would do away with a policy that previously forced individuals with sexual assault complaints into arbitration and made them sign non-disclosure agreements. Patricia DiCarlo, Executive Producer of CNN\u2019s investigative unit who worked alongside Griffin for nearly a decade said Griffin was an exceptional writer who crafted pieces into \u201ccompelling, must-see TV stories.\u201d \u201cYou know when a Drew Griffin story starts \u2013 it\u2019s going to be great,\u201d she said. \u201cHis way with words set him apart.\u201d Griffin\u2019s tenacious approach toward the most challenging stories and his ability to get some of the most reluctant public figures to open up and give their side of the story underscored his sense of fairness. Still, he never missed an opportunity to grill them with tough questions. Griffin\u2019s incisive, Emmy-award winning investigation into fraud claims against Trump University in 2016 exposed the questionable, financially draining tactics of a series of real estate seminars that resulted in class action lawsuits by participants. In an exclusive interview, Griffin pressed a former Trump University instructor about his role in the scheme \u2013 not teaching real estate strategies, but luring participants into paying for more seminars: \u201cWe were bringing in the money,\u201d he told Griffin. When election denialism persisted, Griffin worked to dispel the myths of widespread election fraud, confronting one of the biggest names in misinformation: MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. After reviewing the so-called evidence, Griffin sat down with Lindell for a lengthy interview to evaluate his claims and, ultimately, laid out the truth: Lindell had \u201cproof of nothing.\u201d There were times, though, when Griffin, like all reporters, could not get his subjects to talk right away \u2013 resulting in memorable on-camera confrontations with government officials, in particular. When Griffin learned of the rampant fraud in California\u2019s state drug rehab program in 2013, he pressed the officials in charge for answers. He finally tracked down the head of California\u2019s Health and Human Services Agency, who tried dodging Griffin\u2019s questions by running to a restroom, which was locked. Griffin\u2019s investigation resulted in a legislative probe and a public apology from the director of the program. More recently, Griffin\u2019s body of work in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol exposed the dangers of election deniers and was cited in court filings by the Department of Justice and House select committee investigating the insurrection. While investigative journalism was at the heart of Griffin\u2019s work, he often jumped into breaking news coverage \u2013 from mass shootings to devastating hurricanes. Among his more memorable on-air moments was during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, when he rescued a man by pulling him from a sinking pickup truck. Griffin\u2019s confidence, hard work and doggedness spoke for itself on camera, yet it was his graciousness and compassion that defined him behind the scenes. Few in the audience would know that after those hard-hitting interviews, Griffin would often craft hand-written thank you notes to those who appeared in a story. And, while intensely private, Griffin took great care to wrap up the big stories \u2013 some of which swept him across the world \u2013 so he could get home and spend time with his family. Colleagues remembered the veteran journalist as a kind, consummate professional who took the time to mentor younger reporters, cared deeply about his team \u2013 and was always ready to lend a hand. DiCarlo compared her time working with Griffin to \u201cwinning the career lottery.\u201d \u201cThere are just so many people who worked with him and loved him \u2013 this is a devastating loss,\u201d DiCarlo said, reflecting on the team of producers who closely worked with Griffin on his stories. \u201cThere was no one else like him. We were Team Drew.\u201d A Chicago native, Griffin began his reporting career as a reporter/cameraman for WICD-TV in Champaign, Illinois. He spent stints working for TV stations in Florida, South Carolina, North Carolina and Washington. He became an investigative reporter when he joined KIRO-TV in Seattle. He joined CBS 2 News in Los Angeles in January 1994, where he worked as a reporter and anchor and helped create the station\u2019s investigative reporting team and won multiple local awards. When he wasn\u2019t chasing his next scoop, family members said he loved to travel with his wife Margot, play the trumpet or enjoy a round of golf with friends. He also doted over his three children whose names were inspired by jazz greats \u2013 daughter, Ele Gast; sons, Louis and Miles Griffin \u2013 and two grandchildren.",

            "article_content": "Nelly Cheboi, who in 2019 quit a lucrative software engineering job in Chicago to create computer labs for Kenyan schoolchildren, is the 2022 CNN Hero of the Year. Inside 2022's 'CNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute' Online voters selected her from among this year\u2019s Top 10 CNN Heroes. Cheboi\u2019s nonprofit, TechLit Africa, has provided thousands of students across rural Kenya with access to donated, upcycled computers \u2014 and the chance at a brighter future. Cheboi accepted the award with her mother, who she said \u201cworked really hard to educate us.\u201d At the beginning of her acceptance speech, Cheboi and her mother sang a song onstage  that she explained had a special meaning when she was growing up. As CNN Hero of the Year, Cheboi will receive $100,000 to expand her work. She and the other top 10 CNN Heroes honored at Sunday\u2019s gala all receive a $10,000 cash award and, for the first time, additional grants, organizational training and support from The Elevate Prize Foundation through a new collaboration with CNN Heroes. Nelly will also be named an Elevate Prize winner, which comes with a $300,000 grant and additional support worth $200,000 for her nonprofit. Cheboi grew up in poverty in Mogotio, a rural township in Kenya. \u201cI know the pain of poverty,\u201d said Cheboi, 29. \u201cI never forgot what it was like with my stomach churning because of hunger at night.\u201d A hard-working student, Cheboi received a full scholarship to Augustana College in Illinois in 2012. She began her studies there with almost no experience with computers, handwriting papers and struggling to transcribe them onto a laptop. This CNN Hero upcycles old computers to open new worlds for young Kenyans Everything changed in her junior year, though, when Cheboi took a programming course required for her mathematics major. \u201cWhen I discovered computer science, I just fell in love with it. I knew that this is something that I wanted to do as my career, and also bring it to my community,\u201d she told CNN. Many basic computer skills were still a steep learning curve, however. Cheboi remembers having to practice touch-typing for six months before she could pass a coding interview. Touch-typing is a skill that is now a core part of the TechLit curriculum. \u201cI feel so accomplished seeing kids that are 7 years old touch-typing, knowing that I just learned how to touch-type less than five years ago,\u201d she said. Once she had begun working in the software industry, Cheboi soon realized the extent of which  computers were being thrown away as companies upgraded their technology infrastructure. Watch Sofia Carson perform 'Applause' at CNN Heroes celebration \u201cWe have kids here (in Kenya) \u2014 myself included, back in the day \u2014 who don\u2019t even know what a computer is,\u201d she said. So, in 2018, she began transporting donated computers back to Kenya \u2014 in her personal luggage, handling customs fees and taxes herself. \u201cAt one point, I was bringing 44 computers, and I paid more for the luggage than I did for the air ticket,\u201d she said. A year later, she co-founded TechLit Africa with a fellow software engineer after both quit their jobs. The nonprofit accepts computer donations from companies, universities and individuals. The hardware is wiped and refurbished before it\u2019s shipped to Kenya. There, it\u2019s distributed to partner schools in rural communities, where students ages 4 to 12 receive daily classes and frequent opportunities to learn from professionals, gaining skills that will help improve their education and better prepare them for future jobs. \u201cWe have people who own a specific skill coming in and are just inspiring the kids (with) music production, video production, coding, personal branding,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThey can go from doing a remote class with NASA on education to music production.\u201d The organization currently serves 10 schools; within the next year, Cheboi hopes to be partnered with 100 more. \u201cMy hope is that when the first TechLit kids graduate high school, they\u2019re able to get a job online because they will know how to code, they will know how to do graphic design, they will know how to do marketing,\u201d Cheboi said. \u201cThe world is your oyster when you are educated. By bringing the resources, by bringing these skills, we are opening up the world to them.\u201d CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper and ABC\u2019s Kelly Ripa co-hosted the 16th Annual \u201cCNN Heroes: An All-Star Tribute,\u201d which featured more than a dozen celebrity presenters. \u201cWe\u2019re so deeply honored to be here,\u201d said actress and singer Sofia Carson, who perfomed a song with award-winning songwriter Diane Warren at the event. \u201cDiane wrote this incredible anthem \u2018Applause\u2019 for those leading, surviving and fighting and tonight we dedicate this song and performance to our heroes.\u201d Actor Aubrey Plaza introduced CNN Hero Aidan Reilly, who launched his nonprofit while home from college during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cFrom his pandemic couch, Aidan and his friends co-founded Farmlink Project,\u201d Plaza said. The nonprofit connects excess food from farms across the US \u2013 food that would otherwise be wasted \u2013 to those who need it. \u201cIn just two years, he .. has moved more than 70 million pounds,\u201d Plaza added. CNN spotlights 10 men and women who are making the world a better place Debra Vines \u2013 whose nonprofit The Answer Inc. supports families impacted by autism in underserved communities across Chicago \u2013 was honored by actress Holly Robinson Peete, a \u201cfellow autism mom.\u201d Vines says her group has provided programming and guidance to more than 4,000 families. \u201cJoin me and be a servant for the change today,\u201d Vines said when accepting her award. And Emmy award-winning actor Justin Theroux brought his rescue dog Kuma, on the stage to honor Carie Broecker \u200b\u200band her nonprofit, Peace of Mind Dog Rescue. Two teenagers making a difference in their communities were also honored as 2022 Young Wonders: Ruby Chitsey, a 15-year-old from Harrison, Arkansas, started \u201cThree Wishes for Ruby\u2019s Residents,\u201d which donates personal items to nursing home residents who couldn\u2019t otherwise afford them. Sri Nihal Tammana, a 13-year-old from Edison, New Jersey, started \u201cRecycle My Battery,\u201d which keeps used batteries out of the ecosystem through a network of collection bins. The show also honored two Georgia poll workers, Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, whose lives were upended after false allegations that they had been involved in election fraud spread on social media. CNN has partnered with GoFundMe to enable donations to this year\u2019s Top 10 honorees. GoFundMe is the world\u2019s largest fundraising platform that empowers people and charities to give and receive help. Supporters can make online donations to the Top 10 CNN Heroes\u2019 non-profit organizations directly from CNNHeroes.com. Subaru is matching all donations up to $50,000 for each of this year\u2019s honorees through January 3, 2023.

            "article_content": "Miguel Romero proudly calls himself a \u201cFlorida boy.\u201d He loves the Sunshine State\u2019s warm weather. He\u2019s lived in the same neighborhood in Lee County, along Florida\u2019s southwestern coast, for most of his life. It\u2019s where he got his first job, at a Wendy\u2019s, when he was 16. It\u2019s where he drove his first car, a white Buick Century that he bought from his godfather. It\u2019s where he met his partner, Nicole, during senior year of high school. Together, they now share a 1-year-old daughter, Emma \u2013 a name inspired by one of Nicole\u2019s favorite shows, \u201cFriends.\u201d Money was always tight, but life on Linda Loma Drive was good, Romero says. The family had big plans for this year: they were going to visit an annual Halloween attraction in Orlando. For the first time, Romero was hoping to see his favorite stand-up comedian live later this month. They were hoping to set up their first at-home aquarium in the large fish tank Romero recently purchased. Someday soon, the couple hoped to get married here, too. But Hurricane Ian changed their plans. Linda Loma Drive, a short street just 10 minutes away from the island of Fort Myers Beach, is home to predominantly lower- and working-class families, some of them immigrants, whose homes were flooded by the powerful storm in late September. Like Romero\u2019s family, most of his neighbors are longtime tenants who spent days after the hurricane cleaning their rental homes and piling on their driveways the moldy furniture, electrical devices and cherished memories that the floodwaters destroyed. \u201cIt was so surreal,\u201d Romero, 26, said on an early October afternoon, as he walked around his empty apartment. \u201cIt took us hours and hours to clean all this up and \u2026 the big trash trucks with the claws, they just come in, they pick that stuff up like it\u2019s nothing.\u201d \u201cYears\u2019 worth of hard work gone in a matter of five minutes,\u201d he said. That wasn\u2019t all they lost. Days after the storm, Romero says his landlord announced they had less than two weeks to move out so that repairs from the flood damage could begin. And he offered no guarantee they\u2019d be able to move back in after those were finished, Romero says. The news came as a gut punch, shattering the image of the life Romero had envisioned for the months and years ahead. Romero used his savings to rent a storage unit while he frantically looked for a new apartment. But in an area that was already deep in a housing crisis before the hurricane, that quickly proved next to impossible, and his family was forced to look to a different state. Ian made landfall 20 miles from their mobile home community. Left with scraps and debris, these longtime neighbors wonder what's next \u201cI\u2019m just sad, heartbroken and hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cMentally, I\u2019m not in a good place, but I also can\u2019t afford to let my family see that, especially my little girl.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one that was pushed out after the storm. Tenants in several communities across the state\u2019s three hardest-hit counties received orders to vacate their homes, according to reports compiled by the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC). Low-income households, which typically receive the \u201cleast assistance and fewest protections where recovering,\u201d were those most impacted, the coalition said last month. In states like Florida, where available housing is already scarce, landlords have used natural disasters as opportunities to push those tenants out to fetch higher prices, says Sarah Saadian, the coalition\u2019s senior vice president of public policy and field organizing. \u201cWhat happens is that households that are already struggling are pushed deeper into housing instability,\u201d Saadian said. \u201cAnd the worst cases result in homelessness.\u201d Nearly two months since the storm ripped through the state, many Floridians who were forced to leave their homes have had to start their lives from scratch, with little money and help in doing so. For Romero\u2019s family, family trips and plans for new hobbies and shows are now out of reach. Instead, they\u2019re planning to use all their savings for their big move to Indiana on November 19. \u201cPeople who spent years saving \u2026 in the midst of and in response to an emergency like this when they\u2019re displaced, that money is gone,\u201d said Sheena Rolle, senior director of strategy for local grassroots advocacy group Florida Rising. Romero said he\u2019s dreading the day of the move. But staying in Florida was simply not an option: the financial assistance the family received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency was not nearly enough to help pay the bills or cover housing, he says. Rent in Indiana is nearly a third of what it is in Florida and family members who already live there told Romero he will likely be able to get a job at a factory. These Floridians were hit by Hurricane Ian a month ago. Here's what FEMA has done for them so far \u201cYou can only take in so much canned goods, so much water, so much clothes,\u201d Romero said. \u201cWhat people really need is money. Money to get back on our feet.\u201d For others, what comes next is a question unanswered. A 24-year-old mother of three who lived in the same neighborhood says her family was given just days to move out of their home after Ian hit. The woman did not want to be identified for fear of retaliation by her previous landlord, who other family members are also renting from. The woman tells CNN she moved to the neighborhood with her spouse and their children nearly three years ago \u2013 a special milestone that marked the first time the family lived on its own. In that short time, the family made their house a home, filling it with memories including \u201cToy Story\u201d and \u201cMinions\u201d movie nights, spaghetti and meatball preparations for when dad returned from work and bedtime rituals for the three young children \u2013 1- and 6-year-old sons and a 2-year-old daughter. The family evacuated ahead of Hurricane Ian. When they returned, everything was ruined, drenched by more than five feet of floodwater that poured inside the home. They were at least able to save some clothes, the woman says. And then, they found out her spouse was now unemployed after the Sanibel Island restaurant he worked in was decimated. The woman tells CNN she called her landlord to ask for some more time past October 1 \u2013 their usual pay period for rent \u2013 while they worked to rearrange their savings. His response: they had two days to get everything out. \u201cI was crying,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what I was going to do. We didn\u2019t know where we were going to go.\u201d They have been staying with family since the eviction, the woman says, but that\u2019s a temporary solution and they don\u2019t know where they\u2019ll be able to move to next. In times of disaster, when local and state governments are often consumed by response efforts, it\u2019s often more likely that some landlords will engage in illegal practices to push tenants out and tenants often don\u2019t have access to legal counsel to fight back, says Saadian, with the NLIHC. That problem is exacerbated by challenges that have existed long before the storms hit, like a lack of renter protections and a lack of enforcement for the protections that do exist, Saadian says. \u201cThe households that are going to be most harmed are those low-income renters who don\u2019t have a lot of options for affordable places to live anyways,\u201d Saadian said. \u201cWhat we see in many cases is homelessness increases.\u201d In Houston, after years of declines in the homeless population, advocates recorded a 15% increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness in 2018, the year after Hurricane Harvey pummeled Texas, according to a report from the Coalition for the Homeless. There are still people this year who attribute their homelessness to that storm, the report says. \u201cRenters whose buildings got impacted or destroyed (in a disaster) have no recourse,\u201d said Rolle, with Florida Rising. \u201cThey either must live through what would in any other situation be deemed unlivable conditions or they must flee.\u201d On the street behind Romero\u2019s old home, Melissa Harper says she also faces an approaching deadline to leave her house. The neighborhood quickly became a safe haven for Harper, offering a newfound stability after she spent more than a year experiencing homelessness during the Covid-19 pandemic. About a month before the storm hit, Harper moved in with her boyfriend and a good friend of his, a man who had been renting the single-story home for more than a decade. Much like Romero\u2019s family, the three of them spent the days after the storm cleaning out the destruction. And though most of their furniture and electric devices were gone, they felt hopeful they\u2019d be able to continue living there, adding new pieces of furniture they found at donation drives or on the street. Several weeks after the storm, their landlord gave them a December 1 deadline to leave, Harper says, adding she was informed he had plans to turn the home into an Airbnb. \u201cIt\u2019s put a lot of pressure on us and a lot of stress. We haven\u2019t saved any money because we had to pay that rent,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just taking it day by day.\u201d The latest rounds of evictions after Hurricane Ian highlight a dire need to add more protections for renters, including following disasters, and ensure they have access to housing and financial resources, both Rolle and Saadian tell CNN. Rep. Val Demings, who last week lost to Sen. Marco Rubio in the election for the US Senate, introduced a bill in September to protect residents from evictions during and after disasters like hurricanes. The bill has been endorsed by organizations including the National Low Income Housing Coalition and the National Housing Law Project. \u201cAt any moment, your life can change and your options are few, but the rules surrounding what you can and can\u2019t do are many,\u201d Rolle said. \u201cSome of this is climate change, some of this is the Earth. A lot of it is bad leadership, bad policy that ignores people at the bottom rung of the ladder.\u201d Romero hopes coverage of stories like his could bring about some change. The eviction \u2013 more than the storm itself \u2013 shifted their entire lives and futures.

            "article_content": "An Indiana lawmaker is apologizing for saying teachers should exercise impartiality when teaching about Nazism or fascism. During a committee hearing Wednesday on legislation regarding how certain lessons are taught in school, state senator and bill co-author Scott Baldwin said, \u201cI have no problem with the education system providing instruction on the existence of those \u2018isms.\u2019  I believe that we\u2019ve gone too far when we take a position on those \u2018isms.\u2019  As it relates \u2026 we need to be impartial.\u201d His remarks came after a concerned history teacher said he was teaching Nazism in his history class, and that when teaching the subject he does not remain neutral. Black parents say movement to ban critical race theory is ruining their children's education \u201cWe\u2019re learning about the rise of fascism and the rise of Nazism right now and I\u2019m just not neutral on the political ideology of fascism. \u2026 I tell my students the purpose in a democracy of understanding the traits of fascism is so that we can recognize it, and we can combat it. That is why we learn to use history to make a better world,\u201d the teacher said. Baldwin, a Republican first elected to state office in 2020, responded that he was not \u201cdiscrediting any of those \u2018isms\u2019 out there.\u201d In an email to CNN, Baldwin says he \u201cunequivocally condemn[s] Nazism, fascism and Marxism\u201d and that he is \u201copen to changes that can improve the bill.\u201d \u201cWhen I said in the meeting, \u2018I\u2019m with you on those particular -isms,\u2019 that is what I meant to convey. As someone who fought to defend our democracy, I agree teachers should condemn those dangerous ideologies and I sincerely regret that I did not articulate that and apologize for it,\u201d said Baldwin, whose website says he served in the Marines. \u201cWe absolutely need to teach our children about the tragedies of the past, which is why the legislation in its current form specifically protects the teaching of historical injustices. I said Wednesday that we need to listen and be open to changes that can improve the bill, and we are working on amendments to that end,\u201d he said. The legislation in question, Senate Bill 167, arose from the national conversation swirling around the topic of critical race theory. The concept has become a social and political lightning rod with several states banning critical race theory and Republicans pledging to make it core to their midterm election strategy. Educators insist that critical race theory \u2013 which acknowledges that racism is both systemic and institutional in American society \u2013 is generally not included in grade school curriculum. The concept is usually taught in law school or graduate school. The Indiana bill, in part, says that school curriculum \u201cmay not include or promote certain concepts as part of a course of instruction or in a curriculum or direct or otherwise compel a school employee or student to adhere to certain tenets relating to the individual\u2019s sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, national origin, or political affiliation.\u201d",

            "article_content": "This is the second feature of CNN's new series \"History Refocused,\" surprising and personal stories from America's past that may bring new depth to the conflicts still raging today. On April 11, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln delivered what would be his last speech from a window at the White House to the crowd below. They had gathered there expecting a celebratory speech on Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee\u2019s surrender to Ulysses S. Grant just two days earlier. But that evening, Lincoln\u2019s speech was about Reconstruction, readmitting Louisiana into the Union and a proposal for \u201cgiving the benefit of public schools equally to Black and White, and empowering the Legislature to confer the elective franchise upon the colored man.\u201d Plantation-owning elites, Southern Democrats and White supremacists, however, would not easily concede political power to those who had so recently been their slaves. That evening among the crowd of listeners was an enraged John Wilkes Booth, who would go on to assassinate the President just three days later at Ford\u2019s Theatre. For decades after Lincoln\u2019s death, White supremacists would wage a war of intimidation, murder and massacre on anyone, Black or White, who dared covet a share of their power. Yet, Black people persisted. And between 1865 and 1880, over 1,500 Black men took political office; most not for long, as their efforts were cut down by mobs of violent White men. Oscar James Dunn was one of those determined men.\u00a0He became the country\u2019s first Black lieutenant governor in Louisiana in 1868\u00a0but died mysteriously in office only four years later. For some\u00a0experts, the 2021 Capitol riots are a present-day example and a legacy of the same kind of violent push back against the rise of Black men that Dunn and others experienced after the Civil War. For the second story in our series, History Refocused, we spoke with historian Brian K. Mitchell, who spent years unearthing Dunn\u2019s life \u2013 a passion ignited as a child after learning that he and Dunn were uniquely linked. History Refocused: This 15-year-old was the original Rosa Parks \u201cOscar Dunn\u2019s story cannot explain the entire notion of Reconstruction,\u201d Mitchell said. But \u201cIt does give students a very tangible person that they can wrap their minds around.\u201d As a history professor at the University of Arkansas, Little Rock, Brian K. Mitchell dives deep into stories such as Dunn\u2019s. Mitchell remembers vividly the moment his elementary school teacher refused to acknowledge that a Black man had ever achieved real power in Louisiana. One day in class, Mitchell\u2019s hand shot up when the teacher asked if anyone had famous family members. He remembered his great-grandmother had once laid out newspaper clippings to tell him the story of his relative, Oscar James Dunn. His teacher was having none of it. As a historian, Mitchell later saw her lapse of historical knowledge was common \u2013 the result of a successful campaign to rewrite everything that happened during the Civil War and after. \u201cI was taught that Reconstruction was a failed attempt, that it was awful and that the Black leadership that came in was totally inept,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cThat is totally untrue.\u201d Dunn was born a slave and set free in 1832 by his future stepfather. He grew up to be bright and educated, trying his hand at teaching music and masonry. He became a leader among the Freemasons and saw an opportunity to use his skills during the Civil War. Dunn knew businessmen and plantation owners still needed workers. So he started an employment agency, connecting the newly freed men and women with jobs and keeping them from getting cheated. He was wildly successful. \u201cOscar James Dunn is the personification of African American hope and African American values in the United States,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cThroughout his whole life, he\u2019s always learning.\u201d In the mid-1860s, Dunn joined a group of elite Black, colored and Afro-Creoles in Louisiana, then a hard-line racist state, who had economic status but yearned for more political power. In 1865, he and others formed a group called the \u201cFriends of Universal Suffrage,\u201d sending delegates to lobby Lincoln and his Republican party to show them just how much support they would get if they allowed Black men in the South to vote. Lincoln supported the vote for these educated Black men and for former soldiers, but neither he nor his Republican Party advocated for universal suffrage. After Lincoln\u2019s death, historian Kate Masur said support grew, but only to a point. What 6 historians want you to know about Abraham Lincoln \u201cSome of these White Republicans would have thought African Americans deserve to be free,\u201d said Masur. \u201cBut voting? That seems like a bridge too far.\u201d It would take years of unrest before crushing violence changed their minds. In late 1865, President Andrew Johnson declared national unity and quickly folded Southern states back into the Union. Johnson often clashed with his Republican Congress, for it believed only a strong hand could deal with the emboldened former Confederates still running things at the local level. While Freedman\u2019s Bureau workers empowered former slaves through education and resettlement, Southern states passed \u201cBlack codes\u201d restricting their rights. Black people were entrapped into work contracts, arrested for carrying guns and forced to watch their children taken away and \u201capprenticed\u201d to Whites. See much more incredible archival imagery in our video on the time period. White Supremacist groups formally organize; the Ku Klux Klan held its first meeting that December in Pulaski, Tennessee, and the Knights of the White Camelia form two years later. In July of 1866, 25 Louisiana Radical Republicans held a meeting in support of voting rights for freedmen at the Mechanics Institute in New Orleans. Tensions in the South were rising \u2013 one month earlier, dozens of Black people had been killed by White rioters in Memphis with little repercussion \u2013 and Dunn was warned not to go. In New Orleans, hundreds of Black supporters paraded toward the Institute. They were soon surrounded and attacked by an angry White mob \u2013 many of them police officers \u2013 and dozens were killed. But Dunn had stayed away and was safe. He later testified in front of a Congressional Committee sent from Washington, who concluded that ex-Confederates in the local government were to blame for inciting the attack. The violence was enough to push Congress to act. They overrode a veto from President Johnson and passed the first of several Reconstruction Acts in 1867. The Act broke the South into districts and put federal military generals in charge, weakening the hold of Confederate sympathizers. Gen. Philip Henry Sheridan, who was in command in Louisiana, appointed Dunn to the City Council and Dunn became the new \u201cassistant recorder,\u201d or what Mitchell calls a sort of \u201cmini-mayor.\u201d His job included overseeing cases in the same courtrooms where, a few years earlier, Black people had no right to defend themselves. Dunn was fair, trusted by Black and White, and positioned himself perfectly for when Black people were finally allowed to take part in new elections. \u201cThe Black vote today would not even come close to the proportion of eligible voters who are going to the polls in the late 1860s and early \u201970s,\u201d said Mitchell of the swell of Black freedmen showing up across the South to cast ballots. On July 11, 1868, Dunn became lieutenant governor of Louisiana, serving under Henry Clay Warmoth on the Republican ticket. Dunn\u2019s first legislative address showed hope and restraint: \u201cAs to myself and my people, we are not seeking social equality. That is a thing no law can govern,\u201d said Dunn. \u201cWe simply ask to be allowed an equal chance in the race of life.\u201d Not two months later, hundreds of Black men, women and children would be massacred by more White mobs in St. Landry Parish, New Orleans. The anger of White Southern Democrats seethed and boiled up over the new elections. Before the War, society in the South had been defined by social class, and sitting comfortably at the top were White plantation owners, who did not work. Relegating labor to lesser people defined who you were as a successful White Southerner. When that free labor was taken away, so too was the very question of what defined Whiteness \u2013 if you\u2019re laboring like Blacks, what separates you from them? White Democrat leaders had thought they could cobble together racist laws and cling to webs of social codes to keep Blacks subjugated, but they came to believe all would be lost if Blacks and Republicans used the power of the vote to dismantle their rules. \u201cThe heart of Louisiana was big slave plantations and most Whites in Louisiana were deeply committed to White supremacy,\u201d said Eric Foner, an expert in Lincoln and Louisiana history. Those who weren\u2019t deeply committed to White Supremacy would soon find themselves under pressure. Many lower-class Whites had grown used to working beside Blacks, but middle and upper-class Whites perpetuated the idea of Whiteness as \u201canti-Blackness.\u201d Whites were often outnumbered by Blacks in many Southern areas, and feared unfounded and irrational threats dreamed up by powerful, partisan local newspapers. The idea of using violence to keep Whites safely in power became a social craze that soaked through communities and, as historians argue, never truly dried out. Foner made a comparison to the January 6 mob attack. \u201cYou know, we recently saw a mob of White supremacists assaulting the Capitol building in order to overturn an election, and people on TV always said this is unprecedented,\u201d said Foner. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s not unprecedented. It\u2019s what\u2019s happened to Louisiana a number of times in Reconstruction.\u201d Howard University historian Edna Greene Medford echoed that statement, but also pointed to what happened in Georgia that same day \u2013 Black organizers driving voters to elect a Jewish senator and a Black senator. Sen. Raphael G. Warnock is only the country\u2019s 11th Black US senator to serve. \u201cIf Black people didn\u2019t vote, you wouldn\u2019t see this violence,\u201d said Medford. \u201cIt\u2019s people wielding political power and others feeling that they\u2019re losing the vote they always had.\u201d \u201cWhat does this permanent shift mean to a class of people who always held political power and have always held economic power?\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cWhat does this mean for White America if it has to share this notion of who has the right to rule?\u201d The 15th Amendment, which aimed to protect the vote, was ratified in 1870,  just as White Northerners grew tired of the costly military occupation of the South. The generals, armies and the Freedman\u2019s Bureau slowly withdrew, leaving men like Oscar Dunn exposed. In 1869, Dunn embarked on an ambitious train trip from New Orleans to Boston hoping to meet with abolitionists, senators and state leaders. He\u2019s welcomed by some but shunned by others. He\u2019s refused service at White hotels and moved to segregated train cars, and realized none of the Civil Rights laws passed by Congress could begin to fight the racism so deeply rooted throughout the country \u2013 South to North. But when he visited Washington after President Ulysses S. Grant\u2019s inauguration, he was invited by the President to the White House \u2013 the first-ever invitation for an elected African American official. Dunn was above reproach, he didn\u2019t drink or smoke and he shunned bribes. His work addressed the plights of Blacks, but also that of poor White families, long-suffering under a society controlled by planter elites. \u201cBoth Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and radicals, saw in Dunn a pragmatism and fairness that he always tried to do the right thing by everyone,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cAnd many times this will come back to bite him.\u201d In 1871, Louisiana Gov. Warmoth injured himself so badly in a boat accident that Dunn took over his gubernatorial duties, against his wishes. He\u2019s believed to be the first Black man to do so. Warmoth had been losing popularity, was accused of corruption and began distancing himself from the freedmen he had promised to support. Warmoth and Dunn were at odds \u2013 he didn\u2019t like to see Dunn so easily acting as his substitute. Mitchell describes Oscar James Dunn\u2019s final days as suspicious; one night after a dinner, Dunn fell violently ill. His friends believed he\u2019d been poisoned. He died quickly afterward at the age of 45, just shy of completing his full four-year-term. Mitchell says it\u2019s later revealed that he\u2019d been on Grant\u2019s list of possible vice presidential picks. Tens of thousands attended his funeral. Warmoth was later removed from office, eventually making way for P.B.S. Pinchback, who would briefly become Louisiana\u2019s first Black governor. A monument was planned in 1873 in Dunn\u2019s honor but was never built. The \u201cLost Cause\u201d narrative took over and the accomplishments of Black leaders during Reconstruction were whitewashed, erased from Southern textbooks and vilified by movies, such as \u201cBirth of a Nation,\u201d which made Black congressional leaders look unintelligent and incompetent. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to say that the reason that Reconstruction was a failure was the ineptitude of Black politicians, Dunn was the model politician,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cHe was generous. He was kind. He was honest. And that is not the value set in history that they want to record.\u201d But history has new storytellers. As Confederate statues come down, Mitchell hopes men like Oscar James Dunn can replace them, putting them back in the spotlight. The National Park Service is reworking its entire messaging on Reconstruction with help from historians like Kate Masur, and a new National Reconstruction monument is now in Beaufort, South Carolina. But it is Mitchell\u2019s work on Dunn that revives his ancestor most vividly. He\u2019s turned Dunn into a superhero for a graphic novel he co-wrote called, Monumental, putting a Black person as one of the real stars of the country\u2019s evolving legacy. \u201cI want children to know that they can be anyone that they choose to be and historically they have played a part in every facet of American history,\u201d said Mitchell. \u201cThey are just as important to the American narrative as anyone else.\u201d For more on the life of the 16th president, watch CNN\u2019s Original Series \u201cLincoln: Divided We Stand\u201d Sundays at 10 p.m. ET/PT.",

            "article_content": "Facing a dramatically narrowed path to passing legislation next year, the White House has started to zero in on potential openings that Republicans\u2019 precariously slim, four-seat House majority may create. Officials acknowledged the sweeping legislative wins of President Joe Biden\u2019s first two years, several of which were clinched with bipartisan support and significant work with a small number of Senate Republicans, will be near impossible to replicate given the control and ideological makeup of the Republican-led House. The basic tasks of a functioning government will become high-stakes standoffs. Spending battles will shift from arduous tight-rope walks to outright warfare. And the looming debt ceiling deadline next year and the potential for catastrophic debt default drew enough concern from White House officials that they weighed a push to address it in the current Congress to take it off the table entirely. Yet at Biden\u2019s direction, White House officials have quietly engaged in early-stage preparations for the new reality on Capitol Hill, homing in on two key groups as they search for issues that can draw bipartisan support: moderate Republicans with a proven track record of working across the aisle and the incoming class of freshmen Republicans who flipped districts Biden won two years earlier. Those lawmakers will make up the core of any White House effort to secure the bipartisan wins that officials said Biden is keenly interested in pursuing in the two years ahead. They will also be key to any White House hopes of scuttling Republican bills in the House and attempts to squeeze House GOP leadership on key issues. Clues to that nascent strategy for dealing with a Republican House next year are plastered all over the walls of White House legislative affairs director Louisa Terrell\u2019s office, which are adorned with the names of House Republicans who voted for key pieces of bipartisan legislation in Biden\u2019s first two years in office: the 24 who supported the CHIPS and Science Act, the 13 who voted for the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and the nine who backed reforms to the Electoral Count Act. In a West Wing where officials say they are clear-eyed about the battles that loom in divided government, it\u2019s easy to see the tallies as a requiem to the past. But the vast majority of the Republicans on those lists were reelected. And they will soon be joined by the new class of Republicans who, in flipping districts Biden won two years earlier, effectively clinched Republicans\u2019 narrow, four-seat majority. \u201cWhen you have Republicans representing Biden districts heading into a presidential election cycle, there\u2019s no question it adds a different element in terms of their approach \u2013 and ours,\u201d a senior administration official said. The preparations for the months ahead remain in the early stage, officials said. The central focus remains on closing out the final days of unified power in Washington, DC, by securing the passage of the annual defense policy bill and a sweeping bipartisan spending agreement that includes significant new funding to assist Ukraine\u2019s war effort, as well as a bipartisan measure to close loopholes in the Electoral Count Act that brought the country to the brink on January 6, 2021. There\u2019s also the issue of the makeup of the new House majority itself, with Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican expected to be the next speaker, firmly in the grips of his own intraparty battle to secure the votes for that ascension. Biden spoke to McCarthy by phone shortly after the election and the California Republican was one of four leaders to meet with Biden at the White House a few weeks later. Biden said he had hopes that there would be areas of bipartisan agreement in the next Congress \u201cbecause the American people want us to work together.\u201d McCarthy, after the meeting, told reporters he \u201ccan work with anyone,\u201d but noted the new Republican majority clinched in the midterms signaled \u201cAmerica likes a check and balance.\u201d But the continued uncertainty across Washington about McCarthy\u2019s pathway to the speakership has tacitly created another reason for what serves as somewhat of a wait-and-see posture in terms of engaging House Republicans. Still, behind the scenes and driven by Biden\u2019s mantra that all politics is personal, the White House\u2019s legislative affairs team has begun doing deep dives on newly elected Republican lawmakers, compiling comprehensive profiles of their districts and the issues at the heart of their winning campaigns, according to a senior White House official. The White House\u2019s goal: to better understand those lawmakers and what makes them tick as they seek out pressure points and areas of potential compromise. After two years of seeking out ways to connect Biden, a 36-year Senate veteran with a keen awareness of the importance of even the smallest of priorities back home for elected officials, to rank-and-file members from both parties, the effort will to some degree track and expand on what officials leaned on in their first two years. But as officials confront a landscape that has closed the door on the Democrat-only legislative pathway that led to two of Biden\u2019s most consequential legislative wins \u2013 the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and his cornerstone $700 billion economic and climate law \u2013 those efforts take on a new level of salience. \u201cThe option is get absolutely nothing done or find a way to make this work,\u201d a House Democrat told CNN. \u201cSeparating the inevitable, and at times likely insane, partisan warfare from the areas we can get stuff done isn\u2019t easy, but I can\u2019t see two years of nothing appealing to someone like (Biden.)\u201d Outreach from the White House to the newly elected members is sure to follow the preparation currently under way. Each member of the White House\u2019s legislative affairs team is charged with liaising with a list of individual members and at least one committee, a senior White House official said. While the contours of the White House\u2019s strategy and some of its targets are coming into view, officials are still determining the exact steps they will take to reach their objectives \u2013 and they are waiting to see exactly what dynamic they will face in the House next year. Biden\u2019s top legislative officials have spent the last month primarily focused on wrapping up the major spending negotiations of the current Congress and have held off on significant outreach to Republicans about next year\u2019s Congress. And Republicans are in the midst of their own intraparty war over who will serve as the next speaker of the House, and the new members aren\u2019t even in Washington for another couple of weeks. \u201cWe\u2019re content to let them shoot at one another at the moment,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cWe have a record and, driven by the president, very clear way in which we approach the importance of these relationships. That will certainly be reflected in the next Congress.\u201d The next Congress, even with the Republican majority in the House, is set to look different than many White House officials expected in the lead up to Election Day. While they were confident in the popularity of their legislative agenda, the combination of economic headwinds in the form of persistent inflation and historical precedent that showed nearly every president took losses in the first midterm election led to a less than ideal environment. Instead of the \u201cred wave\u201d predicted by Republicans, however, Biden\u2019s party expanded its Senate majority and stunned House Republicans \u2013 and many Democrats \u2013 by nearly fighting to a draw in the chamber. While Republicans flipped the House, they did so with a mere four seat advantage on the backs of candidates who were hardly acolytes of former President Donald Trump. Several represent districts that voted for Biden in 2020. Democrats are already eyeing those incoming lawmakers \u2013 four of whom represent districts in New York \u2013 as top targets for Democrats\u2019 efforts to retake the House in 2024 and White House officials expect they will be under more pressure than other Republicans to reach bipartisan deals they can take back to their districts. A pair of those incoming New York Republicans \u2013 Reps.-elect Anthony D\u2019Esposito and Michael Lawler \u2013 said they both see an opportunity to work with the White House to pass legislation, though they have yet to hear from the White House. \u201cWe have been, you know, sort of named majority makers here in New York,\u201d D\u2019Esposito told CNN. \u201cAnd to be honest, if we want to maintain that majority, if we want to keep the seats that we flipped, then we have no choice but then to work in a bipartisan fashion to deliver.\u201d D\u2019Esposito said House Republican leaders have assured him they understand the need for bipartisanship to hold onto the majority in 2024 and \u201cthat there are going to be times where perhaps the members from Long Island have to put their vote in support of things that are going to deliver for Long Island.\u201d \u201cWhen you have a small majority, everybody is empowered to a degree,\u201d said Lawler, who defeated House Democrats\u2019 campaign chief in suburban New York. \u201cThe objective should be to make sure that we are working as a conference to pass legislation that the conference can get behind and that has the best chance of passing the Senate and being signed by the White House.\u201d One House Republican told CNN that freshmen Republican lawmakers like Lawler and D\u2019Esposito will have \u201creal leverage.\u201d \u201cI get the Trump focus and I get the Freedom Caucus focus,\u201d one House Republican told CNN of the former president and the hard right group of House Republicans who hold significant sway inside the conference. \u201cBut we go nowhere without our freshmen \u2013 and while I\u2019m not sure they\u2019ll use it, that creates very real leverage.\u201d For Biden and his team, who capitalized in their first two years in office on a number of moderate or bipartisan-minded Senate Republicans willing to work across the aisle on shared priorities, there are now opportunities among House Republicans that in large part have all but promised to declare outright legislative war on the White House. Biden was often a key interlocutor with Republican lawmakers during his time as vice president under President Barack Obama and was elected in part on promises of finding common ground with Republicans. While Biden delivered in part on that promise with several bipartisan deals in the Senate, a Republican House brings a new degree of difficulty that officials acknowledged will force them to implement some new approaches if they hope to get substantive legislation passed next year. Even if the White House can convince enough Republicans to buck their party on key bills, the speaker of the House controls what legislation comes up for a vote in the chamber. Recent House GOP leaders have attempted to stick close to an unofficial idea that nothing should move forward without a \u201cmajority of the majority\u201d in support of the measure, though the approach was often scrapped in times of crisis or must-pass legislative moments. Discharge petitions, which can be used by a majority of members to bring a bill up for a vote, are rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 successful. The stark reality for White House officials is despite a fractured incoming majority, which to this point still doesn\u2019t include a member with enough support to lock up the speakership, there are major limitations on legislative efforts ahead in the House. A senior White House official declined to say whether the White House would focus on trying to strike bipartisan agreements with Republican leadership or try and peel off moderate Republicans through the use of discharge petitions, calling those decisions premature. The official also declined to say whether Biden will engage more directly with Republican lawmakers, but noted that Biden has a track record of engaging with Republicans during his time in office, even if many of those conversations are private and undisclosed. \u201cAs I have throughout my career, I\u2019m going to continue to work across the aisle to deliver for the American people. And it\u2019s not always easy, but we did it the first term,\u201d Biden said in his post-midterm election news conference last month.  \u201cI\u2019m prepared to work with my Republican colleagues. The American people have made clear, I think, that they expect Republicans to be prepared to work with me as well.",

            "article_content": "As White House officials reflected on the final Democratic victory of a history-defying midterm election cycle, one constant has been a sense of validation. For President Joe Biden, the expanded Senate majority clinched by Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock\u2019s reelection in Georgia on Tuesday night served as a capstone driven in large part by two years of cornerstone legislative wins. \u201cWhat you saw Senator Warnock do and what you saw Democrats do this past election is run on the president\u2019s agenda \u2013 run on an agenda that was successful,\u201d White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters. \u201cThis was a success for Democrats, but also for President Biden.\u201d Legislative success will be much harder to come by in the two years to come, even with an additional Senate vote, officials acknowledge. Republicans will soon take the majority in the House and have made clear their opposition to Biden \u2013 and his agenda \u2013 will serve as an animating feature of their policy and political priorities in the months ahead. Still, the two years of unified Democratic control, even with the barest of majorities, played a critical role in not just blunting sweeping GOP wins, but actually gaining a seat in the Senate, according to Biden aides and congressional Democrats. As Republicans grappled with the ever-present, disruptive and defining grip of former President Donald Trump, Democrats had an advantage in campaigns driven by legislative accomplishments. Even Democrats, like Warnock, who sought to distance themselves from Biden and his sagging approval ratings, pointed to their legislative successes. The most shocking Senate result: Every incumbent won The victories for Biden\u2019s agenda included trillions of dollars touching nearly every aspect of the US economy, manufacturing, infrastructure and climate policy, all of which have been broadly popular when taken in isolation. Biden used his campaign appearances as an opportunity to tick through the lengthy list of those policies. So did top Democratic surrogates \u2013 none more so than former President Barack Obama. But as Democrats grappled with the possibility of sweeping GOP wins in the weeks before the November election, there were no shortage of questions about whether the tangible effect of the investment and policy changes had reached voters. While White House officials dismissed the criticism, even Biden appeared to acknowledge the possibility. \u201cWe\u2019ve passed so many good things,\u201d Biden said at a fundraiser a few days before the election. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so good people haven\u2019t realized how good they are yet.\u201d Yet Warnock\u2019s campaign served as a window into a strategy built on Biden\u2019s agenda, tailored around the most popular provisions \u2013 and those that could be broken out to show the direct effect on Georgia. In television ads and speeches throughout his campaign, Warnock highlighted the core elements of Biden\u2019s agenda including measures to lower the costs of prescription drugs, cap insulin at $35, and boost investment in US infrastructure. \u201cI want you to remember what your vote did the last time,\u201d Warnock told voters during a campaign rally last week, listing bills passed by Congress to support domestic manufacturing and chip making, as well as cut health care costs. What a 51-49 Senate majority means for Democrats Warnock\u2019s message was one that was echoed in some form by Senate Democratic candidates in battleground states across the country, messages given a major boost by a late summer run of legislative success. That success, which included the manufacturing and veterans legislation as well as Biden\u2019s cornerstone economic and climate law, was a game-changer, according to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cThe turning point really occurred this summer, where we passed six major bills \u2013 five bipartisan \u2013 all of which affected people\u2019s lives,\u201d Schumer told reporters during a victory-lap press conference Wednesday morning. \u201cThey were the things people wanted.\u201d Warnock used campaign ads to highlight $8 million he helped secure for the Port of Savannah from the bipartisan infrastructure law. His role in the push for provisions to lower prescription drug costs for seniors was both elevated by White House and Senate Democratic leaders and highlighted extensively at home. \u201cThe truth is I\u2019ve focused on doing whatever I can for Georgia. Working with Republicans to promote American technology and to expand health care for Georgia veterans,\u201d Warnock said in another ad, referring to the sweeping $280 billion bipartisan law to boost US domestic chip-manufacturing and scientific research. Warnock made his central behind-the-scenes role in pressing Biden to cancel student loan debt a key element of his public campaign. 5 takeaways from Georgia's Senate runoff The executive order is now stalled in the courts and has an uncertain future despite Biden\u2019s insistence it passes legal muster. But its resonance as a voting issue, particularly among young voters critical to the Democratic coalition, was striking to White House officials in the months after its announcement. White House officials are also keen to point out how Herschel Walker, Warnock\u2019s Republican opponent, actively ran against Biden\u2019s agenda, attacking investments in climate and battery manufacturing and criticizing the infrastructure law during the primary. \u201cThis is a significant new testament, in an intensely competitive purple state, to how much the Biden agenda and mainstream values are resonating with the American middle class,\u201d said Andrew Bates, a White House spokesperson. As Warnock closed out what amounted to his fourth election in two years, he was boosted by a significant cash advantage, the view among Democrats and Republicans alike that he had clear momentum and the help of top surrogates like Obama. Biden himself didn\u2019t set foot in the state this fall, maintaining his position that he would do whatever candidates asked of him, even if that meant avoiding states like Georgia where his low approval rating served as a potential hindrance. But as Obama spoke beside Warnock in the final days of the campaign, his former vice president\u2019s agenda was central to his pitch, much as it had been for candidates in the months prior. \u201cBecause you did not act like everything was over, Democrats took back the Senate and were eventually able to translate that into people\u2019s lives being better in concrete ways,\u201d Obama said in a nod to Warnock\u2019s runoff victory in 2021. He then ticked through Biden\u2019s agenda, piece by piece.",

            "article_content": "Three Republican party committees on Tuesday asked the Georgia Supreme Court to halt Saturday early voting in the US Senate runoff. The petition \u2013 filed by the Republican National Committee, the Georgia Republican Party and the Republicans\u2019 Senate campaign arm \u2013 asks the state\u2019s high court to issue an emergency stay to block counties from offering voters the opportunity to cast ballots on the Saturday after Thanksgiving. In their petition, the Republican committees argue that only 10 counties \u2013 \u201call of them Democratic-leaning\u201d \u2013 plan to conduct early voting that day, \u201ceviscerating the statutorily required uniformity among Georgia\u2019s counties.\u201d Allowing a lower court ruling that permits Saturday voting to stand creates \u201can unequal system, where some counties will vote on November 26 and others will not,\u201d lawyers for the GOP committees wrote. Tuesday\u2019s filing is the latest legal twist in the high-profile, December 6 runoff election between Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker. The new court petition comes a day after an appeals judge \u2013 in a victory for Warnock and Democrats \u2013 denied the state\u2019s appeal of a lower court ruling that had allowed voting on the Saturday after a holiday. In their Tuesday petition to the state\u2019s high court, the Republican committees said two counties are having trouble staffing polling locations on Saturday, and many others are occupied with other tasks, such as testing and setting up machines for use in the runoff. The time-crunch election workers now face can be traced back to the controversial 2021 election law passed by the Republican-controlled Georgia legislature, which cut the time allowed for a runoff from nine weeks to four. Opponents of allowing early voting on this upcoming Saturday argue it violates a state law prohibiting voting on Saturday if there is a state holiday on the Thursday or Friday before. The suit that originally pushed for Saturday voting had been brought by Warnock\u2019s campaign, along with the Georgia Democratic Party and Democrats\u2019 Senate campaign arm. They argued that the state law did not apply to runoffs. Earlier Tuesday, voting rights advocates praised the lower court rulings that allowed Saturday balloting and publicly implored all 159 counties in the state to offer voting that day and to extend their hours on every early voting day. They said restricting advance voting could disenfranchise working-class Georgians. \u201cWith this new appeal \u2026 voters\u2019 right to the ballot box is in jeopardy again,\u201d Stephanie Ali, policy director of the New Georgia Project, said of the GOP\u2019s emergency petition.",

            "article_content": "Washington Republicans are in an uproar hours ahead of Donald Trump\u2019s expected launch of a new presidential run, exacerbated by the party\u2019s protracted wait for the House majority it will use to try to weaken President Joe Biden. Trump apparently plans to open the 2024 election cycle at his Mar-a-Lago resort Tuesday evening, despite the failure of his election-denying acolytes in the midterms and unusual ambivalence among GOP lawmakers over his prospects. His unsuccessful attempt to leverage the congressional elections to display his own power set off a mess of infighting and recriminations over the failure of the GOP to stir a red wave to claim big congressional majorities. It also raised questions over Trump\u2019s own 2024 general election viability. The result is that the GOP in Washington is further weakened and Trump is under some of the most intense pressure he\u2019s faced during a turbulent political career \u2013 even if there\u2019s no sign yet that his enduring power base in the party\u2019s adoring grassroots has eroded. The ex-President had clearly hoped to claim credit for a banner Republican midterm performance to supercharge his bid to win back the presidency, but the party failed to recapture the Senate \u2013 and a whole week from Election Day, it is still waiting for its control of the House to be confirmed. The GOP did add several seats overnight and now stands three seats short of the 218 it needs. But its eventual margin will be far smaller than it had hoped, meaning the majority will be volatile and hard to manage. Trump is on the defense as he prepares for expected 2024 announcement Still, while that could cause general chaos in Washington, it could give pro-Trump factions in the party the chance to maximize their leverage on potential House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who is facing a tougher than expected struggle to nail down the votes he would need to take the top job in January. On Monday evening, GOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona confirmed he would challenge McCarthy in a bid to show he didn\u2019t yet have sufficient support to speaker. Still, the California Republican and current minority leader did get a standing ovation after calling on his conference to show unity on Monday ahead of Tuesday\u2019s leadership elections. Back-biting has also broken out in the Senate GOP, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz slamming veteran Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, while Florida Sen. Rick Scott mulls a challenge despite his failed stewardship of the GOP campaign committee\u2019s bid to win the Senate. A fight also looms over control of the Republican National Committee. The finger-pointing is emerging over a disappointing performance for Republicans. Trump-style extremism was repudiated at the ballot box in a vote that ought to have been a referendum on an unpopular sitting president in a tough economy \u2013 rather than one on a predecessor who left the White House but won\u2019t go away. There is every logical reason for Republicans to move on from Trump. One lesson from last week\u2019s election is that voters didn\u2019t reject Republicans per se. Authentic conservatives who distanced themselves from the ex-president, like Govs. Brian Kemp of Georgia, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Ron DeSantis of Florida and Chris Sununu of New Hampshire cruised to reelection. But multiple Trump-backed candidates for governor, secretary of state posts, and Senate and House seats flamed out. One of the most high-profile election deniers, Arizona Republican Kari Lake, will lose to Democrat Katie Hobbs, CNN projected Monday evening. Democrats in Michigan, meanwhile, won control of the state legislature, which had spent the last two years on election-denying distractions. Swearing loyalty to Trump and his election fraud hot air proved to be a disastrous campaign strategy for many candidates. The projected defeat of Lake in the Arizona governor\u2019s race on Monday completes a near total rout of 2020 election deniers in swing states whom Trump thrust into the midterm elections. His determination to run again is already drawing widespread opposition among many Republicans on Capitol Hill, who are reeling from their failure to whip up a red wave to capture the Senate, where Democrats held on, and the House, which remains uncalled. A new Trump campaign would set up a test between the growing skepticism of his ambitions among the upper echelons of his party and the adoration millions of base voters still feel for the twice-impeached ex-president. Despite once telling supporters he\u2019d do so much winning they\u2019d get tired of it, Trump\u2019s record on Election Day is pretty thin \u2013 save from the transformative shock of his 2016 triumph over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Trump's 2024 bid gets harsh reaction among Hill Republicans The GOP\u2019s losses under his watch \u2013 when they lost the House in 2018 and the Senate two years later \u2013 are driving a debate over his political viability within the party he has long dominated. His foisting of poor quality, extreme, election-denying candidates on the GOP in this year\u2019s midterms is not just dampening his possible launch party. The ex-president is being accused of sabotaging his own team. But true to form, Trump has shown little sign of self-doubt. Instead, he\u2019s been attacking those Republicans who have proven they can build broad majorities more recently than he has \u2013 including DeSantis, his biggest potential threat in a presidential primary, and Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who campaigned for GOP candidates across the country this year after last year flipping a state Biden had won by 10 points. But while Trump\u2019s brand is tarnished and there are fresh doubts over whether a new campaign based on his obsessive claims of false voter fraud will fly in a general election, his past record of resilience suggests he shouldn\u2019t be dismissed. The 45th president has been down and damaged before \u2013 after the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape was released in his first campaign, when Republicans lost the House in 2018, and then again following his own general election defeat in 2020. He earned the historic shame of a second impeachment after inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol in 2021. Pence details fracture with Trump over his refusal to overturn 2020 election in new book But he\u2019s always bounced back, leveraging a near mythical bond with the Republican base to break party rivals. Trump\u2019s power has always been rooted in the notion that potential Republican foes cannot afford to attack him since they\u2019d alienate his supporters and ruin their own political careers. One motivation behind an early White House announcement may be to prove that\u2019s still true, as candidates like DeSantis, ex-Vice President Mike Pence, and other presidential wannabes assess his strength as they consider their own aspirations. Pence, for example \u2013 who will appear in a CNN town hall on Wednesday evening \u2013 told ABC News in an interview that aired Monday that the American people will \u201chave better choices in the future.\u201d A 2024 presidential race \u2013 with several strong potential GOP alternatives ready in the wings \u2013 will test whether Trump\u2019s magnetism with primary voters will overcome growing fatigue over his incessant 2020 election fraud lies. And it would ask GOP primary voters a question: is their devotion to the ex-president more important than worries about his capacity to actually win the White House, despite growing evidence to the contrary? So unless he has a major change of attitude, Trump \u2013 who still fumes with fury about the last presidential election in every campaign rally \u2013 will have to prove that that his false claims of a stolen election in 2020 are a winning message in 2024. Evidence suggests that while those falsehoods may still be a hot currency inside the GOP grassroots, it\u2019s a bust in a broader national electorate. \u201cYou know, if you lose over and over to what\u2019s really not that great of a team, you have got to reassess, is it time to rebuild?\u201d Maryland\u2019s Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cTrump\u2019s cost us the last three elections. And I don\u2019t want to see it happen a fourth time.\u201d Outgoing Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey effectively accused the ex-president of losing his seat. The Democratic path to Senate control ran through Pennsylvania, where Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz. With Trump\u2019s backing, Oz had narrowly prevailed over businessman David McCormick, a potentially stronger general election candidate, in the primary. \u201cAll over the country, there\u2019s a very high correlation between MAGA candidates and big losses, or at least dramatically underperforming,\u201d Toomey told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett last week. Some past and current Republican members of Congress blame Trump for party's losses, say time to move on in 2024 On Monday, Idaho GOP Rep. Mike Simpson told CNN said that while he embraced Trumpism, he had tired of Trump and didn\u2019t think he was good for the party. \u201cI think his policies were good. I just don\u2019t need all the drama with it,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers. And one of the incoming Republican House lawmakers, Mike Lawler, who picked up a Democratic seat in New York, said it was time for someone else. \u201cI would like to see the party move forward,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThis Morning\u201d last week. And in an exclusive interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Monday, outgoing Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker said that people were tired of the radicalism represented by the former president. \u201cOne of the big lessons that the Republican Party nationally needs to take away from (the midterms) is voters want collaborative elected officials. They don\u2019t want extremes,\u201d Baker said. But while there are important strategic reasons for ambitious Republicans to desert Trump, past experience suggests it would be foolish to dismiss him \u2013 even if his early launch, if it happens, could antagonize voters still exhausted by the previous election. To begin with, many of those most loudly questioning his continued dominance of the party in recent days have already broken with him in some fashion. There are few signs that more pro-Trump politicians like Cruz are pulling away. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, often spoken of as a future GOP presidential candidate, did hint that he was considering his options when he described the midterms as \u201cthe funeral for the Republican Party as we know it.\u201d The Missouri Republican, who has publicly vowed to oppose McConnell\u2019s bid for leader, called for a conversation about what the GOP can do for working class voters before the 2024 election. \u201cI like a lot of what President Trump did as president \u2026 we need to have a conversation about our core convictions. \u2026 Clearly this party is going to have to be different or we are not going to be a majority party in this country,\u201d Hawley told Capitol Hill reporters on Monday. Georgia runoff highlights GOP worries about Trump -- and excitement surrounding DeSantis But at the same time, Trumpism is actually returning to power in Washington. The likely new Republican House may only enjoy a small majority, but it would still be an overwhelmingly pro-Trump force that would relish the chance to try to thwart Biden\u2019s presidency ahead of a possible clash with his predecessor in 2024. Ambitious GOP leaders like New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, the third-ranking House Republican, have already endorsed Trump for president. If Trump is able to demonstrate he\u2019s still strong with grassroots voters, some Republicans might, as they always have before, judge that their hopes for a future in the party mean they must swallow their antipathy to the former president yet again. Felling Trump might require a candidate like DeSantis to risk his political future to try to take him out. And another crowded primary in the GOP\u2019s winner-take-all presidential race could splinter opposition to Trump and help him plot a path to the nomination. Trump has never been a cerebral, logical choice for his supporters. In 2016, he fused frustration with the globalized economy and contempt for elites to create a powerful political movement. And it goes deeper than policy. Trump offers his supporters an emotional connection. His rallies are less political speeches than raucous, politically incorrect nights out at which vast crowds relish his defiance, his embrace of their grievances and willingness to say anything, as he crushes propriety and convention. People really do want to believe what he says and not \u2013 as he famously once cautioned them against \u2013 the facts that the press reports. Attendees often look like they are having the time of their lives with a candidate who, despite serving as president for four years, has maintained the conceit that he\u2019s just one of them and not a real politician. If Trump can rekindle that feeling, he\u2019d still be a formidable force in the GOP whether or not its grandees believe he\u2019d risk losing them yet another election in 2024.",

            "article_content": "Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney endorsed Virginia Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger on Saturday, weighing in on another highly competitive House race in the final days of the midterm election campaign. Spanberger, a former CIA officer who was among the class of national security Democrats first elected in 2018, is locked in a tough contest with Republican challenger Yesli Vega to represent Virginia\u2019s 7th Congressional District. \u201cI\u2019m honored to endorse Abigail Spanberger. I have worked closely with her in Congress, and I know that she is dedicated to working across the aisle to find solutions. We don\u2019t agree on every policy, but I am absolutely certain that Abigail is dedicated to serving this country and her constituents and defending our Constitution,\u201d Cheney said in a statement. \u201cAbigail\u2019s opponent is promoting conspiracy theories, denying election outcomes she disagrees with, and defending the indefensible,\u201d she continued. The move is Cheney\u2019s latest endorsement of a member of her opposing party. The Wyoming Republican campaigned for Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin on Tuesday and endorsed her last week saying, \u201cWhile Elissa and I have our policy disagreements, at a time when our nation is facing threats at home and abroad, we need serious, responsible, substantive members like Elissa in Congress.\u201d Spanberger has campaigned on issues like infrastructure and lowering prescription drug costs, while her opponent, Vega, has said she will work to keep the Biden administration in check if elected. Virginia\u2019s 7th District House race is rated as \u201ctilt Democratic\u201d by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. CNN has reached out to Spanberger\u2019s campaign for comment on the endorsement. Cheney is leaving Congress at the end of her current term after losing the Republican primary for her at-large Wyoming seat in August. Her continued criticism of former President Donald Trump for his role in inciting the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol was seen as a key factor in her defeat. Cheney said last month that she would not remain a Republican if Trump is the GOP nominee for president in 2024.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris used a rare joint campaign appearance Friday to sharpen their warnings of a prospective Republican takeover of Congress, a closing message designed to stanch Democratic losses amid stiff political and historic headwinds. \u201cEleven days until the most important by-election in our lifetime; that\u2019s not hyperbole,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to shape what this country looks like for next decade or more. Not a joke. Let\u2019s be clear. This election is not a referendum, it\u2019s a choice. A choice between two vastly different visions of America.\u201d For Democrats, the closing stretch of the midterms has been marked by anxiety over tighter-than-expected races and fears Republicans could make major gains in November. Democrats are fighting to hold onto their narrow majority in the 50-50 Senate. Biden has spent much of his time this campaign season at official events working to promote his accomplishments, like passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill and securing passage of a massive climate and health care bill.   But his team has been frustrated that his message doesn\u2019t appear to be resonating with voters, who remain anxious about the economy and give Republicans higher marks in how they would handle issues like inflation. In the closing stretch, they have determined a tougher message on Republicans\u2019 plans could help convince voters to vote for Democrats. Biden has taken to naming Sen. Rick Scott, the Republican senate campaign chief, and Sen. Ron Johnson, for their plans on Medicare and Social Security. Biden said Friday that the measures he\u2019s been able to get passed in a narrow Senate \u2013 including lowering drug prices and expanding the Affordable Care Act \u2013 are at risk in November. \u201cThese protections will be gone as well if Republicans get their way,\u201d he said. In his speech from Philadelphia, Biden reserved some of his harshest criticism not only for Republicans but for oil executives, who he accused of lining their pockets while Americans suffer from high gas prices. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep harping on them. They talk about me picking on them. They ain\u2019t seen nothing yet. I mean it. It outrages me,\u201d he intoned. And he accused Republicans who oppose his plan to relieve up to $20,000 in student debt per eligible borrower of being hypocrites. \u201cThey\u2019re attacking middle class Americans getting a $10,000 break on the cost of their tuition? Give me a break, man. Who do they think they are?\u201d he said. And he said some Republicans \u201cseem to be hoping for a recession.\u201d Pennsylvania represents the party\u2019s best opportunity to pick up a Senate seat, with incumbent GOP Sen. Pat Toomey retiring. Biden and Harris\u2019 appearance at the Pennsylvania Democratic Party\u2019s annual Independence Dinner, a major state party fundraising event, marked the first time the President attended an event with Democratic Senate hopeful Lt. Gov. John Fetterman since his high-stakes debate performance against Republican Senate candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz earlier this week. Fetterman, who is recovering from a stroke, had an uneven performance in the debate, leading to worries among Democrats that the race could slip away. But in a conversation that was caught on camera this week, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer told Biden the debate \u201cdidn\u2019t hurt us too much.\u201d Interactive: Six states to watch for the 2022 midterms Still, a loss in Pennsylvania would sting for Democrats and Biden in particular. Friday was Biden\u2019s 19th visit to Pennsylvania since taking office, frequenting the commonwealth in a mix of official and political events in the run-up to the election, a contrast to his approach to the majority of competitive Senate races across the country. Biden was born in Pennsylvania and was known as the commonwealth\u2019s \u201cthird senator\u201d when he was a lawmaker, despite representing neighboring Delaware. He\u2019s focused more intently on the Senate race here than any other in the country. At Friday\u2019s speech, he pulled up a pantleg to show a red Phillies sock to mark the team\u2019s first night playing in the World Series. Biden is set to return to the Keystone state in the closing days of the campaign with expected appearances with his former boss, President Barack Obama, in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. Biden\u2019s 2020 rival, former President Donald Trump, is expected to campaign in Pennsylvania next weekend as well. While the President has eschewed large campaign rallies this election cycle, he has been a frequent presence on the fundraising circuit, crisscrossing the country to raise money for Democrats, including at Friday night\u2019s dinner. The fundraising reception was expected to raise $1 million. In the final week before the election, the President is set to campaign for Democrats in Florida, including Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist and Democratic Senate nominee Rep. Val Demings, as well as travel to New Mexico for events with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and other local officials. Democrats also said Biden would hold a rally in Maryland on November 7, the evening before Election Day. This story has been updated with additional details.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s plan to slash some student loan debt could help millions of borrowers but a decision he spent months wrestling over could also have profound and unpredictable electoral consequences. The cacophony that followed the administration\u2019s Wednesday announcement reflects the high-stakes issue\u2019s possible impact on the November midterm elections while also helping to explain the political, cultural and economic evolution of both major parties. The immediate effect of Biden\u2019s executive order, if it survives possible court challenges, will be alleviating some of the burden of debt for graduates who sometimes struggle to make payments or have to delay major life decisions like buying a home. Biden announces student loan relief for borrowers making less than $125,000 But no White House decision happens in a vacuum. This debate has been especially charged politically and Biden had been under extreme pressure from more liberal members of his party to take sweeping action ever since winning the election in 2020, during which he campaigned on some loan forgiveness. The proximity of the 2022 midterms, in which Democrats now hope the long-expected Republican red wave may not crest as high as feared, means the President\u2019s strategy could turn out to be especially significant. Biden supporters hailed his decision to cancel $10,000 in debt for those making less than $125,000 a year as another bold bid to improve the lives of middle class Americans, following efforts to fight child poverty and to lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors. Progressives welcomed the move but wanted more, underscoring the uneasy alliance between the White House and the left that has characterized this presidency. Some economists, meanwhile, even those who have worked in Democratic administrations, argued that canceling student debt could further spike inflation and inflate the national debt. And some education experts pointed out that while it may ease the pain of some debtors, Biden\u2019s effort does little to fix the fundamental problem \u2013 the high cost of college that prices many Americans out or leaves them laden with loans. Across the aisle, Republicans who are looking to flip the House and Senate in the fall saw a political opening in making an argument about fairness \u2013 that poorer tax-payers who didn\u2019t go to college and thus racked up no education debt essentially will end up subsidizing those who did and stand to earn more over their lifetimes. How to qualify for Biden's new student loan forgiveness plan The differing reactions on both sides of the aisle reflected a shift in the identity of the Republican and Democratic Parties. In the Donald Trump era, the GOP coalition has evolved from its country club roots and increasingly drawn from the White, blue-collar base in the industrial Midwest and the South, which once formed the bedrock of Democratic support. This is why cultural, class warfare rhetoric might work for Republicans on this issue, especially layered on top of Americans\u2019 already strong economic woes. In a simultaneous shift, Democrats have made gains among suburban and affluent professional voters who once might have preferred the GOP, but were turned off by Trump. One reason for Biden\u2019s victory, however, is that he also appealed to many working-class Americans after building his half-century-old political ethos on blue-collar families like his own in Scranton, Pennsylvania. With the midterms already being fought over the high cost of living, Biden\u2019s job approval ratings and the riotous legacy of Trump, the current President threw another controversial issue into the mix Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s about opportunity, it\u2019s about giving people a fair shot, and it\u2019s about the one word America can be defined by \u2013 possibilities,\u201d Biden said at the White House. His speech was a detailed rebuttal of many Republican arguments. He said 43 million people would benefit from the plan, 60% of whom were Pell Grant recipients. Some 45% of people could see all their student debt canceled and be able to get on top of rent and utilities, he said. Biden rejected claims the plan would hike inflation and expand the deficit and punctured Republican complaints by pointing out many of them had voted for Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cut bill, which disproportionately favored the wealthy and corporations. The President\u2019s student loan gambit won a qualified endorsement from some key figures on the left of his party. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told CNN\u2019s Bianna Golodryga that the development was \u201ctruly transformative for millions of Americans\u201d and but warned more needed to be done to tackle the cost of college. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent, said the President\u2019s decision was \u201can important step forward\u201d but that it didn\u2019t go far enough at a moment of gaping wealth inequality. Both Sanders and Warren made canceling much larger slices of student debt a cornerstone of their 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaigns and the pressure that Biden felt to act was a validation of their strategies. Student debt relief is a tourniquet \u2014 not a magic bullet His move could stoke turnout among young voters this fall who had soured on Democrats, who, in recent elections have appealed to young college-educated voters and young suburban families. A higher ceiling of $20,000 dollars in debt cancellation available to graduates from low-income families who used Pell Grants for college could energize minority voters in swing states. But the President\u2019s move was still a relatively small step, another example of how his compromises have delivered less for the Democratic monopoly on political power in Washington than progressives had hoped. That disappointment is most clearly illustrated in the way the vast Build Back Better Act, which would have fundamentally overhauled education and health and home care, shrunk to the smaller Inflation Reduction Act concentrating on cutting prescription drugs prices for Medicare patients and combating climate change. And the enthusiasm gap could remain an issue for Democrats if their liberal base is peeved that Biden did not answer their calls for a much higher or total debt cancellation. The sensitivity of Biden\u2019s move was, meanwhile, underscored by the tepid reaction that it drew from some Democrats in tight midterm races. Rep. Tim Ryan, the Democratic nominee for Senate in Ohio, complained that it \u201csends the wrong message to the millions of Ohioans without a degree working just as hard to make ends meet.\u201d Ryan, who\u2019s running in a rust belt state Trump has twice won, called instead for a tax cut for working and middle class families and more opportunities for student borrowers to refinance their loans. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who is facing a potentially competitive reelection this fall, said the debt relief should have been more targeted and that he wished the administration had \u201cproposed a way to pay for this plan\u201d \u2013 a nod to the economic concerns Republicans are already seizing on. While acknowledging that \u201cimmediate relief to families is important,\u201d he called for systemic reforms to cut the \u201cabsurd\u201d cost of a degree and an attempt to build economic security for Americans who do not get a two- or four-year college degree. For Republicans, the decision could be a chance to activate a working-class base, including many voters who may not be college graduates and will not benefit from what the GOP is branding as a government bailout for the elite. Mitch McConnell, the GOP leader in the Senate, laid out a rhetorical checklist for his candidates, warning the plan would worsen inflation, reward far-left activists and do nothing for millions of struggling families. He sought to enlist every taxpayer who will not benefit from loan cancellation as a critic. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s student loan socialism is a slap in the face to every family who sacrificed to save for college, every graduate who paid their debt, and every American who chose a certain career path or volunteered to serve in our Armed Forces in order to avoid taking on debt. This policy is astonishingly unfair.\u201d What Biden's student debt plan will do to the US economy While arguing that the plan represented socialism \u2013 a doctrine that, among other aims, prioritizes the working class over the rich \u2013 the Kentucky Republican also argued that Biden had set out to reward the most wealthy. \u201cDemocrats specifically wrote this policy to make sure that people earning six figures would benefit,\u201d McConnell said. Republican Sen. Ben Sasse accused the President of spinning the debt cancellation program with \u201cPell window dressing\u201d to disguise the way that it \u201cforces blue-collar workers to subsidize white-collar graduate students.\u201d The Nebraskan also identified one of the great omissions of the President\u2019s approach in that it does not do much to fundamentally reform an education system that sees the cost of college soar year after year and makes it even harder for people from working-class backgrounds to access the social mobility pipeline that often comes with an advanced degree. That kind of transformation is beyond a president wielding executive power and needs an act of Congress. But the hyper-politicized reaction on both sides to Biden\u2019s announcement shows that higher education \u2013 like many other challenges \u2013 is yet another issue that is beyond the capacity of a divided nation to fix.",

            "article_content": "In the fight to control the Senate, Democrats and Republicans are staring at equally uncertain, yet markedly different, paths to the majority. Republican candidates are enjoying a favorable political environment, defined by an unpopular Democratic president presiding over a time of notably high inflation. But Senate Republicans have jeopardized those benefits with a stable of high-risk candidates in key races, backing a series of Republicans who present serious messaging challenges and have yet to show any real fundraising prowess. Democrats face the opposite challenge. While the party in power is weighed down by President Joe Biden\u2019s anemic approval rating and the overarching sense among voters that America is going in the wrong direction, it has backed a series of well-funded and disciplined candidates, many of whom are using their impressive fundraising advantage to put themselves in a better position than the national atmosphere would suggest. Whether that will last until November is an open question, with even buoyant Democratic strategists acknowledging their fortunes could change once voters begin paying more attention to politics in the fall. The national mood has put Democrats on the defensive, as they look to hold on to vulnerable seats in Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and New Hampshire, compete for open seats in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Ohio and to unseat Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin. But Republican operatives working on a series of Senate races appear more dour of late, with some admitting their candidates have yet to take advantage of the helpful environment, allowing their Democratic opponents to stand out, raise money and prepare. \u201cSome of these candidates need to get their sh*t together,\u201d said a Republican working on Senate races. \u201cThey are potentially putting at risk very winnable seats.\u201d To Republicans looking for a wave election in November, the margin for error is slim. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 With the Senate currently split 50-50, Republicans need only to net one seat in 2022 to win a majority. But they are defending the majority of seats up for election in November, and several of the Democratic seats they\u2019re targeting are in states where Biden won in 2020, including Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. \u201cI\u2019m upbeat and optimistic,\u201d said Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist. \u201cBut the Democrats\u2019 fundraising [advantage] is concerning. You would think big GOP donors would learn by now that elections have consequences.\u201d The uncertainty belies the fact that a whole host of data points are trending in Republicans\u2019 favor. The latest CNN poll finds just 38% of adults approve of Biden, with 30% approving of his handling of the economy and just 25% of his handling of inflation, which has reached a four-decade-plus high. The same CNN poll found 75% of adults say inflation is the most important economic problem affecting them. Even more ominous for Democrats is how voters feel about the state of the country. In an AP-NORC survey released in late June, 85% of American adults said that things in the country are headed in the wrong direction, with just 14% believing things are going in the right direction, a more pessimistic view than the same survey found in May. And a CNN poll released this week found voters are evenly split on which party\u2019s candidates they\u2019d prefer in their congressional districts, with 46% picking the Democrats and 46% the Republicans. \u201cThe generic ballot is better than it\u2019s ever been, the issue set is the best it\u2019s ever been, the President\u2019s approval rating is the worst there\u2019s ever been,\u201d said one Republican strategist. \u201cThat\u2019s the definition of holding serve.\u201d While the current standing among some Republicans has given Democratic operatives hope in what will be a trying midterm election, many admit it is unlikely that the good news will continue into November. \u201cOur candidates continue to perform well because they recognize this is an economy where a lot of people are feeling burdened,\u201d said JB Poersch, president of the Democratic Senate Majority PAC. \u201cYou have to be able to point to things you are doing to try to make it better. \u2026 A lot of Americans are suffering and they want to hear from elected officials and people who want to be elected officials on what they are doing to make it better.\u201d Republican leaders remain anxious that some of the party\u2019s current or potential nominees risk erasing the party\u2019s environmental advantages. The GOP failed to find top-tier recruits to challenge some vulnerable Democratic incumbents, and in certain races, candidates boosted by an endorsement from former President Donald Trump in the primary defeated Republicans seen as more viable in a general election. \u201cPoor candidate recruitment and some lackluster campaigns will really test whether or not this cycle is foolproof for Republicans,\u201d said a second GOP strategist. \u201cIn most other cycles, there\u2019s probably little chance to flip the Senate at this point.\u201d And no candidate showcases those fears more than Mehmet Oz, the celebrity doctor and television personality who narrowly won his party\u2019s nomination in May with Trump\u2019s backing but has struggled to impress Republicans both in and out of Pennsylvania ever since. \u201cI still think Oz probably wins, but the public and private poll numbers are not encouraging,\u201d said one GOP strategist in Pennsylvania. Oz\u2019s struggles have been both financial and rhetorical. The Republican raised a disappointing $3.8 million in the second quarter of the year, while his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, raised $11 million despite spending the past two months off the trail and recovering from a stroke. Oz has contributed $3.2 million to his campaign in the last three months. Democratic Senate contenders smash fundraising records as Donald Trump's cash pace slows And with Fetterman off the trail, his campaign has ruthlessly attacked the fact that Oz only recently moved to Pennsylvania to run for Senate. When Oz visited two cheesesteak spots in South Philadelphia, Fetterman tweeted that the visit was in line with what all tourists do in the city. The campaign has also released a string of ads showing Fetterman lambasting Oz for his weak ties to Pennsylvania, including one in which the lieutenant governor says Oz \u201cis not one of us.\u201d And they have had fun with his ties to New Jersey, including by releasing a trolling Cameo video from the Jersey Shore star Snookie \u2013 real name: Nicole Polizzi \u2013 that wished \u201cMehmet\u201d luck with his decision to move \u201cfrom New Jersey to Pennsylvania to look for a new job\u201d and assured him that \u201cJersey will not forget you.\u201d \u201cWe like to have fun with the New Jersey thing, but it is not just that he is from New Jersey. He is not one of us, he is not a Pennsylvanian,\u201d said Joe Calvello, a Fetterman spokesman. \u201cHe does not understand the struggles that Pennsylvanians are going through. \u2026 It goes deeper than that.\u201d While Oz has begun to respond to Fetterman\u2019s attacks with online videos criticizing the Democrat\u2019s progressive views, the poor fundraising remains a problem, according to top Republicans. GOP operatives in the state say the race will hinge on the air war in the expensive Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Harrisburg markets, making raising money crucially important. According to a political ad-spending analysis by AdImpact, campaigns and super PACs from both parties in Pennsylvania already spent more than $78 million on ads before the May 17 Senate primaries. \u201cIf Oz is not going to write another very large check, then that fundraising needs to get fixed,\u201d said a second Pennsylvania-based Republican strategist. The Oz campaign disputed those characterizations, pointing out that the Republican has been meeting with voters in stops across the state this summer and claiming he will have plenty of funds for the general election. \u201cJust like in the primary, Dr. Oz\u2019s campaign will also have ample resources to get its message out,\u201d said Brittany Yanick, a spokeswoman for Oz. \u201cDr. Oz has been busy campaigning across the state, meeting with voters, and attending both small dollar and high dollar fundraising events, but Fetterman refuses to campaign and meet with voters who are concerned about the disastrous Biden-Fetterman agenda.\u201d But Oz is not alone in worrying Republican leaders. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia remains a top target, but Republican nominee Herschel Walker has been dogged by personal and political liabilities, a string of verbal gaffes, and an unfocused campaign strategy. Even Walker\u2019s recent fundraising haul \u2013 $6.2 million, his best quarter yet \u2013 paled in comparison to Warnock\u2019s $17.2 million raised in the same quarter. The hope is that a recent infusion of new communications and financial staff, many of whom come with national campaign experience, will right the ship and take attention off Walker\u2019s numerous controversies, which include his false claim that he graduated near the top of his class in college and his admission that he has three previously undisclosed children. But Republicans remain concerned that one of their best chances to pick up a seat in the Senate could be imperiled. And in Missouri, an otherwise deep-red state, supporters of some of the other Republican candidates are scrambling to prevent a leading contender, former Gov. Eric Greitens, from winning the nomination in the August 2 primary and putting their hold on the seat at greater risk. Greitens resigned as governor in 2018 after a series of ethical controversies and accusations of sexual misconduct. The Republican did not admit to any legal wrongdoing and criminal charges against him were dropped, but an anti-Greitens super PAC has spent more than $3 million on TV ads highlighting those scandals. \u201cThese Senate races are candidate vs. candidate battles,\u201d said David Bergstein, a top operative with the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cSenate Republicans are running with a clown car roster of recruits that are bringing deep personal and political flaws to the campaigns and the baggage that these Republican Senate candidates have, which have been front and center of the last several months, will continue to be a defining feature of Senate campaigns this cycle.\u201d Trump-backed Arizona Senate candidate escalates election fears ahead of GOP primary Republicans are also watching closely the Senate race in Arizona, where Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly has a massive fundraising advantage while the GOP candidates have had to focus on the upcoming August 2 primary. Republican leaders like Sen. Mitch McConnell tried and failed to recruit the outgoing governor, Doug Ducey, to run for the seat. Without Ducey, the crowded field seems to be settling on tech entepreneur Blake Masters, who received Trump\u2019s endorsement. But Republicans recognize that since Trump narrowly lost Arizona in 2020, the state has only moved further toward the Democratic Party. \u201cWinning Arizona will not be an easy proposition for Republicans,\u201d said a July memo from a prominent Republican consultant distributed among party leaders and donors. Next door in Nevada, there is more optimism among Republicans that Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto has failed to make enough of a good impression in her first term and that the GOP nominee, former state attorney general Adam Laxalt, can ride the wave of a good Republican year in a state where Trump improved his performance from 2016 to 2020. And Republicans say they feel more confident about defending their own seats in Wisconsin, where Johnson is in a good position, and in North Carolina, where GOP nominee Ted Budd is well-funded and polling well in his bid to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr. But Republicans are also frustrated they are not able to better compete in New Hampshire, where Sen. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat, remains vulnerable this year. After failing to recruit Gov. Chris Sununu to challenge Hassan, the GOP field there is not inspiring party leaders ahead of the September 13 primary. Few Democrats are defying gravity more than Rep. Tim Ryan, the party\u2019s nominee to replace retiring Republican Sen. Rob Portman in a state that largely has been dominated by Republicans for years. Ryan raised $9.1 million in the second quarter of 2022, dwarfing the abysmal $1 million from Republican author J.D. Vance, who, like Oz, won the state\u2019s primary with Trump\u2019s backing earlier in the year. And while Vance has spent much of the summer off the campaign trail, Ryan is airing ads that portray him as a Democrat who wins praise from top Republicans and casting himself as just as mad about Democratic leadership in Washington as many voters across Ohio. For now, the strategy is keeping Ryan afloat in a state that some Democrats had long written off. But Ryan aides are aware that the good times may not last forever. \u201cWe feel really good,\u201d said a top Ryan aide, \u201cBut we are by no means getting complacent.\u201d This is partially because as strong as Ryan\u2019s run has been this summer, the national atmosphere is a lot for any Democrat to contend with, but especially a Democrat running in a state where, other than Sen. Sherrod Brown, no Democrat has won a nonjudicial statewide office since 2008. And even though former President Barack Obama carried the state in 2008 and 2012, his successor, Trump, carried the state in 2016 and 2020. \u201cWe are not campaigning in a vacuum,\u201d the aide added. \u201cYou can\u2019t completely factor it out. But being able to show that you understand what people are going through\u2026 I do think people see and hear that and counts something for them.\u201d Other top Democrats agree: The standing of Democratic candidates has been better than many expected over the last few months, but it is still only July and there will be, as one top Senate aide said, a \u201cconstant push and pull this cycle between the national environment and the dynamics in individual races.\u201d \u201cWe have been on a really good run recently,\u201d the aide said. \u201cThe core map remains Arizona, Georgia, New Hampshire, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina. But there are certainly strong campaigns and potential areas to expand in states like Florida and Ohio, and certainly we are watching other states as well.\u201d",

            "article_content": "White House economic adviser Jared Bernstein told CNN on Sunday that President Joe Biden will pursue his climate agenda \u201cwith or without Congress,\u201d following the news Thursday that West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin wouldn\u2019t back climate or tax provisions in his party\u2019s budget reconciliation package. \u201cI think the President is very much, and very compelled to get Congress to work with him on his climate agenda. He\u2019s already taken unprecedented action, and I think this is important because if he can\u2019t find a legislative path to clean energy, the urgency of the problem is so significant that, as he said on Friday, he will find an executive order and rule change path to get there,\u201d Bernstein told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Biden said Friday during his trip to the Middle East that he would take \u201cstrong executive action\u201d in response to Manchin walking away from a deal to address the climate crisis, citing concerns over spending and inflation. Democrats fumble on the climate crisis again as US suffers consequences of inaction \u201cInflation is absolutely killing many, many people. They can\u2019t buy gasoline.

Can\u2019t we wait to make sure we do nothing to add to that?\u201d Bernstein on Sunday listed a series of steps the administration has already taken to address the climate crisis, including invoking the Defense Production Act to increase clean energy output, restoring emissions standards rolled back by the Trump administration and ramping up offshore wind energy production. \u201cHe will continue to pursue that, with or without Congress, but the urgency of the issue, Dana, is, I think, it is beyond me how anyone could miss it,\u201d he told Bash. Still, Bernstein touted provisions in the Senate Democrats\u2019 compromise legislation that he said \u201cgives Americans a little bit of breathing room\u201d by lowering the cost of prescription drugs and health care. Also Sunday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders slammed Manchin for throwing a wrench in the effort to pass the social spending bill, saying, \u201cHe didn\u2019t abruptly do anything.\u201d \u201cThe problem was that we continue to talk to Manchin like he was serious. He was not,\u201d Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Senate Democrats, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d When asked about what\u2019s at stake for the climate agenda if the provisions in Democrats\u2019 bill don\u2019t pass, Sanders responded, \u201cIt ain\u2019t Democrats. It isn\u2019t the President. It is the future of the planet.\u201d \u201cWhat this election must be about is whether or not we\u2019re going to vote for candidates who are prepared to stand up for working people, stand up for the planet and have the courage to take on the billionaire class who dominates our economy and our political life,\u201d he added, emphasizing the need to elect more progressives. Meanwhile, Bernstein defended the President\u2019s decision to meet \u2013 and fist bump \u2013 with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during their meeting Friday, telling Bash that, as an economic policy adviser, \u201cI\u2019m much more able to give you fulsome readout on meetings, not greetings\u201d and that last week\u2019s meeting in Saudi Arabia \u201cis very much part of\u201d the administration\u2019s efforts to convince the kingdom to increase oil production capacity. 5 takeaways from Biden's first presidential trip to the Middle East \u201cWe saw Saudi Arabia say that it would increase its capacity for oil production, and I refer you to them for more information there, but remember, Saudi Arabia is part of, of course, a part of OPEC, part of the cartel,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cAnd the President has been, and other, some of our other members of our foreign policy team have been pressuring OPEC to increase production. And in fact, a few weeks ago, they talked about doing precisely that for July and August, increasing production by about 50%.\u201d National security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters earlier that the administration was \u201chopeful\u201d OPEC would commit to additional actions aimed at increasing oil output \u201cin the coming weeks,\u201d and that Biden and OPEC leaders would discuss the issue while in Saudi Arabia last week.

            "article_content": "Britain\u2019s Conservatives just did what America\u2019s Republicans never dared to do. They toppled a wrecking ball right-wing populist leader who reeled from one self-created scandal to another and who was accused of flagrantly breaking the law, abusing power and building his political career on an edifice of lies. After weeks of clinging desperately to office, Boris Johnson finally resigned as the ruling Conservative Party\u2019s leader Thursday after a rebellion by his own lawmakers. The party will elect a new leader, who, according to the customs of Britain\u2019s parliamentary system, will become prime minister. America\u2019s Republican Party, however, never turned on Donald Trump in the same way \u2013 despite his far more ruinous offenses against democracy than Johnson\u2019s. It\u2019s not that Republicans didn\u2019t have the chance. The ex-President was impeached twice, but most GOP senators chose not to vote to convict him of high crimes and misdemeanors last year \u2013 a step that could have barred him from future federal office. Boris Johnson rose from joker to statesman. Scandals of his own making brought him down The contrasting fates of Johnson and Trump come down to personal factors, electoral politics and the idiosyncrasies in the political systems of two nations. Johnson was long seen as a vote-winning machine. He was the talismanic figure who won a referendum in 2016 that led to Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Then, in a general election in late 2019, he delivered an extraordinary victory for the Conservatives \u2013 capturing post-industrial working-class heartlands in England and Wales that had long been the left-wing Labour Party\u2019s power base. But Johnson was the author of his own demise. His appeal ruptured over revelations that he had attended parties in 10 Downing Street after ordering his country into Covid-19 lockdowns. That\u2019s why the Conservatives \u2013 who have a long record of mutinying against leaders seen as an electoral liability \u2013 finally pounced. A similar fate befell the party\u2019s most successful modern leader, Margaret Thatcher, in 1990 and her successor, John Major, went on to win a general election. Johnson\u2019s orchestration of the Brexit shocker \u2013 after a campaign lambasting the European establishment and inciting a working-class revolt \u2013 was in retrospect seen as an early warning sign of Trump\u2019s even more stunning victory, when he won the presidency on a similar tide of populism a few months later. Trump and Johnson have long been seen as two peas in a pod \u2013 and not just because of their strong sense of victimhood and refusal to take responsibility for their transgressions on the way out of office. Boris Johnson leaves world's fifth biggest economy in crisis Both have turbulent romantic histories, both rose to power on the force of untamed personalities and have distant acquaintances with the truth. Both often appeared to prioritize their own goals and craving to satisfy massive political egos over the national interest. And both tried to cling to office \u2013 Trump after losing an election and Johnson as his party deserted him \u2013 long after it was obvious they were on the way out. Still, personal comparisons between Johnson and the other golden-haired rule breaker on this side of the Atlantic have generally been overblown, even if both weaponized resentment against elites to win power. Despite his extraordinary success in winning over blue-collar voters, much as Trump did with rust-belt blue-collar Democrats, Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson is hardly anti-establishment. Exceedingly well-read and a talented writer, Johnson came through Britain\u2019s pipeline to power \u2013 from exclusive private school Eton and Balliol College at Oxford University. It\u2019s unlikely Johnson would have survived a lifetime of scrapes were it not for the class deference embedded in British public life and the sense of entitlement his upbringing instilled in him. Trump, in contrast, has never moved in high society or felt comfortable in the club the way Johnson has. The key to his bond with voters who felt themselves left out of the American dream was that he understood what it was to be spurned by elites \u2013 in his case by Manhattan old money that saw him as vulgar. What happens when a British Prime Minister resigns? But both Trump and the man he once called \u201cBritain Trump\u201d have shown how a country\u2019s political system can melt down when their creed of government by chaos gains uncontrollable momentum. No one could credibly argue that Britain \u2013 facing high inflation, the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic and rising industrial unrest \u2013 has been governed in any sense of the term in recent weeks. Johnson\u2019s personal dramas overwhelmed everything. And he\u2019s shown personal contempt for the rule of law. That same sense of a nation spinning out of control was felt in the US during Trump\u2019s chaotic leadership during the pandemic in summer 2020 and as he tried to steal power in late 2020 and early 2021 and triggered the US Capitol insurrection. The reason why Trump survived and Johnson didn\u2019t lies in the extraordinary power of the ex-President over rank-and-file Republican voters and the fact that a presidential candidate\u2019s first job is to lock in support from primary voters. Johnson lost much of his party. While Trump has not managed to dictate the midterm election primary season as closely as he would like, the ex-President is yet to experience a similar revolt. Trump weighs early 2024 launch as January 6 committee looms over his future Most GOP lawmakers understand they must effectively support, enable and shield Trump if they want a future political career because of his magnetic hold over the Republican base. Even now, as scary details emerge from a House select committee\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s coup attempt in 2021, the ex-President remains the favorite for the 2024 Republican nomination. In Republican politics at least, Trump is still an electoral asset. British Tory MPs, however \u2013 already worried about Johnson\u2019s splintered reputation among a general election audience \u2013 feared they would lose their seats if they kept him in power. Johnson tried to insist on Thursday he had a mandate from the British people and condemned the \u201cherd\u201d of Conservative lawmakers who finally ended his career. But his complaint didn\u2019t hold up because prime ministers are accountable to parliament \u2013 and are not directly elected by voters in the way that presidents are every four years. Despite the ex-President\u2019s enduring strength in his party, it\u2019s not impossible that Johnson\u2019s demise is yet again an early warning system for Trump. Jan. 6 committee revelations may give Republicans opening to take on Trump in 2024 Johnson only survived this long because his party saw him as its best chance of winning power. But when his secret sauce with voters dried up, he was vulnerable. There are many Republican voters who will never desert the ex-President. But Trump\u2019s biggest challenge going forward may lie in the possibility that even some Republicans who voted for him in the past come to believe that another America First-style candidate with more discipline and less personal drama may be more likely to beat the Democrats in 2024. This possible scenario is one reason why the political stock of Ron DeSantis has been rising fast \u2013 though it\u2019s unclear whether the Florida governor would risk taking on Trump in a primary. Watching the downfall of a truth-challenged, populist rule breaker with whom he has long identified cannot have been a pleasant experience for the former President. \u201cAs we have seen at Westminster \u2026 when the herd moves, it moves. And my friends, in politics, no one is remotely indispensable,\u201d Johnson said on Thursday as he announced his resignation as Conservative leader. If he is to win back the White House in 2024, Trump will have to resist a similar political force.",

            "article_content": "Pennsylvania state Rep. Summer Lee will win the fiercely contested Democratic primary for the 12th Congressional District, CNN projected Thursday, overcoming an onslaught of outside money to narrowly defeat her moderate rival, attorney Steve Irwin. As of Thursday morning, with nearly all of the votes counted, Lee\u2019s lead over Irwin was less than a percentage point. The Pittsburgh-area race to succeed retiring Democratic Rep. Mike Doyle, who had endorsed Irwin, has been one of the most expensive House primaries in the country so far. A pair of pro-Israel groups spent more than $3 million opposing Lee, who is vying to become to the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania. Lee, a labor and Democratic Party organizer before she first ran for office in 2018, has defied the odds before. She unseated a longtime incumbent to win her statehouse seat in 2018 and was recruited by the progressive group Justice Democrats to run for the seat Doyle is vacating. Lee was bolstered by Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party, but her allies \u2013 which spent about $1.4 million on her behalf \u2013 were outstripped by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s new super PAC, United Democracy Project, and Democratic Majority for Israel. But in the end, Lee, who was endorsed by a variety of local groups, Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey and progressive leaders such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, secured a narrow victory. \u201cThey hit us with everything they had, we clawed and we ran, and we got the power of the people,\u201d Lee said on election night earlier this month. \u201cWe\u2019re out here in Western Pennsylvania fighting for the future of the whole country.\u201d Her success delivers a hit of adrenaline to the progressive movement, which saw two of its allies lose open-seat races in North Carolina after facing a similar surge in outside spending. In Pittsburgh, though, the backlash to the attacks on Lee was especially heated. In an interview days before the primary, Lee called the volume of spending against her \u201cobscene\u201d and said it was intended \u201cto send a very specific message: not just that we\u2019re trying to win an election, but we\u2019re trying to destroy you, we\u2019re trying to depress voter turnout and we\u2019re trying to discourage voters.\u201d Attacks paid for by outside groups targeting Lee\u2019s alleged disloyalty to the Democratic Party prompted a joint reply from local officials, including Gainey, who sent an open letter to Irwin\u2019s campaign urging him to condemn the attacks. \u201cAs Democrats from across the commonwealth, we find it shameful that you would team up with a corporate super PAC that has endorsed over 100+ pro-insurrectionist Republicans to attack and smear our Democratic colleague, state Rep. Summer Lee, as not a Democrat,\u201d the Lee supporters wrote. Irwin\u2019s campaign defended the content of the ads and the group making them, with a spokesman telling the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review at the time that \u201cIrwin is proud to stand up for the Jewish state of Israel and America\u2019s strongest ally in the Middle East.\u201d On election night, with Lee leading and her allies confident she would prevail, Justice Democrats executive director Alexandra Rojas took a victory lap. \u201cThis is a resounding defeat against Republican-funded Super PACs and the corporate-friendly establishment,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cDemocratic voters don\u2019t want to be sold corporate millionaire candidates, they want working-class progressive leaders that will build a people-powered movement for everybody.\u201d Top officials from the groups that spent the most to defeat Lee, United Democracy Project and Democratic Majority for Israel, said their efforts had been successful in keeping the race close and pointed to Lee\u2019s standing in the district before they got involved in the race as the decisive factor. \u201cSummer Lee is an exceptional candidate and was already an elected official who generated millions of dollars from super PACs and individuals,\u201d DMFI PAC president Mark Mellman told CNN. \u201cHer losing what EMILY\u2019s List\u2019s pollster called a \u2018commanding\u2019 25-point lead, sends a message about her politics that is perhaps more salient than her long predicted victory.\u201d Patrick Dorton, a spokesman for United Democracy Project, said Lee\u2019s narrow victory was evidence that her views did \u201cnot resonate with a huge chunk of the Democratic Party,\u201d adding that the AIPAC-sponsored group is \u201cevaluating 10-15 other races\u201d involving candidates it views as threats to the US-Israel relationship. Notably, though, neither group made the domestic debate over Israel policy a focus of their ad blitz against Lee. J Street, a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group, which has denounced AIPAC\u2019s support for Republican lawmakers who voted against certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 election win, called Lee a \u201cprincipled progressive\u201d and warned against similar efforts to influence Democratic campaigns. \u201cThis kind of overwhelming outside spending \u2013 driven by a hawkish, right-wing foreign policy agenda that is completely out of touch with most Democratic voters \u2013 deeply challenges the underpinnings of America\u2019s political system,\u201d J Street President Jeremy Ben-Ami said in a statement.

            "article_content": "John Fetterman will win the Pennsylvania Democratic Senate primary, CNN projects, capping a bizarre final few days of the campaign after the lieutenant governor suffered a stroke last week. Fetterman checked into a hospital in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, on Friday as he was on his way to a campaign event. He was found to have had a stroke. Fetterman has been in the hospital ever since, and he underwent a nearly three-hour surgery on Tuesday to implant a pacemaker that includes a defibrillator. Fetterman \u2013 surrounded by his dad, brother and his campaign manager \u2013 watched the results come in from his hospital, while his supporters gathered in Pittsburgh to cheer the win, look toward the general election and listen to a speech from Gisele Barreto Fetterman, the candidate\u2019s wife. Gisele Barreto Fetterman told CNN that President Joe Biden phoned her husband to congratulate him after his win, but the candidate was asleep after his surgery hours earlier. She took the call instead and said Biden offered congratulations, wished her husband a speedy recovery and said he couldn\u2019t wait to support him in the closely watched race in November. While the hospital stay injected a level of uncertainty into the race, Fetterman had long been the front-runner, holding a steady polling lead over US Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta. And nearly all Pennsylvania Democratic voters who CNN spoke to in the final days of the campaign \u2013 including when Fetterman was in the hospital \u2013 said the stroke would not change their vote. For the lieutenant governor, who lost in the primary when he ran for US Senate in 2016, the win is the cap on a high-profile rise from small-town mayor to statewide elected official. Fetterman served as mayor of Braddock, a small town near Pittsburgh, from 2006 to 2019, when he became lieutenant governor. Fetterman is difficult to pin down politically and looks nothing like a traditional politician, something that set him apart from his primary opponents. The candidate is often described as a progressive populist and holds positions that span the spectrum of the Democratic Party: He opposed the defund the police effort, made legalizing marijuana central to his time as lieutenant governor and backed universal health care plans. But Fetterman told CNN in April that he was not a liberal. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to nitpick, but I wouldn\u2019t categorize myself as progressive,\u201d Fetterman told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cI consider myself a Democrat that\u2019s running on the same platform of ideas that every other Democrat in this race is running on. And I can\u2019t think of a Democrat running nationally that\u2019s running on anything functionally different in that regard.\u201d Fetterman has also said Senate candidates in Pennsylvania are \u201cgoing to embrace Joe Biden.\u201d Fetterman\u2019s uniqueness goes beyond being rhetorical. Standing at 6-foot, 8 inches and better known for wearing shorts and Carhartt hoodies than ties and suits, Fetterman\u2019s unique look has set him apart on the national stage, endearing him to his most loyal supporters. A Biden adviser told CNN on Tuesday that \u201cthere are big similarities between John Fetterman and Joe Biden,\u201d including a focus on organizing, an appeal to working class voters and a concern for unions. Where they differ, the adviser added, \u201cYou cannot compare with their Republican opponents.\u201d Plus, the adviser joked, \u201cI saw the President walking around in shorts and a Carhartt earlier.\u201d Whether Fetterman\u2019s appeal can help Democrats win back blue-collar voters who have left the party in recent years remains an open question. And Lamb, his top primary opponent, made questioning Fetterman\u2019s ability to reach these voters central to his campaign. \u201cThose people don\u2019t care how we dress. They\u2019re not going to make their decision based on how we dress. They\u2019re going to make it based on issues,\u201d Lamb told CNN days before the primary. \u201cI\u2019m someone who you know can beat Republicans in these high-stakes situations cause I\u2019ve done it three times. He never has.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reaction. CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A win for John Fetterman in Pennsylvania on Tuesday would be a win for the unconventional candidate. Scores of Fetterman supporters across the commonwealth were drawn to the candidate because of his uniqueness. They loved that he looked miserable at a White House event, has people not-entirely-jokingly guessing whether he owns a suit and literally stands out of a crowd with his 6-foot, 8-inch frame. His stances drew them in, too, from legal marijuana to climate justice to his focus on \u201cforgotten areas\u201d throughout Pennsylvania. But with Fetterman on the precipice of winning the Democratic Senate primary \u2013 polls show the lieutenant governor up around 30 percentage points over Rep. Conor Lamb and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta \u2013 many of those same supporters have a dilemma: Is the lieutenant governor too unique for a broader electorate? It is not an uncommon question among both the Fetterman faithful and even some Republicans drawn to his persona. His supporters still love him. \u201cVery few politicians feel like that they are going to go to war for you,\u201d said Andrew Charles, who attended a recent Fetterman event in homemade T-shirts supporting the candidate. \u201cThey feel like they have their own agenda and John\u2019s agenda seems like it\u2019s for the people instead of for money of big business.\u201d But with Democrats\u2019 sole goal being winning in November \u2013 flipping the open Senate seat is key to the party retaining control of the chamber \u2013 some have begun to question whether the same uniqueness that drew them in is what will turn off a broader, more politically diverse set of voters. \u201cI know that John Fetterman does own a suit. I have seen him in it. \u2026 And I know he has a wife who tells him from time to time, \u2018John, you need to put on the suit,\u2019 \u201d said Jen Porter, an active Democrat who had already cast her ballot for Fetterman. \u201cBut he is unconventional. \u2026 I hope that would not be held against him.\u201d Karin Tatela, an educator at the event, said when she had to tell a friend about the Fetterman appearance she was going to, the comparison she used was to a long-haired, tattooed rocker: Bo Bice, the runner up on the fourth season of American Idol who lost to Carrie Underwood. \u201cWhen I was texting my friend this morning that I was coming, I said he is the Bo Bice of politics,\u201d said Tatela, who wondered whether that uniqueness could hurt him in the long run. \u201cThat\u2019s my one reservation, because I want somebody that can beat the Republicans.\u201d Fetterman\u2019s campaign is now in a unique position with a unique candidate. Fetterman announced on Sunday that he had a stroke on Friday, sidelining him from the campaign trail for multiple days while he recovers in a Lancaster area hospital. The candidate says his doctors have \u201cassured me that I\u2019ll be able to get back on the trail\u201d and that there was no \u201ccognitive damage\u201d done by the stroke, but the injection of a health issue just days before the primary throws yet another question into what will likely be one of the most closely watched Senate campaigns of the 2022 cycle. \u201cIt was certainly a shock,\u201d said Porter, who was at the Lancaster-area event that Fetterman was meant to attend before he checked himself into the hospital. Her support of Fetterman is not diminished \u2013 \u201cI am putting out signs at my precinct in my district tomorrow, she said \u2013 but Porter worries the stroke could become an issue in a general election. \u201cPolitics is so dirty these days,\u201d she said. \u201cI think the Republican could uses it as an issue. I don\u2019t think they should, but I think they could.\u201d The lieutenant governor entered the race as a formidable candidate, but no one thought he would so easily dispatch Lamb, a more traditional Democrat who has racked up endorsement after endorsement but whose campaign has failed to ever launch. The Fetterman campaign announced on Friday that they had more than 200,000 individual donors, an impressive feat that helps explain why Lamb was so easily swatted away: The lieutenant governor has broad Democratic appeal. But, should he win on Tuesday, Fetterman will have to face a wider swath of voters, not just Democrats eager to vote in a primary. And that is where the fact that he doesn\u2019t look like a traditional politician could become more complicated. \u201cHe definitely is a different kind of candidate,\u201d said Tracy Rekus, a Scranton-area voter who used to vote for Democrats but now plans to back Republican Kathy Barnette in the Republican primary. But Rekus exemplifies the complications that a unique candidate like Fetterman will face. She supports the legalization of marijuana, but she also \u201cwasn\u2019t a fan of the flags that he put out in front of his office,\u201d referring to a flag with a marijuana symbol he hung outside his office in Harrisburg. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to show it in front of the people\u2019s house,\u201d she added. Lamb has also tried to cut into the idea that Fetterman\u2019s persona will help him at all with more working class, rural voters that Democrats need to win to cut into Republican margins in large swaths of the state. \u201cThose people don\u2019t care how we dress. They\u2019re not going to make their decision based on how we dress. They\u2019re going to make it based on issues,\u201d Lamb told CNN recently, arguing that what he believes \u201cdistinguishes our two campaigns is I\u2019m willing to talk about swing voters in this state and who they are and what it takes to appeal to them, and John\u2019s never had to do that.\u201d Lamb\u2019s argument is also that Fetterman is too progressive to win in a state like Pennsylvania, something a super PAC supporting the congressman has driven home by regularly calling the lieutenant governor a socialist. That messaging resonates for lean Republican voters like Sharon Brooks, a Bucks County resident who voted for former President Barack Obama twice before voting for former President Donald Trump twice. \u201cI believe he is too progressive. Conor Lamb is much more of a centrist than John Fetterman. If I had to vote Democrat, I\u2019d vote for Conor,\u201d said Brooks, who is deciding between voting for Barnette and celebrity Dr. Mehmet Oz in the Republican primary. This is not Fetterman\u2019s first run for Senate or the first time his uniqueness has been a question headed into an election day \u2013 he ran and lost in 2016 to Democrat Katie McGinty. McGinty\u2019s primary campaign manager, Mike Mikus, said their focus groups at the time showed Fetterman\u2019s style was both a clear strength and a nagging question. Mikus said multiple women would comment in these groups about how a woman candidate \u201ccould never get away with dressing like that.\u201d \u201cThat happens with candidates like him. There are people who are just a little more traditional. Even if they want to buck the system, they still want someone who looks that part,\u201d he said. \u201cWith some voters, he will have some work to do and he will need to convince them just because of the way he dresses and the way he looks and the tattoos that he is serious.\u201d Much like the socialist charge, accusations that Fetterman will struggle to win the support of Black voters in Pennsylvania are certain to nag him in a general election. Kenyatta, a 31-year-old Black gay state representative, has made this one of his most potent critiques against Fetterman, using a string of debate performances to specifically question a 2013 incident in which Fetterman left his home, shotgun in tow, to confront what turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger, after hearing the sound of gunshots in the area and calling 911. \u201cFor somebody who has cut an image as an incredibly tough guy, you\u2019re so afraid of two little words: I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Kenyatta said in April. \u201cThe problem is that John still, nine years later, refuses to do one of the most important things that you want from any leader.\u201d In an interview with CNN, Kenyatta stood by his statements. \u201cI think it\u2019s a problem. I thought it was a problem on the debate stage. I\u2019ll think it\u2019s a problem on Wednesday,\u201d Kenyatta said, arguing that \u201cmidterm elections are turnout elections\u201d and Black voters have shown they are not motivated to vote \u201cin this next election.\u201d \u201cWe need somebody who can really talk to these people,\u201d Kenyatta said. \u201cAnd I can talk to these people because like I\u2019m one of those people.\u201d Fetterman has defended himself by noting that he was reelected following the incident and, during the debate, said while it was \u201cnot a situation that anyone would want to be involved in,\u201d he was the \u201conly Democrat on stage who has successfully confronted crime and gun violence.\u201d And Joe Certaine, a Fetterman supporter and voting rights activist in Philadelphia, said whether the incident impacts Fetterman\u2019s ability to reach black voters \u201cdepends on how Jon handles it on the stump.\u201d Certaine said he has handled it well so far, but that he imagines Republicans are certain to make it part of their attacks against him. \u201cRepublicans have a way to twisting everything,\u201d he said, arguing that Fetterman is \u201cnot just a guy who came out of the woodwork to run for office\u201d and that his \u201cexperience in Braddock\u201d leads him to \u201ctrust John to handle things well\u201d if he is the commonwealth\u2019s next senator. To Kenyatta supporters, Fetterman\u2019s answers are not good enough \u2013 and their concerns will persist beyond the primary. \u201cWhether he would inspire the minority community to come out and vote for him could be detrimental to the Democratic Party,\u201d said Lillian L. DeBaptiste, the mayor of West Chester and a Kenyatta supporter. \u201c(Fetterman) is not inspirational to marginalized people, and that\u2019s Black, that\u2019s brown, that\u2019s immigrant communities. That\u2019s anybody that doesn\u2019t look like him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "To assume lies would sink House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is to misunderstand the nature of today\u2019s Republican Party: They actually demonstrate his credentials to lead it. That\u2019s not merely because Donald Trump remains the dominant GOP figure. The former President lies incessantly, and his aberrant behavior compels fellow Republicans to lie about him. The problem runs deeper than one man. For a minority party joining blue-collar voters driven by cultural resentment with affluent donors fixed on the bottom line, gaining and wielding power requires dissembling beyond the conventional equivocation that politicians in all parties have always used to amass popular support. One of the GOP\u2019s most successful political consultants of recent decades issued that judgment in a confessional 2020 memoir. Stuart Stevens titled his book: \u201cIt Was All a Lie.\u201d One clear policy example is tax cuts. Like other GOP candidates in 2016, Trump promised that his tax plan would benefit the middle class, not the rich. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost me a fortune,\u201d the billionaire candidate said. That no-tax-cut-for-the-rich pledge was crafted so as not to alienate his working-class supporters. But it was false. As originally proposed and ultimately passed by Republican lawmakers, Trump\u2019s plan provided the largest tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. Lately, Republicans have handled this problem by keeping their objectives quiet. They adopted no platform at their 2020 national convention. To avoid a forum where the party\u2019s nominee would be pressed to speak honestly, the Republican National Committee recently abandoned cooperation with the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, the wealthy former health care executive heading the party campaign to recapture the Senate, recently suggested new taxes on Americans with modest incomes. Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell disavowed the idea; asked about the party\u2019s agenda if it regains control of the chamber, the Kentucky Republican said recently, \u201cI\u2019ll let you know when we take it back.\u201d Relying on extremists whose views and behavior repel mainstream voters requires more deception. So Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona denies knowing the views of White nationalists he associates with; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia testifies that she can\u2019t remember making statements \u2013 such as accusing Speaker Nancy Pelosi of \u201ctreason\u201d \u2013 that video cameras recorded her making. Because he needs their backing, House GOP leader McCarthy shrinks from disciplining Greene and Gosar over their suggestions of violence against Democratic colleagues. He falsely indicated that Democrats had similarly suggested violence. A Public Religion Research Institute poll earlier this year showed about one-fourth of Republicans are drawn to the bizarre fantasies of QAnon, a movement that contends Satan-worshipping pedophiles control the government and the media. Competing for their allegiance pushes Republican politicians past the point of credibility. During Supreme Court confirmation hearings for Biden\u2019s Supreme Court pick, Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, Republican senators including Texas\u2019 Ted Cruz concocted the charge that Jackson had handled child pornography cases with inordinate leniency. The conservative National Review dismissed the attack as \u201cmeritless to the point of demagoguery\u201d; Cruz earned a rebuke from an eminent conservative federal judge for whom he once had clerked. In the 2016 Republican presidential nomination fight, Cruz became the target of preposterous claims. After Trump suggested Cruz\u2019s father was linked to the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the senator from Texas stopped feigning affection. \u201cI\u2019m going to do something I haven\u2019t done for the entire campaign,\u201d Cruz declared. \u201cI\u2019m going to tell you what I really think about Donald Trump. \u2026 This man is a pathological liar.\u201d As President, Trump lived up to Cruz\u2019s label. On his first full day in office, he sent press secretary Sean Spicer to make false claims about the size of his inaugural crowd. Trump lied about policy matters (claiming he had talked North Korea into denuclearization) and personal ones (insisting he knew nothing about payments to Stormy Daniels). After federal prosecutors charged his political adviser Steve Bannon with fraudulently using a We Build the Wall fundraising effort to bilk supporters, Trump pardoned him. Trump\u2019s last White House chief of staff was Mark Meadows, a former member of the right-wing fringe in the House; Brendan Buck, a former top aide to two GOP speakers, called Meadows \u201ca world-class liar.\u201d The GOP\u2019s existential challenge is holding power as demographic change erodes the clout of its overwhelmingly White voter base. Republicans lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections. With the 2020 big lie, Republicans use false claims of fraud to pretend Trump didn\u2019t lose at all. After elections officials and courts rejected them, extremists staged the deadly January 6 insurrection. From the start, Republicans dissembled to cope with the fallout by pointing toward radical leftists rather than Trump supporters. Fox anchor Laura Ingraham did so even while privately exhorting the White House to call off the insurrectionists. Former Trump Cabinet Secretary Rick Perry has denied sending a text message about election fraud that contained his digital signature. In fact, House Republicans have made telling the truth about the election a disqualification. They fired Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming as conference chair and ostracized Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the two Republican members participating in a House committee investigation of January 6. That makes McCarthy\u2019s lie about his private post-insurrection remarks, in which he told colleagues he planned to ask Trump to resign, unremarkable. Busted by audiotape after denying he\u2019d said it, McCarthy lied about the lie. He insisted he\u2019d been denying something else that he hadn\u2019t been accused of. McCarthy has long since reiterated public fealty to Trump. Fellow Republicans reacted as casually to the contretemps as the former President did. Trump told the Wall Street Journal: \u201cI think it\u2019s all a big compliment, frankly.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ohio has changed since Tim Ryan first ran for Congress in 2002 \u2013 and so have the prospects of a Democrat running in the state. \u201cThe perception of the party,\u201d Ryan said bluntly in an interview, \u201cis much different now than it was when I started.\u201d Ryan is the presumptive Democratic Senate nominee in Ohio, all but certain to win his party\u2019s primary on Tuesday against Morgan Harper, an attorney and former senior adviser at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While the Republican race is far murkier \u2013 author J.D. Vance is seen as the front-runner after securing former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement, but a range of candidates are vying for an upset \u2013 Ryan is preparing to accomplish a markedly more difficult task in November: Running as a Democrat in a red-trending state in a likely difficult election cycle for the party. Vance tests Trump's influence in Ohio primary For years, Ohio Democrats have looked to assure national party officials that the state is not a lost cause, but elections after elections have complicated that pitch. No Democrat other than Sen. Sherrod Brown has won nonjudicial statewide office in Ohio since 2008, and President Barack Obama, in 2012, was the last Democratic presidential nominee to win Ohio. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden became the first candidate in the last 60 years to win the White House without winning the state. The trends have left many Democrats wondering if it is even worth vying for statewide office in the Buckeye State anymore, effectively writing off a state once seen as a key political bellwether. The blame, said Ryan, lies with the same national Democrats now casting Ohio as a lost cause. \u201cWe have not done a good job as a party of letting people know that we\u2019re fighting for them and haven\u2019t done the policies over the years that we necessarily needed to be done. And so, a lot of Democrats in key counties, drifted away,\u201d said Ryan, who is making his first statewide run. Ryan\u2019s political story, in many ways, is the story of Ohio. The Democrat was first elected to Congress in 2002, representing a Northeast Ohio district that included his hometown of Niles, along with union-heavy Democratic bastions Youngstown and Warren. While Ryan initially dominated in his races \u2013 including in his home county of Trumbull \u2013 his margins began to fall as Republican strength in Ohio grew. In 2020, Ryan won with just 53% of the vote, his lowest showing in his district since his first election in 2002 (when his Democratic predecessor, James Traficant, ran as an independent and siphoned off 15% of the vote). The shift was most stark in Trumbull County. Throughout much of Ryan\u2019s term, Democratic presidential candidates won around 60% of the vote there \u2013 until Trump ran for president. In 2016, Trump surprised Ohio\u2019s political world by winning Trumbull County by 6 points. He followed that up four years later by carrying the county by 10 points. To Dan Polivka, chairman of the Trumbull County Democratic Party, Trump was a sign of how a slow political shift could speed up in just a few cycles. \u201cThe national issues got trickled down on some of the local elections,\u201d Polivka said of 2016 and 2020. \u201cI still think there is a Democratic base here and a lot of support for a good Democrat. But the national issues now trickle down locally and that never happened before.\u201d Ryan has been eyeing a jump from the House for years. After winning another term in 2018, he explored a presidential run, eventually making it official in 2019. The bid was short-lived \u2013 Ryan only qualified for two Democratic primary debates due to low polling and his run ended less than a year after it began. To Ohio Democrats, there is plenty of blame to go around to explain the state\u2019s shift. Former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, one of two Democrats running for governor this year, said she recently sought to reassure operatives at the Democratic Governors Association that Ohio was still winnable for the right Democratic candidate. Why Democrats are desperate to prove Ohio isn't a lost cause \u201cI think my husband says it best: Democrats like to run resumes, not run people that are really connected to humans,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cThat is what we have done for a long time. We have run really smart guys and not people who are connected to the working class.\u201d Whaley lauded Ryan\u2019s appeal to working-class voters, arguing that she had the same appeal to voters in the Eastern reaches of the state. \u201cWe\u2019re both from communities that are forgotten and ignored, both by state government and federally,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cWe are both from places that are forgotten and ignored. We both have a working-class chip on our shoulder.\u201d As Ryan looks at his chances in November, the issues are both personal and atmospheric. For years, he has been one of the highest-profile Democratic elected officials in Ohio. But Ryan is largely unknown outside his corner of Ohio, something he has attempted to address by completing an 88-county tour over his first year as a Senate candidate. And Ryan is making his first statewide run at a time when unified Democratic control of Washington has soured voters, in Ohio and nationwide, on the party. Ryan is confident he has the kind of profile Ohioans are looking for. When asked about running as a Democrat in this moment, he touted his past actions, such as running against Nancy Pelosi for House Democratic leader in 2016, quarreling with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during Ryan\u2019s ill-fated presidential bid and opposing then-President Obama over trade policy in 2015. He then noted that while he took on Trump, he also stood by him on trade, the creation of the Space Force and combating China. \u201cI\u2019ve got my own record,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this a while, and so I\u2019m not as tied to the Biden agenda only because I\u2019ve got a 20-year record of doing things. \u2026 I\u2019ve got a really good story to share with the Ohio voters that\u2019s not tied to Biden. And so, I\u2019ve got some room.\u201d Ryan put this message in a recent television ad, in which he blamed \u201cboth parties\u201d for \u201cwasting time on stupid fights.\u201d That, for Ryan, is where the Republican Senate primary comes in. That contest has been fierce. Before Trump endorsed Vance, most of the candidates were openly gunning for the former President\u2019s backing, trading attacks over who best represented the MAGA agenda. Once Trump lent his support to Vance, the contest became a microcosm of the fight for the Republican Party, with several outside groups drawing Trump\u2019s ire for backing former Ohio state treasurer Josh Mandel and a candidate in the form of state Sen. Matt Dolan accusing his opponents of debasing themselves to seek the former President\u2019s backing. 'It's created a bit of chaos': How Trump's involvement is shaking up the Ohio Senate race \u201cYou know, the Columbus TV station doesn\u2019t just go to Republicans,\u201d Ryan said, joking that a range of voters, from moderate Republicans to Democrats, have been activated by what he called a \u201cdivisive\u201d GOP primary that focused on \u201cvery narrow issues.\u201d No matter who emerges from the Republican primary, Ryan plans to run on the economic populist issues he believes can still win over voters who backed Trump just two years ago. That path looks like this: Focus on economics, avoid culture wars that Republicans want to highlight and be prepared to stand up to your own party. Central to that plan is also standing up to China, something that has drawn the ire of Asian American groups, who recently accused Ryan of using a 30-second ad to push \u201csinophobic rhetoric\u201d that pits \u201cnativists against those within the #AAPI community.\u201d \u201cIt is us versus China, and instead of taking them on, Washington is wasting our time on stupid fights,\u201d Ryan says in the ad. Ryan has not backed away from the controversy and told CNN that the response worries him that Democrats aren\u2019t prepared to do what is needed to win in a state like Ohio. \u201cThis is the competition,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t have a national conversation about the red China communist government trying to displace us, looking the other way when Russia invades Ukraine and trying to outfox us at every turn \u2026 then we\u2019re all going to be speaking Mandarin in 10 or 15 years.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In the hours after Donald Trump announced his backing of J.D. Vance in the heated Ohio Senate Republican primary, he began asking allies which contest he should disrupt next. Vance, once a fervent critic of Trump during the 2016 presidential race, had cemented his status as the poster boy of MAGA conversions when he earned Trump\u2019s coveted endorsement on Good Friday, and the former President was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with his decision to back the conservative author after many months of closely watching the Ohio race, according to a person close to Trump. \u201cBecause he pulled the trigger in (Ohio), I think you\u2019re going to see him do the same in other messy primaries that were once off the table,\u201d this person said. Trump groups amass $124 million ahead of midterm elections How soon Trump delivers his next big endorsement could shed light on his mindset as May approaches and offers the first real test of his political clout with a series of high-profile primaries. As he looks to use the midterm map to validate his status as the de facto leader of the Republican Party ahead of 2024, every move he makes and candidate he supports puts that goal at risk, particularly his endorsements in highly competitive contests. Nevertheless, by Monday evening, Trump had apparently settled on the contentious Senate GOP primary in Arizona as his next target. \u201cI will be making an Endorsement in the not too distant future!\u201d he wrote at the end of a statement criticizing state Attorney General Mark Brnovich for his failure to prosecute so-called \u201celection crimes,\u201d dashing any hope for Trump\u2019s support that the Senate candidate might have had. The odds of Trump entering next year with a clean record of winners also diminishes with every high-risk move he makes, hence the advice he\u2019s received from some in his circle to hit the pause button on an endorsement in Arizona. One Trump aide, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations, said the former President is currently feeling bullish and has talked about throwing his weight behind a candidate in the Grand Canyon State before the end of this month, long before the August 2 primary. But others in Trump\u2019s orbit have recently counseled him to wait to see how the next month plays out, arguing that the odds of Trump entering next year with a clean record of winners diminishes with every high-risk move he makes. These advisers openly admit that Trump is gearing up for a third presidential bid in 2024 and have told him that the best way to improve his positioning out of the gate is to enter this fall with a clear track record of picking winners. \u201c\u201dYou don\u2019t want to ride the golden escalator again, you want to be surrounded by all the new Republicans that you elected,\u2019\u201d one adviser claimed he told Trump. Mitch McConnell calls Donald Trump's bluff in Alaska But the odds of Trump finishing the 2022 midterm cycle with an unblemished track record of endorsements looks increasingly unlikely as some of his candidates have stumbled on the campaign trail, others have failed to outraise their incumbent opponents and a few remain in competitive primaries. The odds of Trump entering next year with a clean record of winners also diminishes with every high-risk move he makes, hence the advice he\u2019s received from some in his circle to hit the pause button on an endorsement in Arizona. Three Senate candidates whom Trump has endorsed \u2013 Vance in Ohio, Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Rep. Ted Budd in North Carolina \u2013 remain locked in tight primaries and are fighting for survival in their final weeks. The same can be said of former Georgia Sen. David Perdue in his gubernatorial bid, which could deliver a stinging loss for Trump on May 24 if incumbent GOP Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s lead in recent polling lead translates at the ballot box. In an effort to prevent that scenario, Trump recently funneled $500,000 from his Save America PAC to Get Georgia Right PAC, a group that is working to defeat Kemp in the primary, according to a person familiar with the donation. Still, other Trump-backed candidates on the ballot next month who are more likely to deliver good news to the former President include former NFL star-turned-Georgia senate candidate Herschel Walker and Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is heavily favored to win his runoff contest against Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush. \u201cWhether or how he will play in the rest of the calendar year will depend a lot on what happens in places like Pennsylvania and Ohio,\u201d said longtime GOP strategist Rob Stutzman. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to have a clean narrative that he single handedly drove the congressional Republican majorities that will get elected in 2022 but he could have some success if his endorsement can propel come-from-behind candidates.\u201d Trump\u2019s rush to prove his sway over the GOP has left him in a vulnerable spot if the gubernatorial and down-ballot races he is counting on to drive momentum next month fail to deliver his desired results. While one or two losses could be chalked up to fundraising difficulties or personality issues, one former Trump campaign official said the former President will be forced to recalibrate the midterm strategy he\u2019s developed from his Palm Beach perch if voters reject multiple candidates who are competing with his stamp of approval. Alternatively, this person said, the major risks that Trump has taken \u2013 both in recruiting insurgent candidates to challenge Republican incumbents and diving into crowded primaries \u2013 could deliver major rewards if the bulk of those contestants prevail. Why you can't rely on Trump to help win a GOP primary in 2022 The earliest barometer of Trump\u2019s influence will happen May 3 in Ohio, when voters in the Republican primary will decide whether to send Vance to the general election contest, where he is likely to face Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan. Should one of the other Trump-aligned candidates vanquish Vance, aides expect Trump to become more reserved in choosing which remaining primaries to wade into. He has not yet endorsed in gubernatorial primaries happening between June and August in Nevada, Wisconsin or Michigan, nor has he endorsed a Senate candidate in Arizona, Missouri or Alabama, where he yanked his support from Rep. Mo Brooks in March while promising to re-endorse before the May 24 primary. \u201cYou could see him retreat a bit if things don\u2019t go well next month,\u201d said one Trump adviser, who requested anonymity to speak candidly. \u201cFor instance, I wouldn\u2019t expect him to go endorsing (Blake) Masters if Vance loses in Ohio,\u201d the adviser added, referencing the Arizona Senate candidate who, like Vance, has been bankrolled by conservative tech billionaire and Trump confidant Peter Thiel in his primary. The person close to Trump described the next 30 days as \u201cpivotal\u201d to the former President\u2019s future inside the GOP, especially if he decides to run again in 2024. Some Trump aides have privately joked that a successful run in May will finally give him something to talk about besides the 2020 election, this person said. Publicly, Trump has appeared confident about his candidate choices so far. In his endorsement of Vance, he repeatedly cast the \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author as the only Republican capable of taking down Ryan in the general election. \u201cI\u2019ve studied this race closely and I think J.D. is the most likely to take out the weak, but dangerous, Democrat opponent \u2013 dangerous because they will have so much money to spend,\u201d Trump said in a statement last Friday. But behind the scenes and occasionally in public, he has already begun lowering expectations. Who could beat Donald Trump in 2024? The former President, who was persuaded to endorse Vance by a slew of longtime allies \u2013 including Fox News host Tucker Carlson, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk \u2013 has acknowledged to some in his circle that he is worried about Ryan, not because of the massive war chest he is likely to have at his disposal but because the Ohio congressman has made a point of reaching rural and white working-class voters whom Democrats have overlooked in past cycles. One recent campaign ad from Ryan also blamed America\u2019s current economic woes on China, echoing Trump\u2019s posture toward Beijing. Nowhere, though, has Trump engaged more blatantly in expectation-setting than in the race for governor in Georgia. Less than a month before his PAC contributed half a million dollars to help defeat Kemp, who drew Trump\u2019s ire in the wake of the 2020 election for refusing to indulge his voter fraud conspiracies, the former President told a right-wing news outlet that he endorses \u201ca lot of people that are long shots\u201d in response to a question about Perdue. Instead of stopping there, he went so far as to suggest that he could lose the Georgia gubernatorial primary \u2013 marking a rare acknowledgement of weakness by Trump. \u201cHopefully David Perdue is going to win. These are not sure things. If I lose one along the way, which you have to, right, they\u2019re going to say, \u2018This is a humiliating experience.\u2019 I could be 100 wins and one loss, and they\u2019d make it sound like this is humiliating,\u201d Trump said in the March 29 interview with Real America\u2019s Voice. Here's how much more cash Senate Democrats have than their Republican opponents Should the May primaries tarnish his endorsement record, some Republicans expect Trump to waste no time blaming everyone but himself for the unfavorable outcome. After all, when the former President announced his plan last month to withdraw his endorsement from Brooks in Alabama, he claimed the congressman had made himself unwinnable by refusing to spend the bulk of his campaign talking about the 2020 election. \u201cMo, you just blew the election,\u201d Trump said he thought to himself after Brooks told a crowd in Culman, Alabama, last August to move on from 2020. That\u2019s the kind of reaction Perdue can expect if he loses his May 24 primary to Kemp, said Stutzman. \u201cHis (modus operandi) is to turn on all of these people. Look at Mo Brooks. He\u2019ll blame others and none of it will be his fault,\u201d Stutzman said.",

            "article_content": "Give J.D. Vance this: He gets the whole Donald Trump thing. In fact, back in 2016, before he was running for US Senate as a Trump acolyte, the Ohio Republican offered a pitch-perfect analysis of why the billionaire businessman had caught on with Republican voters. \u201cI think most people are not very ideological, and Trump, while I find him loathsome, touches a legitimate nerve,\u201d Vance wrote in a private Facebook message to Josh McLaurin, a friend from Yale Law School. McLaurin, now a Democratic state representative in Georgia, posted the message from 2016 on his Twitter feed and shared more of his past interaction with Vance with Vice News. (Vance\u2019s campaign dismissed the message as \u201cold news.\u201d) \u201cBut I\u2019m not surprised by Trump\u2019s rise, and I think the entire party has only itself to blame,\u201d Vance wrote in the message. \u201cWe are, whether we like it or not, the party of lower-income, lower-education white people, and I have been saying for a long time that we need to offer those people SOMETHING (and hell, maybe even expand our appeal to working-class black people in the process) or a demagogue would. We are now at that point. Trump is the fruit of the party\u2019s collective neglect.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Yes! That is (almost) exactly right! Let\u2019s take Vance\u2019s point about what the Republican coalition looks like right now. Here are a few takeaways from the 2016 presidential election exit poll: * Trump won White voters over Hillary Clinton by 20 points. * Trump won 66% among White voters with no college degree. * Trump won only two income groups: Those whose income was between $50,000 and $99,999 and those who income was between $100,000 and $199,000. He also tied with Clinton among those whose income was $250,000 or more. And here\u2019s how that compares to his performance in the 2020 election: * Trump won White voters over Joe Biden by 17 points. * Trump won 67% among White voters with no college degree. * Trump won one income bracket: Those making between $100,000 and $199,000. He also tied with Biden among those making at least $200,000. So, Vance is exactly right about Republicans being dominant among White voters without a college degree. It\u2019s harder to make a clear determination on his contention that Republicans are also the party of lower-income White voters because the exit poll doesn\u2019t break out income by race. But the available data suggests that Trump voters skewed slightly wealthier than Vance\u2019s contention. Now for the second \u2013 and more critical \u2013 part of Vance\u2019s diagnosis of Trump\u2019s appeal: That the billionaire businessman gave Republican voters something to believe in. At the core of Trump\u2019s appeal \u2013 then and now \u2013 was an aspirational argument that he not-so-subtly made to voters. What he was (and is) selling was the notion that he had succeeded in life and that by electing him, you too could be rich and famous. \u201cTrump capitalized on the power of the Trump brand, which people associate with and aspire to luxury, wealth and celebrity,\u201d Northwestern marketing professor Tim Calkins told The Washington Post in November 2016. During his term in office, Trump, again and again, sought to paint he and his supporters as the richest, smartest and the best. Here\u2019s one riff from the campaign trail in 2018: \u201cI meet these people they call them \u2018the elite.\u2019 These people. I look at them, I say, \u2018That\u2019s elite?\u2019 We got more money, we got more brains, we got better houses, apartments, we got nicer boats, we\u2019re smarter than they are, and they say they\u2019re elite? We\u2019re the elite. You\u2019re the elite. We\u2019re the elite.\u201d \u201cSo I said the other day, let\u2019s keep calling these people\u2014and let\u2019s face it, they\u2019ve been stone-cold losers, the elite, the elite\u2014so let them keep calling themselves the elite,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut we\u2019re going to call ourselves\u2014and remember you are indeed, you work harder, but you are indeed smarter than them\u2014let\u2019s call ourselves from now on the super-elite. We\u2019re the super-elite.\u201d Trump, as Vance rightly notes, filled a void for lots and lots of voters. He gave them something to believe in \u2013 and, maybe even more importantly, someone to be against (\u201cthe elites\u201d). Vance\u2019s past comments make his transformation into a Trump-endorsed candidate for Senate all the more remarkable \u2013 and transparent. Vance understands the roots of Trump and Trumpism. And the hucksterism that sits at the heart of it.",

            "article_content": "Matt Mowers, the former Trump administration aide who is running for Congress in New Hampshire, voted twice during the 2016 primary, according to voting records obtained by CNN, opening the Republican candidate up to criticism from his opponents and charges of hypocrisy from Democrats. Mowers, then a top aide in New Hampshire to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s presidential campaign, cast a ballot in the Granite State\u2019s critical February primary, according to the city of Manchester\u2019s official voter checklist for the contest. Christie\u2019s presidential campaign was short lived, though, and after the New Jersey chief executive finished sixth in New Hampshire\u2019s Republican primary, he dropped out of the race and eventually endorsed then-candidate Donald Trump. Mowers, however, cast another ballot in a presidential primary four months later, according to documents obtained by CNN, using his parents\u2019 New Jersey address to re-register in his longtime home state and cast a ballot in the state\u2019s June Republican primary. The fact that Mowers voted twice in the 2016 primary, which was first reported by the Associated Press, opens the Republican candidate up to legal questions and accusations of hypocrisy as the Republican has made election integrity a central issue in his campaign. Mowers responded to the Associated Press reporting by attacking Democrats and saying he was \u201cproud to work for President Trump as the GOP establishment was working to undermine his nomination and accepted a job with his campaign in 2016, registered to vote and casted my vote in accordance with the law, and served as an elected Trump delegate to the Republican National Convention.\u201d At no point in the statement does Mowers deny that he voted twice in the 2016 primary process. One of the most frequent attacks against Mowers in the New Hampshire Republican primary has been his ties to the state he hopes to represent, something that will be fueled by his decision to re-register in New Jersey in 2016. Mowers also cast his ballot in the 2016 general election in New Jersey, according to voting records. \u201cWhile I\u2019m running the bill in NH for a full forensic audit of the 2020 Presidential election, @mowers is potentially breaking federal law by voting in BOTH NH and NJ,\u201d Tim Baxter, a Republican state representative who is also running in the Republican primary, tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cMy question for \u2018#JerseyMowers\u2019: Are you running to represent #NH01 or NJ?\u201d The story could be particularly potent in New Hampshire, a state where Republicans have looked to crack down on who can vote in their elections, especially targeting transient populations and short-term residents like students. It is unlikely that Mowers will face any prosecution for voting in two states in 2016. While New Hampshire law says \u201ca person is guilty of a class B felony if\u201d they \u201cknowingly\u201d cast a ballot in New Hampshire and \u201calso casts a ballot in the same election year in any election held in any other state or territory of the United States,\u201d the law says one defense could be if the \u201cperson legitimately moved.\u201d Michael S. Garrity, spokesperson for the New Hampshire Department of Justice, told CNN on Tuesday that the state\u2019s \u201cElection Law team is aware of the Associated Press report and is reviewing the matter.\u201d Charlie Spies, a Republican lawyer who has known Mowers for years, said the law around the issue of voting in two primaries is a \u201cgray area\u201d and called the chance the candidate could face legal trouble because of it \u201cnon-existent.\u201d \u201cMr. Mowers moved to New Jersey, established residency there and then had a pattern in voting in New Jersey. It is an open question whether the election referred to in the statute would be a party controlled primary election in one state, versus another state months earlier,\u201d Spies said. \u201cEven if it were a clear violation of a clear statute within the statute of limitations, which it is not, but even if it were, there is no evidence, that I am aware of, of anybody having been prosecuted.\u201d The political ramifications for Mowers, however, could be more dramatic than the legal. Mowers\u2019 Republican opponents have already seized on the story, wasting no time to note how the candidate voting twice in the same primary cycle is out of step with the Republican focus on securing elections, an emphasis that has been spurred by Trump\u2019s baseless claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. \u201cMy opponent\u2026 potentially violated election law, and he is hiding behind his attorney, calling the report \u2018silly,\u201d Karoline Leavitt, another former Trump aide running in the New Hampshire primary, wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is a very, very serious allegation. Election integrity matters. Voters deserve truth and @mowers owes them an honest answer.\u201d Gail Huff Brown, another candidate in the Republican primary, tweeted, \u201cThe Republican Party is the party of election integrity, and we cannot nominate someone who has engaged in voter fraud and expect to be taken seriously on the topic. We can do better.\u201d Mowers, like many Republicans running in 2022, cites election integrity as a central issue to his campaign, writing on his website that \u201cnothing is more important or sacred than each American\u2019s right to vote\u201d and backing \u201cestablishing effective voter ID laws, regular audits of elections to verify vote totals and provide every American citizen with the certainty that their vote counts.\u201d Mowers also specifically notes that he supports Republican efforts in New Hampshire to \u201cimprove our own voting laws so that only legal residents of New Hampshire are entitled to vote, and voter ID is required.\u201d Republicans have made New Hampshire\u2019s First Congressional race a top target in 2022, hoping a pro-Republican national environment will help unseat Democrat Rep. Chris Pappas, who defeated Mowers by 5% in 2020. Mowers is married to a senior video producer at CNN.",

            "article_content": "Desperate to prove Ohio isn\u2019t a lost cause, Democratic candidates for governor and an open Senate seat are attempting to steer clear of culture wars and tap into a vein of economic populism that has eluded them in the increasingly red state in recent decades. It hasn\u2019t been long since Democrats last won in Ohio. Former President Barack Obama won the state in both 2008 and 2012. And in 2018, Sen. Sherrod Brown won his third term. However, those high-profile victories obscured a much bleaker reality in the state for the Democratic Party. No other Democrat has won statewide office here since 2006. In 2020, Joe Biden became the first person to win the presidency without winning Ohio since 1960 \u2013 effectively ending Ohio\u2019s bellwether status, though it had been clear for several election cycles that Ohio was no longer the tipping-point state that would push a presidential candidate over 270 electoral votes. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s 8-point victories in Ohio in 2016 and 2020 underscored just how far Democrats had slid, particularly in the state\u2019s White, rural areas. This year, the open-seat Senate race created by Republican Sen. Rob Portman\u2019s retirement, along with the gubernatorial race, will offer the latest test of whether Democrats can still win in the Buckeye State \u2013 or whether Ohio\u2019s battleground status will continue to fade. Rep. Tim Ryan is the leading candidate to take on whoever emerges from a packed, acrimonious seven-person Republican Senate primary. Meanwhile, two former mayors are competing for the Democratic nomination for a governor\u2019s race that would likely pit the primary winner against incumbent Gov. Mike DeWine. Those candidates have largely honed in on a similar approach: Focus almost exclusively on jobs and wages. Defend workers and union rights, and hammer away at China and free trade deals. Stay out of the culture wars that are animating the Republican base. It\u2019s an economic message that carries unmistakable echoes of both Trump and Brown. \u201cThe Sherrod Brown model is the model to win in Ohio,\u201d said Aaron Pickrell, a veteran Ohio Democratic strategist and a leader of Obama\u2019s winning 2008 and 2012 efforts in the state. \u201cI will not compare Sherrod Brown to Donald Trump. But tapping into economic anxiety to convey how you\u2019re going to help Ohioans address their economic anxiety is the way to win.\u201d But, strategists say, the appeal of Trump and Brown in Ohio isn\u2019t just their message. In their own ways, both strike voters as authentic figures. Brown has survived while other Midwestern Democrats have lost in part because, over decades in public life, he has cultivated a working-class-focused brand that\u2019s helped by his raspy voice and rumpled appearance. In 2018, he dramatically outperformed the rest of the Democratic statewide ticket: Brown won reelection by 7 percentage points, while DeWine won the governor\u2019s office and down-ballot Republicans won statewide offices by about 4 percentage points. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of reasons that Sherrod wins, and one of them is similar to the reason Donald Trump won Ohio: In states like this where it\u2019s a competitive state that has begun to tilt one direction, voters value authenticity more than anything,\u201d said Justin Barasky, a Democratic strategist who managed Brown\u2019s 2018 campaign and is advising Ryan\u2019s Senate bid. \u201cThey know every time they hear from Sherrod Brown that they\u2019re getting an authentic person,\u201d Barasky said. \u201cThey know why he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing, who he\u2019s fighting for, that he\u2019s in it for the right reasons. For better or worse, they believe it about Trump, too.\u201d That brand is difficult to build in one election cycle. But Ryan, the 10-term congressman from Youngstown who in 2016 challenged Nancy Pelosi for the House speakership and launched a short-lived 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, is trying. Ryan, 48, was first elected to Congress in 2002. He\u2019s a frequent visitor in Ohio\u2019s union halls, and has made stories about his family\u2019s working-class roots a staple on the campaign trail. He pitches himself as a Democrat in Brown\u2019s mold, and tells crowds that while he disagreed with Trump on a number of issues, he supported the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has centered his campaign on an argument for policies that would force corporations to \u201cstart cutting workers in on the deal.\u201d \u201cOhio has to lead the way in bringing our supply chain back, taking on China, building the things that will build our future,\u201d he said in his opening remarks at a Monday debate at Central State University, a historically Black university in Wilberforce, Ohio, east of Dayton. Ryan is traveling to rural, heavily Republican areas of the state frequently ignored by Democrats, trying to stop the party\u2019s bleeding there after years of Republicans racking up enormous margins of victory in those counties. Ohio\u2019s urban areas favor Democrats, but cities like Cincinnati and Columbus don\u2019t provide the huge margins that the party\u2019s candidates receive in the urban counties in nearby Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Democrats have consistently won statewide contests in recent years. So chipping away at the GOP\u2019s dominance in Ohio\u2019s rural counties is critical, Democratic strategists said, to returning the state to competitive status. \u201cTim\u2019s learning what people care about, people are talking about him being there, he\u2019s talking to the press while he\u2019s there. Every corner of Ohio, people are going to know Tim\u2019s looking out for him,\u201d Pickrell said. Still, Ryan has a primary challenge to overcome in May before he can focus on the winner of a seven-way GOP primary. Morgan Harper, an attorney and former senior adviser to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has challenged Ryan from the left. In the debate Monday, Harper criticized Ryan for previously receiving an \u201cA\u201d rating from the National Rifle Association and for taking campaign money from defense contractors. She said Congress should cancel student loan debt and expand the Supreme Court \u2013 positions Ryan did not embrace. Still, Ryan is the clear favorite, with a massive financial advantage: He ended 2021 with $5 million his campaign\u2019s bank account, more than 10 times what Harper had on hand. That allowed Ryan to launch a $3.3 million ad buy this week \u2013 with his first 30-second spot focused solely on China. \u201cIt is us versus China, and instead of taking them on, Washington is wasting our time on stupid fights,\u201d Ryan says in the ad. DeWine, the Republican governor who has been in office for nearly 40 years \u2013 first as a local prosecutor and then state legislator, then as a member of the US House, then Ohio\u2019s lieutenant governor, then the US Senate, and finally back to Ohio as attorney general before being elected governor in 2018 \u2013 faces GOP competition in his bid for a second term. DeWine emerged early in the coronavirus pandemic as among the leading governors advocating public health measures to slow the pandemic. But in his first television ad of the primary season this week, he pushed the other way, highlighting his efforts to re-open Cleveland schools in early 2021. It\u2019s a response to the pressure he faces from the right: Former US Rep. Jim Renacci and farmer and business owner Joe Blystone are campaigning on criticism of DeWine\u2019s handling of the pandemic, saying the measures he took to close schools and businesses early went too far. In a gubernatorial debate at Central State University the day after the Senate candidates debated, the two Democratic candidates vying to take on DeWine, former Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley and former Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley, focused on jobs, rather than DeWine\u2019s pandemic management. But they also offered a glimpse at a strategy that could help Democrats win the state\u2019s suburban regions, casting DeWine and Republicans as too extreme on social issues \u2013 particularly hammering DeWine\u2019s decision to sign into law a measure passed by the Republican-led legislature that allows concealed carry of firearms without a license. Whaley pointed to DeWine\u2019s pledge to \u201cdo something\u201d after a 2019 mass shooting left nine dead in Dayton. \u201cNever in my worst nightmare did I think the thing he was going to do was to actually make it worse,\u201d she said. Lambasting Republicans in statehouses for overreaching on social issues is part of Democrats\u2019 strategy across the midterm map, with party operatives looking for ways to turn the GOP\u2019s focus on issues that animate a base still devoted to Trump against Republicans in the general election. \u201cAmong independents and suburban swing voters, people want the economy to be good and they don\u2019t want to live in this really conservative state that is focused on social issues that don\u2019t affect their day to day life that much,\u201d Pickrell said. CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this story misstated the campaign Barasky is advising. It is Ryan\u2019s current Senate bid.",

            "article_content": "The House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol is racing against a political clock to get to the bottom of what happened that day, and in the lead-up to the attack. While two Republicans sit on the nine-member panel, it\u2019s a committee created by a Democratic-controlled House that GOP leadership has tried to discredit. One of those Republican panelists, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, is facing a primary challenger backed by former President Donald Trump. The other, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, is not running for reelection. And the January 6 committee itself is likely to be disbanded if Republicans win back the House in November. So how likely are Republicans to win this fall? Historically, very likely. The party in the White House traditionally loses seats in the first midterm election of a new president\u2019s term. In fact, the president\u2019s party has lost an average of 30 House seats in midterm elections over the last 100 years, according to Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Republicans only need a net gain of five seats to win the chamber this year. A reminder: A net gain of five seats is not the same thing as winning five seats. A party needs at least 218 seats to win control of the House. While Republicans are trying to flip seats this year, so are the Democrats \u2013 so any GOP wins will have to be offset by any losses they incur. That said, losses are not a huge concern for Republicans right now. Given the historical trends working in their favor and the fact that President Joe Biden\u2019s approval rating is 40% in the latest CNN average of national polls, the national environment seems to be working in their favor. And the uptick in retirement announcements by several longtime Democratic incumbents in recent months is a telling sign they weren\u2019t looking forward to serving in the minority. But it\u2019s not all bad news for Democrats. The House map is not as favorable to Republicans as the majority party feared it could have been. The once-a-decade redistricting process is nearly complete (except for a handful of states), which has resulted in new congressional lines that Democrats think give them a shot at holding their majority. Overall, the biggest takeaway from redistricting is that the number of competitive House seats has shrunk, which means that in most states, primaries \u2013 rather than general election contests \u2013 will be the main event. Several states are hosting member-on-member primaries, in which two incumbents are running in the same district, either because their state lost a seat in redistricting or they were drawn into the same seat for partisan reasons. While those races can provide plenty of intraparty drama \u2013 and in some cases, a test of Trump\u2019s enduring influence over the GOP \u2013 they\u2019re mostly not expected to have any effect on the general election. In West Virginia, for example, two Republican incumbents \u2013 one who objected to certifying the 2020 presidential election and one who did not \u2013 are facing off in a heavily Republican district. Regardless of who wins the May primary, the seat is highly unlikely to fall into Democratic hands in November. Some states hold open primaries \u2013 in which candidates from all parties run on the same primary ballot with the top two or four candidates advancing to the general election. One of those states is Alaska, where former governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin is running in a special election for the state\u2019s at-large seat left vacant by the death  last month of Republican Rep. Don Young. Barring any primary surprises, Republicans are expected to hold this seat. How gerrymandering makes the US House intensely partisan Just 61 House races (out of 435) are currently rated as competitive by Inside Elections. Of those, only 16 are rated as Toss-up races \u2013 seven seats held by Republicans, eight held by Democrats and one new seat in Colorado. A smaller landscape of competitive races means Republicans will be reaching deeper into Democratic territory to look for pickup opportunities. On Wednesday, for example, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm of the House GOP, expanded its list of targets to 72 Democratic-held or newly created seats, including districts that now-President Joe Biden carried by double digits in 2020. Of course, these target lists evolve over time and don\u2019t necessarily reflect where money ends up getting spent. On the same day as the NRCC announcement, House Majority PAC \u2013 the leading Democratic super PAC focused on House races \u2013 publicized TV and digital advertising reservations of more than $100 million across 50 media markets. That\u2019s nearly double the amount the group made in initial reservations in 2020. A top focus for Republicans is sure to be the Democratic-held seats that Trump won in 2020. That includes districts represented by Reps. Jared Golden of Maine, Cindy Axne of Iowa and Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, all of whom are in for tough races this fall. But the majority of the NRCC\u2019s targets are seats that Biden won. That goes to show just how few \u201ccrossover\u201d districts \u2013 those that voted one way for president but backed a US House representative of a different party \u2013 are left for Republicans to try to flip. Increasingly nationalized and partisan elections have done away with the likes of former Minnesota Rep. Collin Peterson, a Democrat whose district voted for Trump by the biggest margin \u2013 30 points \u2013 in 2016. But after narrowly holding on to his sprawling, rural district in 2018, the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee went down in 2020. Republicans were encouraged by their gains with Hispanic voters in 2020 and hope that trend continues this year, especially in places such as Texas\u2019 Rio Grande Valley, where several House seats are in play. Why polls may be underestimating Republicans They\u2019re also hoping they may be able to make a play for some of the traditionally GOP-leaning suburban districts that moved away from them during the Trump era. Democratic retirements have also set up a few enticing pickup opportunities for Republicans. Retiring Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos, the former chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has often touted her success in a Trump-voting district. Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb, who is running for Senate, talks up his record of winning in Trump country. But both are leaving behind seats that will see competitive races, according to Inside Elections. Democrats hoping to maintain their House majority need to defend the seats they have, while also looking to pick up a few more to help offset the inevitable losses they\u2019re likely to incur in a midterm year with their party holding full control of Washington (the White House, Senate and House). House Democrats\u2019 top defensive holds are incumbents the DCCC calls \u201cFrontline\u201d members. Many of these incumbents have had tough races before, and some of their districts became more favorable in redistricting, although perhaps not enough to ensure a comfortable reelection in a difficult national environment. Golden, a two-term incumbent from Maine, for example, has a history of overperforming the top of the ticket. His district\u2019s White working-class voters twice backed Trump, while Golden won reelection in 2020 by 6 points. But even if he\u2019s bucked the national Democratic Party on certain major votes in Washington, he\u2019s still in for a tough race, potentially facing off against a better-funded and more organized opponent than he did two years ago. Former GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin, whom Golden unseated in 2018 under Maine\u2019s ranked-choice voting system, is running again. Inside Elections rates the race a Toss-up. Trump's endorsement power will be put to the test as May primaries approach Many of the DCCC\u2019s Frontliners who won in 2018 \u2013 when Democrats flipped the House during Trump\u2019s presidency \u2013 are used to raising huge sums of money. They set new quarterly records for hauls in the millions that put even some Senate candidates to shame. But not all Democrats who potentially face competitive races this year after redistricting are accustomed to that level of campaigning. Two longtime incumbents, Reps. Sanford Bishop of Georgia and Marcy Kaptur of Ohio, haven\u2019t faced competitive elections in years. Democrats believe they can remain competitive in the suburbs, which soured on Republicans under Trump. Still, Trump is not in office or on the ballot, which will be a test of whether Democrats can sustain base voter enthusiasm without him. Democrats are also eyeing pickup opportunities, especially in GOP-held seats that Biden won. That includes a handful of districts in California and New York, although there\u2019s new uncertainty over the district lines in the Empire State after a judge blocked the Democratic-drawn map on Thursday. And even if Trump isn\u2019t on the ballot this year, he\u2019s proving he still wants to be a force in GOP politics. For Democrats, that\u2019s good news if he helps drive GOP candidates to the right in getting through primaries for competitive seats. In Michigan, for example, he\u2019s backing a primary challenger to freshman Rep. Peter Meijer, who voted to impeach Trump, in a district that could be harder for Republicans to hold without the incumbent.",

            "article_content": "Buried in a court filing late Wednesday from the January 6 committee is an explosive email exchange between Greg Jacob, a top lawyer for then-Vice President Mike Pence, and John Eastman, a lawyer who was working with then-President Donald Trump\u2019s legal team, that absolutely nails the culpability of Eastman in the events of that terrible day. The email exchange began on January 5, with Eastman attempting to push the idea that Pence had the constitutional authority to reject certain electors from swing states when the votes were counted in Congress the next day. On January 6 at 12:14 pm ET, as it was becoming increasingly clear that there was a Trump-inspired riot brewing at the US Capitol, Jacob was unequivocal in his rejection of Eastman\u2019s theories. \u201cI have run down every legal trail placed before me to its conclusion, and I respectfully conclude that as a legal framework, it is a results-oriented position that you would never support if attempted by the opposition, and essentially entirely made up,\u201d Jacob wrote Eastman. \u201cAnd thanks to your bullshit, we are now under siege.\u201d To which Eastman responds: \u201cThe \u2018siege\u2019 is because YOU and your boss did not do what was necessary to allow this to be aired in a public way so the American people can see for themselves what happened.\u201d In his next response, Jacob drops the hammer: \u201cThe advice provided has, whether intended or not, functioned as a serpent in the ear of the President of the United States, the most powerful office in the entire world. And here we are.\u201d Jacob went on: \u201cRespectfully, it was gravely, gravely irresponsible for you to entice the President with an academic theory that had no legal viability, and that you well know we would lose before any judge who heard and decided the case. And if the courts declined to hear it, I suppose it could only be decided in the streets. The knowing amplification of that theory through numerous surrogates, whipping large numbers of people into a frenzy over something with no chance of ever attaining legal force through actual process of law, has led us to where we are.\u201d Yes, that\u2019s it exactly. Eastman\u2019s infamous memo \u2013 in which he outlined how Pence could overturn the Electoral College results \u2013 was, as Jacob rightly noted, the stuff of debate in a law school class, maybe, but certainly not the framework on which an election should be decided. And Jacob nails the role the memo \u2013 and Eastman more generally \u2013 played in the run-up to January 6. He handed a drowning man a rope. Trump, in the days and weeks after the election, was desperate to find something, anything that would allow him to make the case that a) he hadn\u2019t really lost and b) he could stay on as president. It was during that same time period that Trump called Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to urge him to overturn the results. \u201cAll I want to do is this,\u201d Trump told Raffensperger. \u201cI just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\u201d  Trump was engaged in similar pressure campaigns in other swing states as well. What\u2019s so incredibly damning about the Jacob-Eastman email exchange is that the former is utterly convinced that the latter knows that what he is doing is wrong \u2013 and is doing it anyway, with disastrous consequences for the party. The image of Eastman as Iago pouring his poison in the ear of Trump\u2019s Othello is a powerful one. Especially when you consider that Jacob wasn\u2019t some lawyer working for Democrats. He was the chief counsel to the Republican vice president of the United States. That fact makes his accusations against Eastman all the more powerful.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s generally a good rule to judge people by those who work most closely with them. Which makes what former Attorney General Bill Barr thinks of Donald Trump all the more important \u2013 and intriguing. In excerpts of his forthcoming book obtained by the Washington Post, Barr takes a decidedly dim view of the former President after working closely together for much of the final two years of his time in office. Of Trump, Barr writes at one point: \u201cPeople are worthwhile to Trump only as means to his ends \u2014 as utensils. When they don\u2019t help him get what he wants, they are useless.\u201d That is as concise \u2013 and accurate \u2013 of a description I have seen yet of the purely transactional nature of how Trump engages with the everyone he meets. For Trump, you are useful to him if you are willing to do what he wants you to do. The second you stop doing exactly what he wants you to do, you turn into an impediment to him \u2013 and the enemy. (This is not to excuse Barr and his indulgences of Trump; he should have known what he was getting into. It\u2019s not as though Trump hid his true nature from, well, anyone.) Examples of Trump\u2019s transactional approach to politics are littered throughout his presidency. But it\u2019s worth pulling out two specific cases. When then-Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump back in February 2016, Trump couldn\u2019t get enough of him. He liked Sessions so much that he eventually nominated him to be US attorney general, calling him \u201ca world-class legal mind\u201d and adding: \u201cJeff is greatly admired by legal scholars and virtually everyone who knows him.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Then Sessions recused himself from the FBI investigation into Russia\u2019s attempts to influence the 2016 election. Sessions had stopped being useful to Trump. And Trump went to war with his own attorney general. He called him \u201cscared stiff and Missing in Action.\u201d He said he was \u201cbeleaguered.\u201d And according to the New York Times, Trump called Sessions an \u201cidiot\u201d to his face in May 2017 and said he should resign. (There\u2019s more \u2013 lots more.) In November 2018, Trump fired Sessions. Then there\u2019s the case of former Vice President Mike Pence. After the lone vice presidential debate in 2016, Trump took credit for Pence. \u201cMike Pence did an incredible job and I\u2019m getting a lot of credit because this was my so-called first choice, that was my first hire as we would say,\u201d said Trump. Pence reciprocated for most of Trump\u2019s presidency. He was as obsequious as possible \u2013 one-upping every other Trump sycophant at every turn. (Read this for more on that.) Then Trump demanded that Pence overturn the 2020 election on January 6, 2021. This exchange, reported by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book \u201cPeril,\u201d speaks to how the duo\u2019s relationship eroded. Trump said, according to the authors: \u201cNo, no, no! You don\u2019t understand, Mike. You can do this. I don\u2019t want to be your friend anymore if you don\u2019t do this.\u201d There\u2019s myriad other examples during Trump\u2019s tenure of this sort of behavior. It\u2019s the defining trait of the man who spent four years as president and is giving every indication that he will run again in 2024. For Trump, the world is divided into two kinds of people: Those who are willing to do his bidding and those who aren\u2019t. The first are allies; the second are enemies. It\u2019s just that simple.",

            "article_content": "When Donald Trump arrived in Florida one year ago to begrudgingly settle into his post-presidential life, he did not have a plan. Staffers were making regular trips to Staples, trying to create a functional office for themselves and the former commander in chief at his Mar-a-Lago club. Allies were doling out conflicting advice \u2013 telling Trump to lie low until his impeachment trial concluded in the Senate or get out and aggressively defend himself. Aides who had been by his side for years suddenly disappeared as they weighed their next moves. \u201cIt was a chaotic period,\u201d recalled a person close to Trump when asked recently to describe the 45th President\u2019s first few weeks of ostensible retirement. \u201cWhat you see today \u2013 in terms of the political machine he is building \u2013 is a night and day difference from where we were 12 months ago.\u201d A lot has changed in the year since Trump left Washington. Though his presidency ended in disgrace, his endorsement remains one of the most coveted prizes in Republican primaries. His political apparatus, after sending cease-and-desist letters to three of the largest GOP fundraising outfits last March, has now amassed more than $100 million in cash and convinced the Republican National Committee \u2013 one of the letter recipients \u2013 to partially cover some of his personal legal bills. And Trump\u2019s once-dysfunctional operation, which nearly blew up the Ohio US Senate primary with a premature and unvetted endorsement last spring, has become noticeably more organized in its assessment of candidates under the command of GOP campaign veteran Susie Wiles, who has ensured that Trump is briefed on the latest polling and field research before meeting with endorsement-seekers. \u201cSusie has helped give him a real sense of direction and order. The whole Trump family really respects her,\u201d said Trump-aligned pollster Jim McLaughlin. This account of Trump\u2019s first year out of office and his plans for the midterm elections and beyond is based on interviews with more than 20 former and current aides, advisers and close friends of the 45th President, many of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly about Trump or their interactions with him. With few exceptions, they described a former President who feels increasingly emboldened to remain in politics after watching top Republicans bend to his will despite his role in the January 6 insurrection and because of the myriad challenges President Joe Biden has faced during his first term so far. One current Trump adviser said the former President was \u201cstill pretty dejected up until a few months ago, when his whole demeanor started changing the worse things became for Biden.\u201d Only then, the adviser said, did Trump begin \u201cseriously thinking about 2024 and what he needs to do this year so that he\u2019s in a solid position for another campaign.\u201d Because of the changes to his post-presidential operation over the last year, many Republicans now view Trump as a crucial component to their midterm strategy \u2013 an exceedingly popular figure with the party\u2019s base who can help drive turnout in November and launch certain candidates to front-runner status with his endorsement in crowded primaries. However, there is also a contingent of Republican figures who wish Trump would disappear into retirement, concerned that his outsized influence and meddling in primaries threatens both democracy and the GOP\u2019s midterm chances. Trump has virtually no plans to pursue a real retirement anytime soon. His aides say the former President views 2022 as an opportunity to further tighten his grip on the Republican Party by working to usher in a new class of \u201cAmerica First\u201d officials at local, state and national levels. With this mission in mind, he is expected to maintain a steady stream of public appearances in the coming months. Trump is slated to huddle with several of his political aides on January 26 to discuss where, when and how he can dominate the 2022 midterms as a so-called kingmaker inside the GOP. Two people familiar with the meeting said invitees range from Iowa-based operatives Eric Branstad and Alex Latchman, who joined Trump\u2019s Save America leadership PAC last summer, to his spokesman Taylor Budowich and GOP strategist Andy Surabian. \u201cThis is where he will decide where to go and how to spend his money,\u201d said one of the people briefed on the meeting. While some of these decisions have been in the works for a while, Trump\u2019s team is still considering which races are most fertile for him to energize Republican voters without alienating other critical constituencies. In Georgia, for example, several Trump allies said they believe the former President can have a positive impact in the Senate race, which is likely to pit Trump-backed Republican and former NFL star Herschel Walker against incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. But given that Trump narrowly lost the state in 2020, his campaign appearances could also have the opposite effect if his message fails to resonate with voters or depresses voter turnout by focusing too heavily on the past presidential election and his disproven claims of widespread voter fraud in the state, allies warned. \u201cHe has all the right enemies when he focuses on Big Tech, establishment Democrats and Republicans, and the progressive left. It\u2019s when he starts talking about 2020 that he gets himself into trouble with voters that Republicans need,\u201d said a person close to Trump. A year after the insurrection, Republicans around the country still promote Trump's election lies For the most part, the former President has continued to bounce his ideas about messaging and candidates off familiar faces inside his orbit. He speaks regularly to former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, former Ambassador to Germany Ric Grenell, South Carolina\u2019s Sen. Lindsey Graham, former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus and longtime aides like Dan Scavino and Stephen Miller. But he has also welcomed new faces into his inner circle, such as Carlos Trujillo, who served as ambassador to the Organization of American States during his administration and has developed \u201ca strong relationship\u201d with the former President since he relocated to Florida, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trujillo did not respond to a request for comment. People close to Trump say he hopes to schedule at least two rallies every month leading up to August, when most primary outcomes will have been determined, and will then increase his appearances as needed until the November 8 midterms. So far this year, the former President has rallied voters in Arizona, where several Trump-aligned candidates are vying for his endorsement in the Senate primary and gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, a veteran news anchor and MAGA devotee, is hoping to succeed Trump foe Doug Ducey as governor. Trump announced his support of Lake\u2019s campaign last September. Other states that Trump is said to be eyeing for rallies in 2022 include Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, Wisconsin, Missouri, Nevada and possibly New Hampshire, depending on who Republicans recruit to challenge Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan in the Senate race, according to two Trump aides familiar with his midterm strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to Republicans that it\u2019s likely to be a good year and President Trump wants to be one of the leading indicators of why the GOP had a good year at the ballot box. So we will see more engagement from him in the coming months,\u201d said Trump adviser Bryan Lanza. Trump\u2019s rallies have also become hot spots for candidates looking to score face time with the former President in order to nab his endorsement. One former Trump campaign official said two New Jersey candidates had flown to Arizona last weekend with their Trump-aligned consultants \u201cto ask for his endorsement because they couldn\u2019t get a Mar-a-Lago meeting.\u201d In the campaign appearances Trump does make, his political advisers are urging him to spend less time complaining about the past presidential election and more time outlining perceived failures of the Biden administration and Democrats on the pandemic, economic growth, the US military withdrawal from Afghanistan and parental choice in education \u2013 albeit with some attention paid to what Trump and some Republicans refer to as \u201celection integrity.\u201d Of course, that strategy is easier said than done for a notoriously undisciplined messenger like Trump. At his rally in Florence, Arizona, on Saturday, the former President ticked off a number of complaints about the 2020 election and bemoaned the \u201cappalling\u201d treatment of rioters who were taken into custody after storming the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. \u201cThe jails are filthy, dirty. They are living in hell. They are being hounded like you hound the worst animal. \u2026 If we think they\u2019re innocent we should help them defend themselves,\u201d Trump told the crowd. If Trump\u2019s midterm involvement pays dividends in November, people in his orbit say, it is increasingly likely that he will mount a comeback presidential bid in 2024. Three Trump advisers said his behavior in public and private over the past four months has left them with the impression that he does plan to run again as long as he thinks he can win. One of those indicators is Trump\u2019s increased outreach to pollster Tony Fabrizio, who compiled a 27-page autopsy after the 2020 election that detailed which demographics had drifted away from Trump and sought to explain the reasons for those shifts. \u201cHe started bugging Tony once Biden got under 50% approval. Trump sees him as an honest broker,\u201d said one Trump adviser. Fabrizio did not return multiple requests for comment. The theory among Trump\u2019s allies is that the former President will run in 2024 if Biden\u2019s approval rating is still hovering in the low 40s next spring because, Trump and his team believe, that would indicate a loss of support for Biden among independent voters. Biden\u2019s approval rating stood at 42%, compared with 53% disapproval, among all adults in the latest CNN Poll of Polls last week, which is the average of the four most recent nonpartisan national surveys. Won't-run-if-Trump-runs question leads to waiting game for likely 2024 candidates \u201cBut if Biden is back up to 46% approval or above, everyone is universally in agreement that Trump is out,\u201d said the Trump adviser. There are many other potential roadblocks to a successful 2024 White House bid by the former President. New York Attorney General Letitia James is still investigating Trump as part of a civil fraud probe related to his business dealings, while the former President also remains under criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office. Then there is the House select committee investigating Trump\u2019s role in the January 6 riot, which could eventually make a criminal referral to the Justice Department if the committee discovers evidence of wrongdoing on Trump\u2019s behalf. Should Trump proceed with a presidential campaign anyway, his team would be able to activate a significant fundraising operation that the former President and his allies have created since he left office. Trump has already amassed a nine-figure war chest, according to his most recent federal filings. He is also working to develop a new social media outlet \u2013 Truth Social \u2013 that could further increase his reach heading into a presidential contest, though a website about the venture provides few details about its launch and some of his aides fret about its impact. \u201cThe past year has proven he does not need Twitter or Facebook to maintain his influence, and he\u2019s arguably better off without access to social media,\u201d said one of the people close to Trump. Of course, Trump\u2019s first year out of office has done far more than raise questions about a potential upside to his social media banishment. Following a period of uncertainty about his political future in the immediate aftermath of January 6, during which the former President was briefly seen as a pariah among most Republican leaders, GOP movers and shakers began trickling back into Mar-a-Lago\u2019s gilded hallways. Top voices in the party like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California huddled with the former President in Florida less than a month after the deadly Capitol insurrection. Graham was spotted golfing with Trump last April, three months after he had claimed \u201cenough is enough\u201d on the evening of January 6. Another one of the 'Trump 10' heads for the exits Meanwhile, Republicans who have refused to embrace Trump once again have faced his repeated condemnations and active attempts to recruit primary challengers against them this fall. Of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump last January, three have said they aren\u2019t running again this November, four are facing Trump-backed primary opponents and the remaining three are plowing ahead in their quests for reelection. One of those Republicans facing a primary threat, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, has perhaps become the top target of Trump\u2019s attacks. The former President\u2019s contempt for Cheney, who serves as the vice chair of the January 6 panel, is second only to his dislike of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican who has not spoken to Trump in more than a year and is now the subject of an unofficial litmus test for all GOP candidates seeking the former President\u2019s endorsement. In the coming months, Trump is expected to campaign for Wyoming attorney Harriet Hageman, whose primary challenge to Cheney he endorsed in September. Trump\u2019s crusade against Cheney is one of many intraparty feuds he has stoked over the last year. His push to oust the Wyoming Republican from her House leadership post last spring created friction between some conservative lawmakers and McCarthy over the rush to replace her with Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who was endorsed by Trump for the leadership slot. Similarly, his increasingly hostile attacks on McConnell have pitted Republican senators and candidates against one another. In a Fox appearance last week, for instance, Graham delivered an ultimatum to McConnell despite being a longtime ally of the GOP leader. \u201cHere\u2019s the question: Can Sen. McConnell effectively work with the leader of the Republican Party, Donald Trump?\u201d the South Carolina Republican told host Sean Hannity. \u201cI\u2019m not going to vote for anybody that can\u2019t have a working relationship with President Trump, to be a team, to come up with an America First agenda \u2026 because if you can\u2019t do that, you will fail.\u201d Furthermore, Trump\u2019s relentless focus on the 2020 election has forced many Republicans to walk a fine line while campaigning for reelection. On one hand, they must navigate the reality that GOP voters have overwhelmingly accepted Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the election. In September, a CNN poll found that 78% of Republicans don\u2019t believe Biden earned enough legitimate votes to defeat Trump. But candidates in more purple states and districts need to also draw support from moderate Republicans and independents to secure reelection. \u201cA lot of these guys are damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t,\u201d said a person close to Trump, claiming that most Republican candidates who want to be successful \u201cmust find ways to please both Trump and voters who could give a rat\u2019s ass about 2020.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s doable but tricky,\u201d this person said. Some Trump aides are hopeful that his days of relitigating the 2020 election are numbered, or that at the very least he is gravitating toward a more forward-looking message. They grasp onto recent appearances where he has said an election like 2020 cannot \u201chappen again,\u201d suggesting that such language is his way of putting his loss in the past. Part of the reason for this, according to one Trump aide, is that his exposure to 2022 polling has increased since aides implemented a new structure to his endorsement process. Whereas the former President used to back whichever candidate was first to request his support \u2013 either directly during a visit to Mar-a-Lago or indirectly through a Trump ally \u2013 he now reviews a packet of up-to-date polls and field research curated by his team before meeting with most candidates, the aide said. \u201cHe\u2019s literally seeing what works and what doesn\u2019t, and usually the polls show that voters are more interested in what a candidate is going to do about the economy, inflation (and) vaccine mandates than they are hung up about 2020,\u201d said a Republican strategist who has briefed Trump in the past couple of months. The evolution of Trump\u2019s political machine from a hamstrung operation to one that is influencing candidates\u2019 messaging and raking in significant cash each month will be put to the ultimate test in November. If the midterms result in the Republican Party\u2019s return to power on Capitol Hill, Trump allies say, it will help ease the pain of his 2020 defeat and could allow him to retire from politics on a positive note. But it could also be the tipping point for a 2024 bid that rebuilds or irreversibly damages Trump\u2019s legacy, depending on the outcome. \u201cWhether the president decides to run, he will either be the king or he will be the kingmaker,\u201d said McLaughlin, the Trump-aligned pollster.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is facing weak support among Republicans for his calls to depose Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and aides and allies say it\u2019s forcing the former President to confront new limitations on his influence over the party. In the 11 months that have passed since Trump first called for the Kentucky Republican to be ousted \u2013 suggesting shortly after his second Senate impeachment trial ended that it was time for the \u201cunsmiling political hack\u201d to be voted out of office \u2013 McConnell\u2019s authority among Senate Republicans has neither waned nor has he faced the onslaught of blistering attacks from GOP hopefuls that Trump has been pining for. Most candidates who have nabbed Trump\u2019s endorsement have refused to declare war on McConnell, who remains a powerful fundraiser and influential party figure in his own right, while those who are still angling for the former President\u2019s support have also stopped short of staking out opposition to the powerful senator from Kentucky. Trump\u2019s ineffective attempt, thus far, to challenge the top Senate Republican has forced him to temper his criteria as he aims to be a kingmaker in this year\u2019s midterm elections, according to multiple people close to the former President who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. Why Republicans aren't likely to lose any Senate seats in 2022 Some of his aides have warned him that requiring unequivocal opposition to McConnell to secure or maintain his support is incompatible with his broader objectives \u2013 a warning that Trump himself appears to be considering. The former President has not rescinded his endorsements of candidates who have stopped short of opposing McConnell and previously earned Trump\u2019s support, and he continues to privately consider endorsements for other candidates who have openly mused about reelecting McConnell if they make it into the Senate, according to a person familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking. \u201cIn working for Trump for a while now, this is going to be a litmus test for him. But at the end of the day, whether a candidate says he won\u2019t vote for McConnell as leader or is generally critical of current party leadership is likely to be considered one and the same,\u201d said one Trump adviser. The modified condition comes as numerous Senate Republican hopefuls who have cozied up to Trump in pursuit of his endorsement have either sidestepped questions about McConnell altogether or declined to rule out supporting his reelection as leader if they make it through their primaries and the general election. In the Alabama Senate primary, where Trump has endorsed ultraconservative Congressman Mo Brooks, a Brooks campaign aide said the candidate\u2019s position has not changed since he told Politico in early December that he would back McConnell for another two-year leadership term \u201cif he\u2019s the most conservative.\u201d In North Carolina, Trump\u2019s preferred candidate, Rep. Ted Budd, has declined to answer questions about McConnell\u2019s leadership abilities. Budd campaign spokesman Jonathan Felts pointed to a statement he made last month that artfully dodged any criticism of McConnell by saying the congressman\u2019s \u201conly thought on future leadership elections is that we want to do our part to ensure that the Republican leader is the majority leader.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty consistent on day one on that front,\u201d Felts said. Top Republicans stand up for Rounds after Trump's attack: He 'told the truth' Across several other primaries, Republican candidates have also ignored Trump\u2019s entreaties for McConnell\u2019s ouster. Straddling a desire to earn the former President\u2019s support without jeopardizing potential assistance from the McConnell-linked Senate Leadership Fund later on, they have limited their criticism to veiled barbs at the \u201cestablishment\u201d or refuse to even answer questions about McConnell. In the Senate primary in Ohio, for example, where four candidates are jockeying for Trump\u2019s endorsement, no one has outright said they would decline to reelect McConnell to his leadership post if elected. Candidates Josh Mandel and Jane Timken have danced around such questions, while J.D. Vance has described the Kentucky Republican as \u201ca little out of touch with the base\u201d but also stopped short of saying he would oppose him for leadership. \u201cLook, man, I\u2019ve been the only person in the Ohio Senate race who has actually been willing to criticize leadership \u2026 but I do think we\u2019ve got a ground up problem as much as we\u2019ve got a top down,\u201d Vance told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon during an appearance on his podcast last Thursday. One Trump adviser who requested anonymity for fear of retribution said the Ohio primary \u201cproves that McConnell is impenetrable,\u201d adding that it is \u201ca waste of time for Trump to be channeling all of his anger towards McConnell, who shares his goal of winning back the Senate.\u201d Alaska Gov. Dunleavy accepts Trump endorsement conditioned upon him not endorsing Sen. Murkowski in 2022 \u201cYou have four candidates who would seemingly do anything for [Trump\u2019s] endorsement and yet not one of them is willing to stand up and say, \u2018It\u2019s time for McConnell to go.\u2019 That says a lot about McConnell\u2019s survivability and it also shows that there are limitations to President Trump\u2019s influence,\u201d the adviser said. So far, only two high-profile Senate Republican candidates have sided with Trump in his battle against the senator: ex-Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens, who has accused McConnell of \u201cworking against President Trump and the MAGA movement,\u201d and Alaska US Senate hopeful Kelly Tshibaka, who definitively ruled out supporting McConnell as leader in a statement last month. CNN reached out to a dozen other Senate GOP hopefuls who are running as pro-Trump candidates to see where they stand on McConnell and heard back from only three, all of whom declined to comment. Greitens, who is hoping Republican primary voters will look past the allegations of sexual assault and campaign finance misconduct that led to his resignation as governor in 2018, said it would be difficult for McConnell to redeem himself in his eyes unless he backed \u201cfull forensic audits\u201d of the 2020 election in a handful of battleground states where Trump has erroneously claimed that widespread fraud occurred. \u201cThis is a very hard call that US senators are going to make,\u201d he said of supporting McConnell in an interview with CNN. Georgia takes center stage as Biden's visit kicks off year of political battles A statement from Arizona US Senate candidate Blake Masters\u2019 campaign underscored how difficult the situation has become for Republican hopefuls who wish to earn Trump\u2019s endorsement without drawing McConnell\u2019s ire. \u201cBlake will only vote for leadership that is serious about going on offense and actually legislating an America First agenda. He\u2019ll meet with anyone running for leader, including Mitch McConnell, and will vote for whoever is most serious about not just stopping the left\u2019s agenda, but also advancing our own,\u201d the statement read. At least one Senate candidate who was recruited and endorsed by Trump has also received McConnell\u2019s backing and is not expected to turn against the Senate minority leader, according to a person close to his campaign. Georgia\u2019s Herschel Walker, the retired NFL running back who is challenging Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, was endorsed by Trump last September after the former President urged him to enter the race and \u201cis considered a reasonable exception\u201d to his litmus test on McConnell, according to a person close to Trump. McConnell endorsed Walker in late October, describing him as \u201cthe only one who can unite the party, defeat Senator Warnock and help us take back the Senate.\u201d Some of Trump\u2019s allies said his calls for McConnell\u2019s ouster stem from a personal vendetta against the Republican leader and therefore they doubt that he will religiously enforce a litmus test against GOP candidates who decline to oppose McConnell but otherwise fully embrace the former President and his agenda. They consider this a relief, noting that not all GOP voters share Trump\u2019s frustration with the minority leader and most Republican candidates who make it beyond primaries will need institutional support, like that of the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund, to defeat their Democratic opponents. \u201cThere are still a lot of folks who respect McConnell in the party. McConnell is not where Trump thinks he is among the GOP base. The party as a whole doesn\u2019t all hate him. He\u2019s not like [Democratic House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi,\u201d said a former Trump campaign official. Another person close to the 45th President suggested that where Trump sees \u201ca broken old crow, other Republicans see a dedicated public servant who helped put three conservatives on the Supreme Court and got a massive tax cut through Congress\u201d (Trump has nicknamed McConnell \u201cold crow\u201d in numerous statements condemning the minority leader). \u201cMitch McConnell did a great job getting President Trump\u2019s judges into the judicial branch. That was a major accomplishment of the Trump administration and McConnell did a good job helping him,\u201d said Greitens. \u201cI do think, though, when you look at the totality of his record, he\u2019s been a disaster for the America First movement.\u201d The former Trump campaign official said the main difference between Trump and McConnell is that the Kentucky Republican is \u201cself-aware enough to recognize that some candidates will have to make him a target in order to shore up the base and he won\u2019t take it personally.\u201d \u201cMcConnell understands politics better than most and knows that folks are going to come after him a bit because attacking the permanent Washington political class is good politics in certain parts of the country,\u201d the official said. What's on the agenda for Congress in 2022? There is little doubt that candidates who are vying for Trump\u2019s endorsement in competitive primaries would boost their chances of securing it if they declared their opposition to McConnell once and for all, but there is also little doubt that doing so could cost them critical donor support and the financial backing of groups like Senate Leadership Fund and the National Senatorial Campaign Committee post-primary. Senate Leadership Fund and another McConnell-linked group known as American Crossroads spent a combined $462 million in the 2020 cycle and are expected to make significant investments in this midterm cycle as well. One adviser to a high-profile GOP Senate candidate told CNN that he and other campaign operatives he knows are afraid of losing out on support from McConnell\u2019s political machine and believe their candidates can win their primaries without going after the minority leader. \u201cMitch McConnell has been a player in Republican politics for decades. He has contacts, donor relationships and alliances that simply cannot be rivaled and we have to ask ourselves if it\u2019s really worth pissing off a guy like that when there are other things we can do, and have been doing, to prove that we will advance an America First agenda with or without McConnell\u2019s help,\u201d the campaign aide said. What began as an isolated confrontation last year after McConnell blamed Trump for the deadly US Capitol riot on January 6 has since evolved into a steady series of hostile attacks by the former President against the top Senate Republican. Republican candidates across the country refuse to acknowledge Biden won legitimately Trump has torched McConnell over his support for President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which the Senate passed in August and Biden signed into law in mid-November. The former President has repeatedly slammed McConnell for supporting the massive infrastructure investment, which eluded Trump during his time in office, suggesting that the minority leader and other Republicans who got behind the legislation \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves.\u201d And Trump has criticized McConnell for cutting a deal with Senate Democrats to end a December standoff over increasing the federal government\u2019s debt limit. \u201cHe has all the cards to win, but not the \u2018guts\u2019 to play them. Instead, he gives our country away, just like he did with the two Senate seats in Georgia, and the presidency itself,\u201d Trump charged in a statement last month. Trump\u2019s attacks on McConnell escalated last fall, when he began discussing ways to dethrone the GOP leader with other Republican senators and some of his top allies, according to a person involved in the effort, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal in September. But Trump struggled to find much support for the move inside the upper chamber, this person said. \u201cHow this guy can stay as Leader is beyond comprehension \u2013 this is coming not only from me, but from virtually everyone in the Republican Party,\u201d Trump nevertheless claimed in a December statement.",

            "article_content": "Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was remembered by a host of top Democratic politicians at his memorial service in Las Vegas on Saturday, with President Joe Biden hailing the Nevada Democrat as someone who \u201cwould always have your back\u201d and former President Barack Obama recalling him as a fighter \u201cwho did not give up.\u201d Reid, the scrappy former Democratic Senate leader who spearheaded epic legislative battles throughout three decades in Congress, died in December at age 82 following a four-year battle with pancreatic cancer. His service honored his love of family, with all five of the late senator\u2019s children speaking; his love of Nevada, the state he helped put on the political map during his decades in office; and the central role he played in ushering in some of the most significant pieces of legislation of the last two decades. Obama cast Reid as the consummate pragmatist, someone willing to work \u201cwith folks he didn\u2019t agree with or particularly like\u201d in order to get things done. At a time when \u201cso often compromise is portrayed as weakness, Harry had a different view,\u201d Obama said, recalling how the former Democratic leader \u201cdid not believe in highfalutin theories or rigid ideologies\u201d and \u201cmet people where they were, not where he wanted them to be.\u201d \u201cYou wanted Harry in the foxhole with you. His willingness to fight by my side, to stick with me even when things weren\u2019t going our way\u2026 his willingness to be there and fight would last throughout my presidency. It is a debt to him that I could never fully repay,\u201d Obama said. The words from Obama served as a timely message to Democrats in Congress, with progressive and moderate lawmakers quarreling over Biden\u2019s agenda and dividing the party. Throughout the service, those closest to Reid paid tribute to his unlikely life. A child born into abject poverty in a tiny speck of a town called Searchlight, he went on to become the most powerful politician in Nevada history, helping to turn the Western state into a Democratic stronghold that last backed a Republican president in 2004. The upbringing defined Reid\u2019s career, turning him into a champion of the impoverished working-class families like he grew up with in the Nevada desert. Biden remembered Reid as someone whose \u201ctoughness was distinctly Nevadan\u201d and whose \u201cstory was unmistakably American.\u201d \u201cIt was all Searchlight \u2013 no spotlight,\u201d Biden said, adding later, \u201cHarry Reid will be considered one of the greatest Senate majority leaders in history. \u2026 For Harry, it wasn\u2019t about power; it was about the sake of power. It was about the power to be able to use power to do right by people. That\u2019s why you wanted Harry in your corner.\u201d The memorial service unfolded on a picture-perfect day in the Las Vegas valley, with Reid\u2019s flag-draped coffin carried in by an honor guard under a cloudless blue morning sky. His 19 grandchildren served as honorary pallbearers. \u201cPeople know his story. He lived the American Dream, you could say \u2013 from Searchlight to Washington,\u201d his son Leif Reid said. \u201cFrom my time as a young boy, it even then seemed fictional. But the reality was that he was a man who simply chose to do his best every day, to do his duty, to take care of his stewardship.\u201d A giant electronic billboard towering over the Las Vegas Strip paid honor to Reid with the message: \u201cNevada Born. Nevada Leader.\u201d Reid, a practicing Mormon who neither drank nor gambled, was a pioneer of the city that transformed during his time in office. A fierce partisan, for sure, but Reid also had close relationships with other city elders, including the late casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, one of the biggest Republican contributors in American politics. Representatives from Adelson\u2019s office were on hand for the Saturday service, along with local GOP officials and Republican senators including Richard Shelby of Alabama, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Susan Collins of Maine. Hand-drawn signs thanking Reid were hanging on a fence outside the funeral, which also was heckled by more than a dozen protestors carrying Trump banners. In addition to Biden and Obama, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer spoke at the memorial service, recalling both comical and poignant stories about their former colleague. Pelosi recalled how she told Reid that she wanted to host a large dinner when he was retiring. Reid responded, \u201cSave the money, feed the poor,\u201d Pelosi recalled. Pelosi also recalled how she never heard Reid speak ill of any of his Senate colleagues. Speaking after Pelosi, Obama jokingly corrected the Speaker. \u201cI heard Nancy Pelosi say she never heard Harry say anything bad about any of his colleagues. I don\u2019t know about that Nancy \u2013 but he would work with them! I love Nancy, but I,\u201d Obama said, trailing with a laugh. This is Harry Reid's biggest legacy Ahead of the memorial, Reid\u2019s wife Landra Gould said she and her family were \u201chonored to have such a distinguished group paying tribute to Harry\u2019s life and accomplishments. \u2026 These are not only some of the most consequential leaders of our time \u2013 they are also some of Harry\u2019s best friends.\u201d Brandon Flowers, the lead singer of the Las Vegas-founded band The Killers and a frequent fixture at big campaign events for Reid over the years, performed the poignant \u201cBe Still\u201d and the Nevada state song, \u201cHome Means Nevada.\u201d The legendary songwriter and musician Carole King also performed. Reid was remembered on Saturday as a product of Nevada and as a man whose political career grew with the state he called home. When Nevada went from one congressional district to two after the 1980 census, Reid ran for a newly created congressional district around Las Vegas in 1982 and won the general election. He was reelected in 1984. He then successfully ran for Nevada\u2019s open Senate seat in 1986. He rose through the leadership ranks there, serving as the chamber\u2019s Democratic whip from 1999 to 2005. From 2005 through his retirement in 2017, he served as his party\u2019s leader in the Senate, through Democrats\u2019 time in both the minority and the majority. Obama eulogizing Reid was a full circle moment for the duo. Reid, then as the Democratic leader in the Senate, urged then-Sen. Obama to run for president long before he was seen as a presidential contender. After Obama won, Reid became his greatest ally in the Senate, helping to shepherd key pieces of legislation through the legislative body. \u201cWithout Harry we would not have passed the Recovery Act. \u2026 Without Harry we wouldn\u2019t have saved people\u2019s jobs. \u2026 Without Harry we would not have passed Wall Street reform. \u2026 Without Harry, there would be no Affordable Care Act,\u201d Obama said, adding that Reid \u201cgot things done.\u201d",

He is the author and editor of 24 books, including, \u201cThe Presidency of Donald J. Trump: A First Historical Assessment.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The results are in: Democrat Mary Peltola has defeated former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in their House race, a loss that could mark the end of Palin\u2019s political career. The fact that a Democrat won in Alaska, a state that has gone Republican in every presidential election since President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s landslide 1964 defeat against Sen. Barry Goldwater won\u2019t sit well with GOP party elders. But Palin\u2019s political legacy will endure. The former Alaska governor was a pivotal figure in mainstreaming a new style of Republican politics that ignored traditional guardrails. Her brand of conservative populism weaponized social and cultural outrage and mobilized working class Americans. Palin, in short, mastered Trumpism long before Donald Trump ever set foot in the White House. The then-Alaska governor\u2019s few months as Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential running mate in 2008 was time enough to create a template that has been used ever since in conservative campaign politics. In creating the current playbook, Palin borrowed liberally from the smashmouth partisanship employed by former Speaker Newt Gingrich. But she took his combative, corrosive approach to a whole new level. Many establishment Republicans initially were excited about Palin. They hoped a dynamic female governor would energize McCain\u2019s flagging campaign. During her convention speech, Palin, formerly mayor of the Alaska town of Wasilla, took a swipe at her Democratic opponents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for what she portrayed as an elitist tendency to \u201clook down\u201d on blue collar Americans. \u201cI guess a small-town mayor is sort of like a community organizer, except that you have actual responsibilities,\u201d Palin said, lobbing an insult at Obama, who, before becoming a US senator representing Illinois, worked in grassroots activism. Opinion: What to do with Trump's tax returns Her no-holds-barred campaign was a master class for younger Republicans in how to \u201cgo there\u201d without ever retracting a thing. She started to attract a new kind of presence at campaign rallies, where people held up signs questioning Obama\u2019s ethnic background, accusing him of being a terrorist on signs that employed racist imagery. During the campaign, Palin enjoyed some time as her party\u2019s most electrifying figure, overshadowing McCain. But things quickly turned. During a series of interviews, she revealed herself to be stunningly uninformed on crucial issues. She was lampooned mercilessly for her assertion that it was possible to see Russia from Alaska. Television viewers were taken aback by her inability to name even a single newspaper or magazine that she read with regularity. As comedians mocked her \u2013 Saturday Night Live featured Tina Fey playing Sarah Palin, sometimes spoofing her using transcripts from actual interviews \u2013 Palin lashed out against what she called a \u201clamestream media\u201d that was out of touch with real voters and biased against the right. Even as she was enduring incoming criticism, Palin \u2013 like any good acolyte of Newt Gingrich \u2013 understood that it was effective politics to make the most blistering charges possible, even if the accusations veered from the truth. The temperature on the campaign trail became so heated that at one notable moment, McCain felt the need to fact-check a supporter who expressed suspicion that Obama was \u201can Arab.\u201d The Arizona senator corrected her, saying that his Democratic opponent was \u201ca decent family man and citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that\u2019s what this campaign is all about.\u201d McCain would later regret what his campaign had turned into. The Arizona lawmaker, who returned to the Senate after his loss to Obama, died a decade later, in 2018, his centrist politics rejected by his party. But in the years since their defeat, Palin has remained on the national stage, a star player in conservative media and reality television, which has helped preserve her voice in right-wing politics. Indeed, Palin has perfected the art of disseminating baseless information taken from social media, circumventing mainstream outlets that maintained tighter editorial standards. She once famously accused President Obama of creating \u201cdeath panels\u201d through his Affordable Care Act, the health care bill which was his signature domestic policy achievement. Opinion: Bombshell report deals another blow to the Supreme Court's reputation According to Steve Schmidt, who at the time was a prominent Republican campaign adviser for President George W. Bush, \u201cShe would say things that are simply not true, or things that were picked up from the internet. And this obliteration of fact from fiction, of truth from lie, has become now endemic in American politics.\u201d Palin was a key figure when the Tea Party took hold in 2010, delivering keynote rallies and endorsing candidates to give the new renegades legitimacy. She was one of the first Republicans of national standing who railed against the Republican establishment for ignoring the new generation of conservatives. \u201cThe bigwigs in the machine,\u201d she warned, \u201cthey\u2019re driving me crazy because they\u2019re too chicken to support the Tea Party candidates. The ideas of the Tea Party movement are the American ideals that will put us back to work.\u201d And she was a big supporter of the Birther movement, praising Trump for elevating the spurious questioning of the legitimacy of the nation\u2019s first Black president. When Trump \u2013 the biggest Birther of all \u2013 decided to run for president, Palin was early to endorse.  As Mary Trump, the niece from whom Trump is estranged, argued, Palin\u2019s turn in the limelight helped to \u201csoften the ground\u201d for politicians who were \u201cmore openly extreme like Donald.\u201d Palin unleashed some extraordinarily toxic elements into the body politic, and they never disappeared. The Tea Party carried them forward on Capitol Hill and Donald Trump brought them to the world stage with his presidency. Only time can tell how long the staying power of the toxic changes wrought by Palin will be. But there is no putting the genie back in the bottle.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cIf at eighty,\u201d novelist Henry Miller wrote, \u201c\u2026you have your health, if you still enjoy a good walk, a good meal (with all the trimmings), if you can sleep without first taking a pill, if birds and flowers, mountains and sea still inspire you, you are a most fortunate individual and you should get down on your knees morning and night and thank the good Lord for his savin\u2019 and keepin\u2019 power.\u201d Similar thoughts about being \u2013 or soon becoming \u2013 an octogenarian must surely come to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who\u2019s 82, former President Donald Trump, who\u2019s 76, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who\u2019s 80, and President Joe Biden, who turns 80 today. All four were in the news last week, with their political futures at issue. Pelosi chose to step down as leader of her party after it narrowly lost control of the House. Trump announced he\u2019s running for president again. McConnell fended off a challenge to his GOP Senate leadership. And Biden, whose party scored an unexpectedly good performance in the midterms, has said he will decide in the next few months whether to make good on his intention of running again in 2024. \u201cThe verve and drive of older leaders is admirable at an age when many people are long retired \u2013 and an example to society that the elderly are just as capable and worthy as younger generations,\u201d wrote Stephen Collinson for CNN Politics. \u201cYet the prominence of the seventy-and-eighty somethings at the top of the political tree does also raise questions about whether it is healthy that younger politicians are not at this moment in American history taking more responsibility or have more power.\u201d In corporate America, \u201cgenius\u201d is often seen as a substitute for the experience of age. Elon Musk, a 51-year-old who\u2019s the richest person in the world, has been called a genius for his entrepreneurial skill at Tesla and SpaceX and even for his ambition to go to Mars. Yet \u201cMusk\u2019s actions since taking over Twitter on Oct. 27 have been so destructive to the platform\u2019s functioning and reputation that the question is raised of whether, rather than being a genius, Musk is in fact an idiot,\u201d wrote Michael Hiltzik in the Los Angeles Times. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s extreme. But it\u2019s proper to examine how and why someone so unquestionably successful in his business career thus far has gone off the rails now.\u201d While others are leaving Twitter (read Roxanne Jones\u2019 recent take), David Perry would really like to stay. \u201cTwitter changed my life in ways both sublime and ridiculous, profound, beautiful, professional and sadly often terrible,\u201d he observed. \u201cAnd now, due seemingly to the chaotic, often cruel, whims of a billionaire, the whole edifice seems about to collapse.\u201d On Saturday, Musk cited an online poll as he reinstated Trump\u2019s Twitter account, lifting the permanent ban the platform imposed after the January 6, 2021 Capitol riot. Sam Bankman-Fried, the 30-year-old who went from lionized billionaire to reviled executive of a bankrupt company within a few days, is a vaunted \u201cgenius\u201d now under a harsh light. Writing in the New York Times, Paul Krugman cited the story of Bankman-Fried\u2019s company, FTX, to question the future of crypto finance: \u201cThe government supervises banks, regulates the risks they can take and guarantees many deposits, while crypto operates largely without oversight. So investors must rely on the honesty and competence of entrepreneurs; when they offer exceptionally good deals, investors must believe not just in their competence but in their genius.\u201d \u201cHow has that been working out?\u201d Word that the Democrats kept control of the Senate had to be an ego boost for Biden, who met with China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, in Bali, Indonesia, on Monday. As Frida Ghitis noted, \u201cThe timing could not have been any better\u2026\u201d \u201cWith democracy suddenly looking like it\u2019s on firmer ground and key autocracies facing serious problems, it was an ideal moment for Biden to speak frankly to Xi about areas of disagreement between the two superpowers while trying to build safeguards to prevent the rivalry from careening into conflict as the relationship has deteriorated to its most tense state in decades.\u201d But life may get especially uncomfortable for Biden early next year. \u201cWith Republicans in control of the House,\u201d Julian Zelizer wrote, \u201cthe Biden administration will likely encounter a combination of investigations, conservative-agenda setting and obstruction. \u2026 Despite all the media speculation about whether the election will push Republicans away from Trumpism, the safe bet is that \u2026 they will dive deeper into the sea of red.\u201d Still, the Republicans could overreach and give Democrats an opening. Zelizer recalled the maxim popularized by the Spider-Man franchise: \u201cWith great power comes great responsibility.\u201d Former Rep. Charlie Dent, a Republican, observed, \u201cAssuming Kevin McCarthy manages to win the vote for the speakership on the House floor in January, his governing challenge could prove much more frustrating and difficult than what John Boehner faced a decade ago.\u201d \u201cHouse Republican votes will be needed to raise the debt ceiling, fund the government and enter into other agreements with the Senate and President Joe Biden,\u201d Dent noted.  The \u201celection outcome has made McCarthy\u2019s task not only more difficult but perilous. McCarthy has no breathing room, as extreme elements within the House GOP conference feel emboldened with their leverage.\u201d For more: David Axelrod: Nancy Pelosi will be remembered as a political star The Senate race in Nevada was a nailbiter that ended with the re-election of Catherine Cortez Masto, guaranteeing Democrats continued control of the Senate. She \u201ccampaigned vigorously throughout the Silver State, running a textbook campaign, even earning endorsements from high-profile Republicans throughout the state who praised her bipartisan leadership, work ethic and integrity,\u201d wrote Sheila Leslie, a Democrat and former state legislator in Nevada. \u201cThis was in contrast to (Republican Adam) Laxalt, who many viewed as a carpet-bagging Virginian, capitalizing on his grandfather\u2019s sterling reputation in the state.\u201d One Senate seat remains to be decided: Georgia will choose between Democratic incumbent Raphael Warnock and Republican football legend Herschel Walker in a December 6 runoff. The state\u2019s outgoing lieutenant governor, Geoff Duncan, a Republican, urged Walker to make three calls \u2013 to Trump, urging him to stay out of the contest, to Gov. Brian Kemp, seeking his help after the governor\u2019s decisive reelection victory and to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who handily beat challenger Charlie Crist in his reelection. \u201cIf the GOP can\u2019t best a Democratic Party led by a president with an approval rating in the low 40s, something must change because the status quo isn\u2019t cutting it,\u201d Duncan wrote. As for GOP leadership in the Senate, Rick Scott failed in his attempt to oust McConnell from the party\u2019s top post. Patrick T. Brown, a fellow at a conservative think tank, applauded McConnell\u2019s victory and called Scott \u201cthe perfect example of a Republican politician who has seemingly learned all the wrong lessons from the Trump earthquake of 2016.\u201d Yet he argued that some of McConnell\u2019s critics have a point: \u201cMcConnell, who was reelected to his seventh term as senator in 2020, will be needing to hand the reins off at some point soon \u2013 and the younger voices are right to look for a leader who can tell America not just what the Republican Party is against, but what it is for.\u201d For more: Mark Zandi: A divided government will be disastrous for the US economy David Axelrod: Why Democrats\u2019 Senate win in Nevada may be a blessing in disguise for the GOP Jennifer Rodgers: Special counsel on Trump won\u2019t calm the political waters Kara Alaimo: How to build a new generation of Biden-McCain friendships On the day Trump announced his 2024 presidential run, one of his administration officials had a simple question for Republicans: \u201cAre you tired of losing yet?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s move on from Trump \u2013 or rest assured we\u2019ll be having this same conversation in the days following the 2024 presidential election,\u201d wrote Gavin J. Smith. As a candidate, Trump promised Republicans, \u201cWe\u2019re going to win so much. You\u2019re going to get sick and tired of winning.\u201d But after Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, Republicans have fared poorly in national elections. \u201cWe must ask ourselves: Will we continue to be the party of divisiveness and conspiracy theories, dominated by the likes of Trump, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and failed-Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake? Or will the Republican Party finally part ways with them?\u201d Four days before election day, Kari Lake, the Phoenix news anchor turned MAGA gubernatorial candidate, said at a rally, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any McCain Republicans in here, do we. Alright, get the hell out. Boy, Arizona has delivered some losers, haven\u2019t they?\u201d As Jon Gabriel wrote, trashing backers of the late Sen. John McCain was a huge mistake. \u201cMcCain Republicans overlap with those who crossed party lines to support President Joe Biden, turning the state blue in 2020. They tend to be centrist, business-friendly, middle- to upper-middle-class folks who live in the nicer neighborhoods of Phoenix and its close-in suburbs. They want lower taxes, efficient government and absolutely no drama.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t make up the majority of the party \u2013 not by a long shot \u2013 but they exceed that single percentage point Lake needed to best (Democrat Katie) Hobbs.\u201d \u201cThey heard Lake\u2019s call to \u2018get the hell out,\u2019 and did as they were told.\u201d Lake\u2019s defeat is understandable, as was Doug Mastriano\u2019s loss in Pennsylvania\u2019s gubernatorial race, Christopher Beem observed. \u201cA majority of voters have had enough of the performative chaos and spurning of norms that have roiled our politics and our polity since Trump came down the escalator more than seven years ago. Never far from mind is the other unforgettable image that bookended his presidency: the scene of mayhem at the US Capitol, overrun by his supporters and their grievance-fueled violence that he stoked.\u201d \u201cThis midterm election, voters rejected all of that.\u201d Jill Filipovic\u2019s flight to Lisbon in the spring of 2020 was one of thousands cancelled in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThat\u2019s understandable \u2013 I didn\u2019t expect to board a flight during a global pandemic,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut given that the flight didn\u2019t fly, I did expect my money back. For more than a year and a half, I didn\u2019t get it, despite messages and calls to both TAP (Air Portugal) and Expedia. Eventually, in December 2021, I received a partial refund, though still far below the full cost of the ticket.\u201d So Filipovic was pleased to hear the US Department of Transportation was taking action. \u201cSix airlines have been forced to issue $600 million in refunds. The DOT is also fining the airlines $7.25 million for flights that were canceled during Covid and not refunded.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about time this industry saw some consequences. The airline industry posted record profits this past summer, while also canceling and delaying a huge number of flights. When an industry is failing at doing its one job properly and yet is still making money hand over fist, there\u2019s a big problem \u2013 and it\u2019s one being borne by consumers.\u201d Cases of respiratory syncytial virus, known as RSV, are surging in the US, wrote epidemiologist Syra Madad. \u201cFor most people, RSV causes mild, cold-like symptoms, typically lasting for a week or two. But for infants, young children, the elderly and those with a weakened immune system, it can be dangerous, leading to dehydration, bronchiolitis and pneumonia.\u201d Madad\u2019s own 2-year-old daughter recently came down with the disease. \u201cIt started with Laila becoming clingy and irritable \u2013 a telltale sign for me that she\u2019s about to come down with something. Shortly after, she had a runny nose and congestion. A day or two later, Laila spiked a fever of 103 degrees that continued for nearly two-and-a-half days, accompanied by a decreased appetite, and a whole lot of congestion and coughing (not to mention sleepless nights for both her and me). By day five, she was on the mend and feeling better \u2013 or so I thought. Then came on the viral rash.\u201d Madad\u2019s piece includes information on when to seek urgent care for children who develop RSV.

It was a reminder of the challenges involved in managing the resources needed to support human life while also contending with the consequences of burning vast amounts of fossil fuels. Two years ago, Salesforce co-CEO Marc Benioff and Jad Daley, head of the nonprofit American Forests, helped launch a global effort to plant one trillion trees by 2030 as a way to absorb carbon emissions. \u201cWhen we joined with countries, companies and NGOs two years ago to launch the global partnership 1t.org, we knew it would not be a panacea for climate change. Leaders across the forest-climate movement, including ourselves, have always made clear that the most important step we must take to fight climate change is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d The effort has been criticized by those who warn \u201cagainst pretending that planting trees is a permanent climate solution, concerned that reliance on trees will slacken other climate efforts. Others have worried that planting the wrong trees will lead to forests that are less resilient and less biologically diverse.\u201d But, Daley and Benioff argued, \u201cit would be a profound mistake to ignore or diminish the indispensable role that protecting and growing trees can play in addressing climate change. In the United States, for example, our forests captured approximately 13% of gross US greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. In addition to protecting our existing forests, there are millions of acres across America where we can plant and grow more trees, such as reforesting burned areas and planting trees in urban areas.\u201d As poet Tess Taylor reminded us days before Thanksgiving, \u201cThe holidays are coming.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Patrick T. Brown is a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank and advocacy group based in Washington, DC. He is also a former senior policy adviser to Congress\u2019 Joint Economic Committee. Follow him on Twitter. The views expressed in this piece are his own. View more opinion on CNN. In a town full of politicians, many of whom seem to care more about getting on cable TV than the art of legislating, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky stands out. His tenure as Senate Republican leader has been marked by a tight grip over the caucus and a mastery of legislative minutia. From obstructing progressive goals under then-President Barack Obama to holding the line on the Supreme Court seat formerly held by Justice Antonin Scalia, many conservative wins can be attributed to the 80-year-old Kentuckian who clearly places political efficacy over personal popularity. At the same time, his relatively narrow ambition has never made him a heartthrob of the more-ideologically committed wings of the party. Instead of trying to marshal his caucus around a positive vision for his party, McConnell has tended to savvily, if cynically, assess that voters want a party that first and foremost promises to halt the excesses of the other side. According to Axios, for example, McConnell told party leaders and donors last year that putting out policy priorities in advance of the 2022 midterms would be a mistake. It\u2019s no accident a major biography of McConnell is called \u201cThe Cynic.\u201d In the wake of this month\u2019s disappointing midterm election, McConnell\u2019s leadership has lost its appeal for some on the right. Elected Republicans looking for a villain to blame for Senate losses in Arizona, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania, and unwilling to test the wrath of the man whose endorsement swayed the nomination in those states, have set their sights on McConnell. Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas and other conservative activists called for his reelection as Senate Republican leader, usually a formality, to be delayed. Opinion: I worked for Trump, and I won't be supporting his 2024 reelection bid Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, a former health care executive and Florida governor, made no secret of his desire to wrest control of the Republican caucus from McConnell, and picked up a major endorsement from former President Donald Trump on the way. On Wednesday, his longshot bid was unsuccessful. Republicans who care about developing an agenda that appeals to voters \u2013not to mention their party\u2019s political future \u2013 should be grateful Scott\u2019s attempt came up short. In the short term, it means keeping an effective, if bloodless, leader at the helm. Yes, many would like to see a more pugilistic style, but no one can gainsay McConnell\u2019s deft knowledge of Senate procedure, including his commitment to preserving the filibuster against then-President Donald Trump\u2019s call to end it. Meanwhile, Scott\u2019s tenure as head of the Republican Senate campaign arm raised serious questions about his leadership, with expensive gambles costing millions and senators calling for audits into where the money was spent. Scott, in turn, has charged McConnell with poor decisions that led to the disappointing midterms results, and blamed his predecessors for outsized spending. More fundamentally, Scott is the perfect example of a Republican politician who has seemingly learned all the wrong lessons from the Trump earthquake of 2016. Earlier this year, he sought to establish himself as a thought leader with an 11-point plan for a Republican agenda. The document was heavy on culture war bombast, but also suggested Congress should \u201cstop spending money on non-essential state and local projects until the budget is balanced,\u201d refuse to raise the debt limit, \u201csell off all non-essential government asset, buildings, and land,\u201d and force every federal piece of legislation to expire after five years. Opinion: Why Democrats' Senate win in Nevada may be a blessing in disguise for the GOP \u2014 and the nation Most famously, he initially sought to have the half of Americans who don\u2019t pay federal income tax have some \u201cskin in the game.\u201d As Democrats and Sen. McConnell himself pointed out, that would mean a tax hike on many working-class Americans, something that flies in the face of traditional Republican messaging and priorities. On top of that, requiring Social Security and Medicare to come up for a vote every five years would crater the GOP\u2019s credibility with seniors. Scott\u2019s is a vision of government that has more in common with the Ayn Rand-inspired libertarianism that fueled prior generations of the GOP than the more working-class friendly ideas that have begun to reshape the party over the past six years. The tensions on display this week foreshadow a bigger divide that will face the Republican Party. It was no accident which Senators were loudest in calling for a leadership vote \u2013 the younger, more populist ones, several of whom seek a more working-class friendly agenda like pro-family tax credits or supporting more non-college pathways to work. Trump and Scott, on the other hand, wanted a new hand at the reins to more faithfully execute a MAGA-influenced approach to Capitol Hill politics. But the Scott approach would be for the Republican Party to double down on unpopular economic priorities, like those in his 11-point plan, and to try to pour them into the new wineskins of aggressive culture war rhetoric.  McConnell, who was reelected to his seventh term as senator in 2020, will be needing to hand the reins off at some point soon \u2013 and the younger voices are right to look for a leader who can tell America not just what the Republican Party is against, but what it is for. In many respects, the state of Florida\u2019s two senators offers very different directions for where the party may go. Scott\u2019s vision for the party would have embraced MAGA overtones to advance toxically unpopular economic policies. His Sunshine State counterpart Rubio, however, has been engaged in the work of fleshing out a new agenda for the GOP. His time in office, and resounding election-night win, shows the potential of marrying smart cultural populism with an agenda that actually responds to the needs of working-class parents, and shows how Republicans can play a constructive role in helping guide federal policymaking. A vision like that should be what guides the GOP in the future.",

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Comedian Dave Chappelle is making headlines for his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d monologue in which he joked, among other topics, about Kanye West\u2019s recent antisemitic comments. Chappelle\u2019s barbs on the subject included tongue-in-cheek advice on how West should have handled the resulting firestorm, and a quip about the decision by sneaker manufacturer Adidas to drop the rapper as a business partner. But comments he made about former President Donald Trump deserve even more attention than the ones about Ye. And they should serve as a wake-up call for anyone who thinks the former President is going to quietly fade away. Chappelle pivoted about halfway through his 15-minute opening monologue to the topic of Trump, remarking that \u201cI\u2019m watching the news now, (and) they\u2019re declaring the end of the Trump era.\u201d He then melded his acerbic comedy with a simple truth that everyone wishing Trump would disappear from the political landscape needs to hear: Trump\u2019s base hasn\u2019t come close to abandoning him. \u201cI\u2019m just being honest with you, I live in Ohio amongst the poor whites,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cA lot of you don\u2019t understand why Trump was so popular (and) \u2026 very loved.\u201d Chappelle \u2014 who acknowledged in his monologue that he\u2019s a Democrat \u2014 then delivered a comedic explanation for why Trump is adored by his followers. He joked that Trump was an \u201chonest liar\u201d who told the unvarnished truth about a system set up to help the rich and powerful. And he recounted how Trump openly admitted as much during a 2016 campaign debate: \u201cHe said, \u2018I know the system is rigged because I use it.\u2019 \u201d The comedian then joked about how Trump, accused during that debate by Hillary Clinton of not paying taxes, shot back: \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Chappelle shared that for many working-class Americans struggling to makes end meet, Trump\u2019s \u201chonesty\u201d in revealing that the rich and powerful have been taking full advantage of a system designed for their benefit only enhanced his stature. The damage Kanye West is doing is devastating Now, we can debate all day why people really \u201clove\u201d Trump. Was it for the reasons Chappelle suggested? Or was it that, for some, there is a perverse appeal in his bigotry and defense of white nationalists? Is it his \u201cowning the libs\u201d? His tax cuts that greatly favored the wealthy? It may be a mix of all those reasons \u2014 or entirely different ones. But there\u2019s no disputing that in polls taken before last week\u2019s election, Trump was far and away the top choice of Republicans to be their 2024 presidential nominee. A New York Times/Siena College poll found in mid-October that 49% of Republican voters favored Trump as the party\u2019s 2024 presidential nominee. His  closest rival, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, got 26% support. That poll was taken before the GOP came up short in the midterms. Since then, many in the party are blaming Trump for Republican candidates\u2019 lackluster performance at the ballot box, noting that the high-profile candidates he endorsed lost key, marquee races. Trump\u2019s most notable losses span the country, from US Senate candidates Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania and Blake Masters in Arizona, to his choices for governor in battleground states such as Michigan and Wisconsin. Stop obsessing over where trans kids use the bathroom Still, there is no reason to believe that core Republican voters will be dissuaded from supporting Trump despite last week\u2019s election debacle for which he has been roundly blamed. Trump was still the top 2024 choice of the GOP base despite his botched handling of the response to the Covid-19 pandemic (as polls in 2020 showed), and his role in riling up the crowds responsible for the January 6 attack on the Capitol. If his base has overlooked all that, it\u2019s hard to imagine that all his supporters will abandon him just because Republicans didn\u2019t get the \u201cred wave\u201d they were expecting. There\u2019s another deeply concerning reason why Trump\u2019s support will not simply evaporate. As historian and expert on autocracy Ruth Ben-Ghiat explained in a 2021 interview, Trump is an authoritarian leader who has developed a cult-like following. Trump has \u201cfollowed the authoritarian playbook with propaganda, with corruption, with incitements to violence,\u201d she said. This makes Trump\u2019s bond with his supporters unlike anything we are accustomed to seeing in American politics. And in an article she penned last year for The Economist, Ben-Ghiat said that Trump\u2019s \u201cinfluence will not dissipate until the institutions of democracy formally confirm misconduct, for example with a court conviction.\u201d That is why in her view \u201cit is so important to hold Mr. Trump accountable.\u201d  But who knows if Trump will ever be \u201cheld accountable\u201d and what the impact would be on his supporters if he ever were to be? Doing so may make his followers cling to him even more tightly \u2014 despite what millions of Americans, including even some Republican officeholders, may want. Given reports that Trump is expected to announce his 2024 presidential run this week, I\u2019d predict that he won\u2019t be going away any time soon, even without having delivered the \u201cred wave\u201d his supporters had so fervently hoped for.",

The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN. \u201cA new class of thieves has emerged who want to steal our freedom,\u201d Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro thundered during a speech last June. The beleaguered leader, who has been trailing badly in recent polls ahead of Sunday\u2019s election, went on to declare that \u201cif necessary, we will go to war\u201d against the offenders. Who are these thieves Bolsonaro vows he\u2019ll wage war against? Is he speaking about the white-collar and petty criminals he vowed to eradicate when he came to power in January 2019 on an anti-corruption platform? No, like many other authoritarian politicians who risk being ejected from office, the Brazilian President is focusing on unsubstantiated election \u201ccrimes\u201d \u2013 and casting doubt on the integrity of the election system, so as to be able to falsely claim fraud at the ballot box in the event of a loss. If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Bolsonaro \u2013 who, like his peer, former US president Donald Trump, has taken political guidance from famed right-wing ideologue Steve Bannon  \u2013 seeks to make Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d strategy his own, as he faces off Sunday against the popular former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, candidate of the progressive Worker\u2019s Party. Trailing Lula, as his rival is known, by 13% in the polls, largely as a result of his incompetent performance as president and the allegations of corruption within his government and family, Bolsonaro appears compelled to seek an anti-democratic electoral solution to hold onto power. Brazilians have good reason to feel disenchanted with how Bolsonaro has governed over the past four years. After his negligent handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, he was accused by a Brazilian Senate committee of \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d His despoiling of Brazil\u2019s precious Amazon rainforests  made him even more deeply unpopular. Through it all, his stock response has been to make Trump-like intimations of political violence if the elections don\u2019t go his way. He even has gone so far as to proclaim that he will never relinquish the presidency alive. Brazil's presidential vote is just days away. Voters are comparing it to 'war' But Brazilians, who know only too well what it means to lose their democratic rights, seem unpersuaded by his threats. Brazil endured more than 20 years of military dictatorship, (1964 - 1986) \u2013 a brutal, violent regime that Bolsonaro, a former Army captain, has repeatedly praised. That harrowing experience with dictatorship explains the extraordinary efforts by civil organizations and opposition groups to ensure that the election system, which in Brazil is overseen by the federal electoral courts headed by a Supreme Electoral Tribunal, functions as it should on election day. Another key goal of those who would safeguard Brazil\u2019s democracy is to reassure voters that the election outcome will be fair. Since few strongmen can get away these days with outright banning elections, the challenge is to game the election system and destroy its credibility in voters\u2019 eyes. Congress rejected Bolsonaro\u2019s quest for a return to paper ballots (Brazil\u2019s electronic voting machines have repeatedly been judged fraud-free). Election officials, meanwhile, working with civic groups and technology experts created a \u201ctransparency commission\u201d to spread best practices. Business leaders and other influential people have made public pronouncements about the security of elections. Far from being a hotbed of election fraud, all of this makes Brazil  a case study on efforts to counter the 21st century authoritarian playbook. But there is a wild card: Brazil\u2019s military. Bolsonaro has given the armed forces more power than at any time since the dictatorship, staffing his government with a high number of military officials and appointing an army reserve general to lead Brazil\u2019s state-owned energy conglomerate, Petrobras. As payback, and perhaps to advance its own anti-democratic agenda, the military has often supported Bolsonaro\u2019s claims about Brazil\u2019s dubious election system. Who could forget the machinations of Trump loyalists after the 2020 election, with the then-President\u2019s operatives and allies plotting to seize voting machines, and retired General Michael Flynn suggesting that the US military could declare martial law and \u201cre-run\u201d the election? Imagine how much greater the skepticism, if not outright apprehensiveness, about potential election interference by the military in a country like Brazil, where the generals have ruined democracy in the past.  And yet, for Sunday\u2019s presidential balloting, Brazil\u2019s armed forces will be involved in election security, making \u201cspot checks\u201d of hundreds of voting stations on election night of voting machines and comparing those results with the data sent to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. Let\u2019s hope that that is the extent of their participation in the election. Military coups and anti-democratic actions, including in Brazil, have always been justified as \u201csaving the country\u201d from tyranny and corruption. We can all hope that Brazilians will repudiate a president who stands for the darkest and most violent period of its past.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jodi Enda is a political journalist and a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress. A former White House correspondent, she was the editor in chief of ThinkProgress and an assistant managing editor at CNN, where she oversaw the 2016 election book, Unprecedented: The Election That Changed Everything. The opinions in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. How will we know when Rudy Giuliani hits rock bottom? Hailed as a hero for his calm leadership following the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, Giuliani learned this week that he is a target of a criminal investigation into efforts to overturn the will of Georgia\u2019s voters in the 2020 presidential election. In the two-plus decades since he earned the sobriquet of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor,\u201d Giuliani has been involved in so many dodgy, questionable and just-plain-weird incidents that he has become a favorite of late-night talk show hosts and Saturday Night Live impersonators. He has become a caricature of himself, but it is Giuliani alone \u2013 not the comedians who mock him \u2013 who has turned his life into a tragicomedy. The apex of his career is easily pinpointed to the painful autumn of 2001. But what is the nadir? Has it occurred? Or is the one-time-prosecutor-turned-attorney-to-former-President Trump still falling? History is replete with tragic figures (most of them men) who squandered their power or fame or good reputations. There were Aaron Burr, Benedict Arnold (whose very name became a slur), Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee. More recently, we had former President Richard Nixon and non-political figures like O.J. Simpson, Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby, to name but a few. Some would add Donald Trump, but his story is for another day. Giuliani had much to lose when he hitched his wagon to Trump\u2019s star. The power of his mayoralty was over, but he still had a commanding presence in the city he once led. His business dealings brought him wealth; his reputation was smudged but not tattered. Not yet, anyway. Opinion: Trump is worried after FBI search -- and he should be On Wednesday, Giuliani testified for about six hours before a Fulton County, Georgia, special grand jury investigating Team Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn President Joe Biden\u2019s victory in that state. Though his lawyer declined to discuss the content of his testimony, his very appearance in an Atlanta courtroom makes Giuliani the highest profile member of Trump\u2019s inner circle to testify in an election-fraud investigation to date. Giuliani told Georgia lawmakers in December 2020 that he had evidence of voter fraud, claims that the state\u2019s Republican election officials proved false. That he now is a target of the investigation means the former federal prosecutor could be indicted. That would definitely be his lowest point. At least, so far. But, of course, that might not be the end of his legal troubles. And it certainly isn\u2019t the beginning. Last year, a New York appellate court temporarily suspended Giuliani\u2019s law license in response to the false election fraud claims he made in Georgia and a number of other states. Washington, DC, followed suit. He and another Trump lawyer, Sidney Powell, are among those being sued by Dominion Voting Systems for falsely claiming the company rigged voting machines to help secure a Biden victory. What's up with the investigations of and lawsuits against Donald Trump In a bit of good news for Giuliani, it appears he is unlikely to be charged in a federal investigation into whether he illegally lobbied the Trump administration to remove the then-US ambassador to Ukraine, according to The New York Times. The ambassador, Maria L. Yovanovitch, figured heavily in Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial. Still, his ongoing legal troubles represent a stunning fall from grace for a former US attorney who made his name battling corrupt politicians, mob bosses and Wall Street titans, a mayor who led the nation\u2019s biggest city through some of its darkest days. In fact, the phrase \u201cfall from grace\u201d is a phrase often found in stories about the trajectory of Giuliani\u2019s career. Even when Giuliani was a respected officeholder, controversy swirled around him. In the fall of 1992, shortly before he ran for mayor, Giuliani was a provocateur in one of New York\u2019s largest riots, when more than 10,000 demonstrators, many of them off-duty police officers, blocked traffic and stormed City Hall while uniformed police stood idly by. The rioters were mostly White, and they were protesting the city\u2019s first Black mayor, David Dinkins. During his two terms in office, violent crime dropped precipitously, as it did in a number of big cities in the 1990s. Giuliani became known for cracking down on squeegee men, shuttering X-rated theaters and essentially making New York safer and more livable for the mostly White people who gentrified Manhattan and populated working-class neighborhoods of other boroughs. The phrase \u201cGiuliani time\u201d became a common refrain among those who were well served by the mayor. It was a bleak time, however, for unhoused people and people of color, particularly Black and Latino youths who often were subjected to stop-and-frisk searches, which years later were declared unconstitutional. Opinion: Trumpism's unlikely home base Giuliani\u2019s legacy was marred further by repeated, heinous incidents of police brutality against Black men. Two police officers were convicted after violently sodomizing Haitian immigrant Abner Louima with a toilet plunger. (One conviction was later overturned.) Four were acquitted after killing Amadou Diallo, an unarmed immigrant from Guinea, who was shot 41 times while standing in the doorway of his apartment building. To many New Yorkers, the episodes confirmed that racism permeated the government and, equally important, that the mayor appeared to be indifferent to it. Was turning a blind eye to police brutality towards Black people rock bottom? Giuliani also was involved in his share of buffoonery, such as a 2000 comedy skit in which he dressed in drag and then-businessman Donald Trump thrust his face into the mayor\u2019s bosom. That was pretty low, but probably not rock bottom. Then came 9/11. Giuliani was President George W. Bush\u2019s guide to the rubble of the Twin Towers, a paternal figure who declared that New York would rebuild and \u201ccome out of this stronger than we were before.\u201d Oprah Winfrey called him \u201cAmerica\u2019s Mayor.\u201d Time magazine made him person of the year. It took a national tragedy, but Giuliani met the moment and reached the pinnacle of his success. And he was right: New York would rebuild, but primarily under Giuliani\u2019s successor, Michael Bloomberg, who took office Jan. 1, 2002. Opinion: Trump is worried after FBI search -- and he should be Sometime after the accolades waned, Giuliani\u2019s slide began. There were two contentious divorces, one of which he announced publicly before telling his wife. (His first marriage ended in annulment after 14 years on the grounds the couple were second cousins.) There was a short-lived 2008 presidential run (in which he once answered his third wife\u2019s call during a campaign speech) and an aborted 2020 Senate race. There was a lucrative business that came under scrutiny for representing Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin and later for work involving Ukraine. Bumps in the road, but not rock bottom. Giuliani returned to the public sphere in 2016, when he joined the Trump campaign and played an outsize role. \u201cI\u2019m not so sure Trump\u2019s president without Rudy,\u201d former campaign CEO Steve Bannon told Rolling Stone. After the Access Hollywood tape was made public (something many people thought would be Trump\u2019s low point), Giuliani routinely volunteered to go on news shows to defend him. Giuliani wanted to be secretary of state in return, but that never came to pass. Instead, Giuliani became Trump\u2019s personal lawyer and co-conspiracy theorist. During the 2016 election, he tried to spread the false rumor that Hillary Clinton was ill. In 2020, he posited that China purposefully released the coronavirus. But the biggest, most virulent whoppers of them all were Giuliani\u2019s contentions, repeatedly debunked, that widespread election fraud cost Trump his job. The election lies promoted by Trump, Giuliani and others, grew bigger and wilder as time went on. Ultimately, they provoked Trump loyalists to travel to Washington on January 6, 2021, the day Congress was set to certify Biden\u2019s election. That day, Giuliani told thousands of Trump supporters gathered on the Ellipse that Vice President Mike Pence, who would oversee the certification, had the authority to send the election back to the states. That was false. He then stood by while Trump exhorted his followers to march to the Capitol. People died. Democracy hung in the balance. Rock bottom?  Of course, as any Giuliani-watcher knows, he also has had less serious (some would say laugh-out-loud) low points. For instance, there was the time he stuck his hands down his pants in a Borat movie. Or the time he shaved his face in an airport restaurant. There was that bizarre, conspiracy-theory-laden press conference in the parking lot of Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia. Perhaps the most embarrassing Giuliani moment occurred when a dark liquid that appeared to be hair dye dripped down his face during a news conference intended to call attention to (non-existent) voter fraud. Great late-night fodder, but probably not rock bottom. But now things are serious for the wide-eyed former mayor. Now there could be legal consequences in Georgia and possibly elsewhere. Perhaps Giuliani has finally hit rock bottom. Or perhaps one of the myriad investigations of election fraud will lead to a new low. Criminal charges, imprisonment, a lifetime of ignominy? It\u2019s hard to know just how far from \u201chero\u201d Giuliani might fall.",

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. After everything Donald Trump has done \u2013 from his seemingly open embrace of bigotry to his failed handling of Covid-19 (which polls show most Americans were critical of) to his efforts to thwart democracy \u2013 it\u2019s hard to believe that anything could siphon off the support of the former President\u2019s die-hard acolytes. But a new editorial published by the New York Post, \u201cTrump\u2019s silence on Jan. 6 is damning,\u201d should worry him, given the newspaper\u2019s reach with a loyal pro-Trump audience and its status as one of the crown jewels of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s media empire. The conservative-leaning daily is not some random anti-MAGA publication; rather it gave Trump a full-throated endorsement when he ran for reelection in 2020 while saying a Joe Biden administration \u201cwould be beholden to a socialist left.\u201d The New York Post is a tabloid that reaches Trump voters where they are. The newspaper, founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton, has a reputation of appealing to working-class readers. In 2021, the Post described itself as the sixth-largest newspaper in the United States, saying more than 80 million people read its online content each month. One thing about the New York Post that should concern Trump is something from his own playbook: It doesn\u2019t hold back when it slams people \u2013 even someone like the ex-President whom it once championed. The paper is known for using clear, direct language and powerful framing \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what it deployed in its editorial crushing Trump. The editorial began: \u201cAs his followers stormed the Capitol, calling for his vice president to be hanged, President Donald Trump sat in his private dining room, watching TV, doing nothing. \u201cFor three hours, seven minutes.\u201d The missing piece in the January 6 hearings The Post spelled out the time in hours \u2013 instead of saying \u201c187 minutes\u201d the way lawmakers did at Thursday\u2019s House committee hearing \u2013 to delineate more clearly the amount of time that elapsed from the moment Trump ended his speech on January 6 to when he finally released a video at 4:17 p.m. urging his supporters to go home. Putting it mildly, \u201cthree hours, seven minutes\u201d sounds far longer than 187 minutes \u2013 the increment of time that most in the political world and the media use to measure Trump\u2019s inaction \u2013 and the Post gets that. From there, the editorial got worse for Trump. In its stinging rebuke, it emphasized that Trump was the only person who could have stopped his angry supporters, but he only made matters worse. \u201cTo his eternal shame, as appalled aides implored him to publicly call on his followers to go home, he instead further fanned the flames\u201d by tweeting that his vice president, Mike Pence, didn\u2019t have the \u201ccourage\u201d to block the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s Electoral College win. The Post wrote that Trump\u2019s indefensible objective through all of this was \u201cto find any means \u2013 damn the consequences \u2013 to block the peaceful transfer of power.\u201d Pointing out that the Justice Department must decide about possible criminal behavior, the newspaper\u2019s editorial board concluded that \u201cas a matter of principle, as a matter of character, Trump has proven himself unworthy to be this country\u2019s chief executive again.\u201d Have the January 6 hearings damaged Trump's political prospects? Don't count on it That assessment alone would be troubling for the former President who is reported to be poised to announce plans soon to launch a 2024 election bid to reclaim his old job. But shortly after the New York Post published its piece, the editorial board of another Murdoch publication, The Wall Street Journal, also slammed Trump in an editorial titled \u201cThe President Who Stood Still on Jan. 6.\u201d The Journal wrote that, of all the condemnable behavior by Trump presented by the January 6 committee over the past several weeks, \u201cmost horrifying\u201d was witnesses describing how \u201cas the riot raged \u2026 he sat watching TV, posting inflammatory tweets and refusing to send help.\u201d These editorials align with the chilling story painted by the January 6 committee of a President refusing to act as his supporters brutally beat officers and lay siege to the seat of our nation\u2019s legislature. Trump made no calls to law enforcement or to the National Guard, the committee said. He didn\u2019t convene his staff to figure out ways to stop the attack. He didn\u2019t immediately release a video demanding his supporters go home \u2013 despite pleas from a host of his advisers and Washington officials that he do just that, including his White House counsel and daughter Ivanka. No, he watched the attack unfold on television for hours.  Common sense tells us that if Trump were at all troubled by the attacks waged by his supporters, he would have used his immense power as President to stop them. There\u2019s no \u201cother side\u201d to this story. No ambiguity. In fact, even in his flurry of online posts after Thursday\u2019s hearing \u2013 although he attacked various participants from the hearing \u2013 he did not push back against the charge that he sat on his hands during the attack. One thing is perfectly clear at this point: people either support Donald Trump or they support the United States of America. There\u2019s no overlap. Even the formerly Trump-loving New York Post is telling us that the ex-President\u2019s behavior that day cannot be defended.",

            "article_content": "When Bob\u2019s Pantry and Deli opened for business in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park in 2008, loyal customers lined up in the snow at 4 a.m. to support Bob Crimo, who was striking out on his own after years running a convenience store franchise. Photos from opening day showed customers hoisting massive sandwiches and Crimo posing with his beaming family \u2013 including his eight-year-old son Robert Crimo III, who went by Bobby. The deli quickly became a popular local fixture: a hangout spot for teenagers, a friendly gathering place for the neighborhood, and a pit stop for an affordable, delicious lunch. But behind the scenes, the Crimo family was in turmoil. Police reports show that officers were regularly called to their home over domestic disputes between Crimo and his wife, and in 2019, police briefly confiscated a collection of knives after then 18-year-old Bobby threatened to \u201ckill everyone.\u201d More recently, after the once-bustling deli closed, the family appeared to fall into dire financial straits, with foreclosure cases proceeding against both of the homes they owned and Bob Crimo telling a judge several weeks ago he was on food stamps. Then, as Highland Park prepared to celebrate the Fourth of July this week with the annual parade through the city\u2019s picturesque downtown, Bobby allegedly climbed onto a cosmetics store rooftop with a semi-automatic rifle and opened fire on the festivities, killing seven people and injuring dozens of others. In the wake of the tragedy, the close-knit community of Highland Park is reeling and trying to understand a massacre with no apparent motive. Locals said that it was even more shocking that the shooter was Bobby Crimo \u2013 the son of a well-known local figure beloved by his regular customers, who even ran for mayor several years ago. The elder Crimo is facing scrutiny in part because he sponsored a permit allowing his son to purchase firearms before he turned 21, including the gun he used in the shooting. Locals who once lined up for \u201cNicky D\u201d sandwiches at Bob\u2019s say they can\u2019t comprehend how the family could have missed warning signs, including violent imagery in the music videos Bobby posted online, or why Crimo would have signed the gun permit application. \u201cTo be that irresponsible and signing off is mind-blowing to me,\u201d said Barbara Medina, a longtime Highland Park resident who often shopped at the deli and was marching in the parade when the shooting took place. \u201cIt\u2019s a shock that it\u2019s anybody in your town, that they could come in and do that to their own community.\u201d Crimo did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment, but in an interview with the New York Post, he said he had no idea Bobby was preparing to commit the shooting and that he wasn\u2019t responsible for his son\u2019s actions. \u201cI\u2019ve been here my whole life, and I\u2019m gonna stay here, hold my head up high, because I didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d he declared. More than a dozen Highland Park residents who knew the shooter or his family spoke to CNN about his upbringing, as they tried to piece together how their city had joined the long list of American communities whose names have become shorthand for mass shootings. By all accounts, Bobby Crimo was a quiet kid, who could be seen running around his dad\u2019s shop as he grew up. His father ran the White Hen Pantry, a franchise of a local convenience store chain that became known for its sandwiches. In an affluent lakeside suburb where most shops closed early, the White Hen Pantry was open 24 hours, giving teenagers a safe hangout spot at night. Regulars remembered the elder Crimo as a gregarious, generous presence who would let customers waiting on a paycheck buy food on credit, and who seemed to be manning the counter at all hours of the day and night. Locals described Crimo as \u201cthe mayor of Ravinia,\u201d the local neighborhood where the store was located, who knew all his customers and their regular orders. Crimo could be eccentric: One time, a friend said, he competed with another local restaurant owner to see which business could go longer without replacing any lightbulbs \u2013 until both stores were almost completely dark. Crimo\u2019s shop closed after 7-Eleven bought out the White Hen Pantry chain. But Crimo reopened in a new location under his own name, and his loyal clientele followed. Still, there were signs of trouble in the family. One longtime customer and friend of Crimo\u2019s \u2014 who asked to remain anonymous to speak candidly about the family \u2014 remembered that he and his wife, Denise Pesina, would have heated arguments in the deli, even in front of customers. \u201cIt was awkward for people,\u201d the friend said. \u201cI remember thinking, if that\u2019s the public arguments, I can only imagine the private ones.\u201d Police reports released this week show that the couple\u2019s fights continued behind closed doors. In the six years after the deli opened, officers were called to their home at least a dozen times to settle domestic disputes or respond to allegations that one or the other was intoxicated. In one 2010 incident, Crimo alleged that Pesina \u201chad hit him with a screwdriver on the left forearm\u201d \u2013 before recanting once he got to the police station \u2013 and in another, he claimed she hit him on the head with a shoe. \u201cHe threatens to call the police for any and every argument we get in,\u201d Pesina wrote in one handwritten witness statement. \u201cHe says he wants the police to think I\u2019m crazy.\u201d Ex-FBI official questions key decision by shooter's father There is no record that any of those incidents led to criminal charges against either Crimo or Pesina. The two separated at some point, according to friends, with Pesina staying in their Highland Park home and Crimo moving to his father\u2019s home in neighboring Highwood. Bobby lived in both homes over the years. Pesina had had another brush with the law as well: In 2002, when Bobby was nearly two years old, she was arrested for child endangerment after allegedly leaving him in a locked car at a Toys-R-Us parking lot for about 27 minutes on a 79-degree day with the windows rolled up, according to court documents. Pesina pleaded guilty to misdemeanor child endangerment, and completed a year of court supervision. Pesina did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. Her lawyer at the time, Steven Lunardi, said that she admitted having made a mistake. Jeremy Cahnmann, who taught Bobby and his brother in an elementary after-school sports program, said the boys stuck out in his memory because their parents almost never picked them up on time. \u201cI remember talking to faculty at the school about how uninvolved the parents were,\u201d he said. Bobby was \u201calways the kid there at the end who didn\u2019t get picked up.\u201d At school, Bobby kept to himself, with former classmates of the future gunman describing him as an odd, soft-spoken kid who showed little interest in class, school activities or his peers. But he explored a different side of his personality with rap songs and music videos he posted online \u2013 some of which included troubling imagery. Molly Handelman, who attended middle school and high school with Bobby, described him as a \u201cvery quiet\u201d guy. \u201cWhen he did talk, he was very soft. He didn\u2019t seem aggressive ever, at all,\u201d she said. Uncle of Highland Park shooter asked if he would have signed gun card. Hear his reply Handelman, who worked with Bobby on class projects a few times, said \u201csomething definitely seemed off\u201d about him. \u201cHe made it very clear he didn\u2019t care about school,\u201d she said. Another former classmate who asked not to be named due to privacy concerns said he and Bobby used to hang out, play video games and skateboard together in middle school. \u201cHe would make YouTube videos all the time back then,\u201d the classmate said, \u201cDIY videos on how to grip a skateboard or replace a wheel, stuff like that.\u201d But in high school, the former classmate said, Bobby grew more insular and distant. \u201cHe was always by himself,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one seemed to try to be his friend.\u201d According to a school district spokesperson, Bobby stopped attending Highland Park High School in 2016, after his freshman year. It\u2019s unclear whether he went to another school after dropping out. In recent years, Bobby revealed a louder side of himself online, posting music videos he apparently made \u2013 some of which featured ominous lyrics and animated scenes of gun violence. Bobby, who made music under the moniker \u201cAwake the Rapper,\u201d uploaded his music on several major streaming outlets and on a personal website. In one video titled \u201cAre you Awake,\u201d Bobby sports multicolored hair and face tattoos and declares, \u201cI need to just do it. It is my destiny.\u201d The video shows a cartoon animation of a stick-figure man resembling Bobby in tactical gear, carrying out an attack with a rifle. In another video, a similar stick-figure cartoon character resembling Bobby is depicted lying face down on the ground in a pool of his own blood, surrounded by police officers with their guns drawn. And in a third, Bobby is seen wearing a helmet and a tactical vest and dropping bullets onto the floor of a classroom. As Bobby was struggling in school, his father\u2019s business was also having trouble staying afloat. Regular customers said that they noticed more of the shelves in the store going empty, and the hours it was open shrinking. In conversations with friends, Bob Crimo complained about a downturn in the business, increases in rent, and fees he said he had to pay the city. In 2018, Crimo settled on a solution: running for mayor of Highland Park. People who knew him said they were puzzled about why he would embark on what seemed like a quixotic campaign against the popular incumbent, Nancy Rotering, who was Bobby\u2019s former Cub Scout leader. In a local news profile, Crimo talked about making the city more business-friendly, but he didn\u2019t seem to actively campaign, and it\u2019s unclear how seriously he took the race. State records show Crimo didn\u2019t receive any campaign donations other than a $560 loan from himself, which he spent on yard signs. In the end, Rotering won 72% of the vote in the April 2019 election, soundly defeating Crimo. In another blow, Crimo\u2019s deli shuttered around the same time. Google Street View photos show that while the shop had a big \u201cBob Crimo for Mayor\u201d poster hanging in the window in late 2018, by September 2019, the storefront was vacant and empty. According to court documents, the store was under a mountain of debt: A lender sued the deli and Crimo in late 2018, alleging he owed more than $764,000. A judge ruled in the lender\u2019s favor by default in March 2019 after Crimo failed to appear in court. It\u2019s unclear whether the debt was ever paid. Around the same time, Bobby started showing more troubling behavior. In April 2019, according to police reports released by Highland Park, officers performed a wellness check on the 18-year-old Bobby after receiving a report that he had \u201cattempted to commit suicide by machete\u201d a week prior. Mental health professionals handled the episode, officers wrote. Then in September of that year, police received the report that Bobby had \u201cstated that he was going to kill everyone.\u201d Bobby admitted that he was depressed and had a history of drug use, according to the report. His father turned over a collection of 16 knives, a dagger and a \u201cSamurai type blade\u201d to police, and officers sent the Illinois State Police a \u201cclear and present danger\u201d report related to the threats Bobby made. But the state police declined to approve that determination, which could have blocked Bobby from buying guns, because there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to do so, the agency said this week. Just three months later, Crimo signed his son\u2019s application for a Firearm Owners Identification card, a requirement to buy guns in Illinois. Under state law, young adults under 21 years of age need a parent or guardian to sponsor them in order to get the permit. Highland Park shooter's rooftop position made it hard for police to find him quickly as parade turned into chaos, chief says Crimo told the New York Post that he sponsored the application so his son could shoot at a gun range. This week, an attorney for Bob Crimo \u2013 who no longer represents him \u2013 told the Chicago Tribune that Crimo was not aware of the incident that resulted in the confiscation of the knives when he signed the card. Yet, according to the state police, Crimo was actually the one who reclaimed the knives from officers. In the Post interview, Crimo downplayed Bobby\u2019s threats in that incident as a \u201cchildish outburst.\u201d Attorney George Gomez, who is representing both parents, told CNN that \u201cthe family denies that there was any issues of suicide at the time,\u201d and stressed law enforcement found \u201cno safety risk.\u201d Bobby went on to use the card to legally purchase multiple guns before he turned 21 last year, passing a total of four background checks, according to the state police. That included the semi-automatic rifle he used in the shooting. Meanwhile, the family\u2019s finances appeared to unravel in recent years. HSBC Bank filed for foreclosure on their Highland Park house, where Bobby had grown up, in December 2019, alleging Crimo, Jr. owed more than $460,000. The case was delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the lender restarted efforts to take possession of the home last year. In April 2022, a mortgage servicing company filed to foreclose on a second property Crimo owns in the neighboring town of Highwood. The company, NewRez LLC, alleged that he had failed to make payments since July 2020, and owed more than $197,000. In the Highland Park case, a judge granted Crimo a full waiver of court fees in May after he appeared in person and provided proof that he was receiving food stamps, according to court documents. Last Thursday \u2013 four days before the shooting \u2013 Crimo filed a last-ditch motion to block foreclosure of the house, arguing the lender hadn\u2019t given him sufficient notice of being in default or of accelerating the due date for the balance of the mortgage. Paul Crimo, Bob\u2019s brother, who lives with him and worked at his delis, told CNN he didn\u2019t think the financial stress affected Bobby. \u201cMy brother always made sure his kids always had a roof over (their) head at all times,\u201d he wrote in a text message, adding that Crimo \u201cis a great father.\u201d Some of the Highland Park residents who were at the parade when Bobby opened fire said they blamed the father for allowing his son to buy guns. The elder Crimo \u201cshould be held liable for it and responsible for it,\u201d declared Fred Kroll, a three-decade Highland Park resident who attended the parade with his wife and daughter and said he saw multiple people shot dead. \u201cWhether it\u2019s civil lawsuits by the survivors or he goes to jail \u2026 he should be punished.\u201d State officials have poured cold water on the idea of Crimo facing criminal responsibility over the deaths. \u201cThere\u2019s not a criminal liability that\u2019s directly attached to vouching for someone else\u2026 and they end up doing something terrible like this,\u201d said Eric Rinehart, the Lake County State\u2019s Attorney. Gomez said the family is \u201ctrying to cooperate with all local, state, and federal authorities at the moment.\u201d When asked if he felt there was any criminal wrongdoing on part of his clients, particularly the father, Gomez said, \u201cwe take the position that my client, Crimo Jr., did nothing wrong in this case.\u201d Crimo reportedly has said he wants \u201ca long sentence\u201d for his son, who faces seven counts of first-degree murder and a sentence of life in prison, if convicted. Illinois abolished capital punishment in 2011. Still, even Crimo\u2019s friends say they doubt he\u2019ll be able to stay in his hometown, or ever open a business here again. \u201cHis kid shot up his hometown, and he\u2019s going to have to come to terms with that action and, honestly, the role he played in his son\u2019s evolution as a person,\u201d one friend said. \u201cIt was his son\u2019s name on the news \u2013 and that\u2019s his name, too.\u201d CNN\u2019s Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Isabelle Chapman, Curt Devine, Eric Levenson and Jeff Winter contributed reporting.",

In an emotional address to the UN Security Council yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of killing civilians for \u201cpleasure\u201d and warned more atrocities could occur. Zelensky\u2019s speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. Separately, the top US military officer told lawmakers yesterday that the world is becoming more unstable and the \u201cpotential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing.\u201d Later today, the US will announce new sanctions on Russia in coordination with several other nations and the European Union, according to an administration official. More than 45 million people are under an enhanced severe weather threat across the Southeast US this morning, where a powerful storm could deliver a triple threat of wind, tornadoes and flooding. Parts of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and the western Carolinas could see damaging winds and a few tornadoes in the coming days, according to the latest forecasts. A flood watch is also in effect for about 2 million people in the region, with some isolated areas getting around 5 inches of rain. The storm system is hitting the region at an unfortunate time, as most areas remain in recovery mode from recent\u00a0 tornadoes and treacherous thunderstorms. At least two people were killed yesterday by the storms, local officials said. The Oklahoma legislature yesterday passed a near-total ban on abortion, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. The bill would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both. The legislation passed the state Republican-led House by a 70-14 vote, without debate or questions on the floor. The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who previously promised to sign every bill limiting abortion that came across his desk. This comes as several state legislatures have advanced bills restricting abortion access. Last week, Arizona\u2019s Republican governor signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria.

            "article_content": "Three presidents \u2013 one sitting and two former \u2013 descended on Pennsylvania Saturday for a final-stretch midterm push that underscored the stakes of one of the nation\u2019s most closely watched Senate races. For President Joe Biden, who held a rare joint appearance with former President Barack Obama in Philadelphia to boost the Democratic candidate Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, Pennsylvania amounted to a political stress test in his home state, where he\u2019s traveled 20 times since taking office. For former President Donald Trump, who rallied Saturday night outside of Pittsburgh in the city of Latrobe, a win by his hand-selected candidate Dr. Mehmet Oz could prove his own enduring viability in a commonwealth he lost by a narrow margin in 2020.   The consequences extend well beyond next week\u2019s election. As Trump prepares to announce a third presidential bid, potentially in the coming weeks, Biden\u2019s aides are taking their own initial steps toward mounting a reelection campaign. For a several-hour stretch on Saturday, the dynamics of a potential 2020 rematch were laid bare. The moment marks a historic anomaly. Former presidents have typically only waded sparingly into daily politics, mostly avoiding direct criticism of the men occupying the office they once held. Not since Grover Cleveland in 1892 has a defeated one-term president returned to win the White House again. The convergence of presidents in Pennsylvania, each warning of dire consequences should the opposing party prevail, reflected the altered norms Trump precipitated when he took office nearly six years ago, quickly issuing false accusations against Obama of spying and general malfeasance. In North Philadelphia, Biden told a packed crowd at Temple University that Fetterman would protect Social Security and Medicare and would look out for veterans. \u201cMy objective when I ran for president, was to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out. It\u2019s a fundamental shift, compared to the Oz and the mega MAGA Republican trickledown economics,\u201d Biden said, referring to Fetterman\u2019s GOP opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz. As the crowd booed, the president continued, \u201cNo really. This ain\u2019t your father\u2019s Republican Party. This is a different breed of cat. I really mean it. Look, they\u2019re all about the wealthier getting wealthy. And the wealthier staying wealthy. The middle class gets stiffed. The poor get poorer under their policy.\u201d Obama offered a prebuttal to the possibility of Democratic losses. \u201cI can tell you from experience that midterms matter, a lot,\u201d Obama said, a reference to the 2010 election that saw the GOP retake power in the House of Representatives during his first administration. \u201cWhen I was president, I got my butt whupped in midterm elections. I was elected in the midst of a financial crisis and we did the right things to get the economy back on track but it was slow and people were frustrated, just like they are right now.\u201d Biden, who spent much of his first year in office trying to avoid saying Trump\u2019s name, is no longer so cautious. He called out \u201cTrump and all his Trumpies\u201d at a rally in California this week and identified Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as \u201cTrump incarnate\u201d during a fundraiser outside Fort Lauderdale on Tuesday. At his own rallies, Trump plays a video reel of slip-ups to cast his successor as a gaffe-prone senior citizen \u2013 though he hasn\u2019t as frequently gone after Obama. Obama, meanwhile, has issued his harshest criticism to the cast of candidates backed by Trump, many of whom deny the 2020 election results and have modeled themselves after the 45th president. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t just work out just because somebody\u2019s been on TV. Turns out, being president or governor is about more than snappy lines and good lighting,\u201d Obama said in Arizona last week of the Republican gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake, a former local news anchor. Pennsylvania\u2019s senate and gubernatorial contests are the sole marquee races of this year\u2019s midterm cycle Biden has stumped in repeatedly. In other high-profile races, candidates have maintained their distance from a president with underwater approval ratings. That hasn\u2019t been true of Obama, who has been in high demand among Democrats in close races. In the final weeks of the campaign, Obama has held raucous rallies in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada \u2013 all states Biden has avoided in the last several months as candidates work to stave off Republican momentum. That\u2019s a 180-degree turn from midterm cycles during Obama\u2019s presidency, when it was Biden venturing to more states \u2013 including conservative-leaning districts \u2013 where the sitting president was considered a drag on Democratic candidates. Biden is hardly irritated or even surprised that Obama is more of a draw on the campaign trail this year than him, according to officials. He has discussed some of the races with his former boss and believes Obama\u2019s message is both resonating with voters and complementary to his own. Still, their joint appearance Saturday only served to underscore their divergent styles and political abilities \u2013 a comparison even some Democrats say ultimately favors Obama. \u201cI know you always ask me how we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re going to win this time around I think. I feel really good about our chances,\u201d Biden told reporters Friday in California. The president has been bullish on Democrats\u2019 chances next week, even as many Democrats grow increasingly anxious about their party\u2019s prospects. His campaign schedule \u2013 in blue states stumping for candidates in closer-than-expected races \u2013 is itself a signal of Democrats\u201d vulnerabilities. In the final days of the campaign, Biden has been traveling mostly to blue states he won, but where Democrats are nonetheless running closer-than-expected races. He stopped in New Mexico, California and Illinois before stumping in Pennsylvania on Saturday, and will campaign with the embattled New York Gov. Kathy Hochul on Sunday. He\u2019ll spend Election Eve in Maryland. People familiar with Biden\u2019s thinking say he accepts that not every Democratic candidate will welcome him as a surrogate while his approval ratings remain underwater. And he has told fellow Democrats he respects their political intuition when it comes to their own races. But he has grown frustrated at coverage suggesting he is political albatross, according to people familiar with the conversations, arguing his policies \u2013 when properly explained \u2013 are widely popular with voters. Compared to both Obama and Trump, Biden has held far fewer campaign rallies for his party during this midterm cycle. Most of his engagements over the past month have been official events, delivered to crowds that sometimes only number a few dozen. His rallies have begun drawing larger crowds in the waning days of the campaign. Six hundred people had to be turned away from an event in Southern California on Friday, according to the White House. And Biden addressed an overflow crowd in New Mexico that couldn\u2019t fit inside the main venue when he was holding a rally with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham. \u201cI know you don\u2019t think it, but I think we have pretty good crowds. They\u2019re fairly enthusiastic. You don\u2019t write it that way, but they are,\u201d Biden said as he was departing California on Friday. Still, his events haven\u2019t generated the same electricity as Obama\u2019s. The former president has laid into Trump and his acolytes who are running for office during his string of rallies across the country over the past weeks, using stinging humor and an air of bemusement to ridicule Republicans. Like Biden, he\u2019s also argued the American system of government is at stake in next week\u2019s election, telling a crowd in Arizona that \u201cdemocracy as we know it\u201d could perish if election deniers take office. Obama and Biden last appeared together at the White House in September, when Obama\u2019s official portrait was unveiled in the White House East Room. The event had been put off while Trump was in office, partly because neither the Obamas nor the Trumps were interested in putting on a show of friendship. As he campaigns for his endorsed candidates this fall, Trump has made little attempt to conceal his larger intentions: to buttress his own likely presidential campaign he hopes will return him to the White House. \u201cGet ready, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Trump told a crowd in Sioux City, Iowa, on Thursday, adding that he \u201cwill very, very probably do it again.\u201d Top Trump aides have discussed the third week of November as an ideal launch point for his 2024 presidential campaign if Republicans fare well in the midterm elections, sources familiar with the matter said. For Biden, the decision may take a little longer. He has pointed to family discussions around the holidays when asked about his own timeline. Members of his political team have made early preparations for a campaign infrastructure, operating under the assumption he will decide to run again. His motivating factor, aides say: Whether Trump jumps in himself. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "After four straight years of premium declines, Affordable Care Act policies will be more costly in 2023. However, most enrollees won\u2019t feel the increase thanks to enhanced federal subsidies that congressional Democrats were able to extend. The average monthly premium for the benchmark silver plan in 2023 will rise by 4% in the 33 states participating in the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, according to a Department of Health and Human Services report released Wednesday. That compares to a 3% drop for this year. The increase in Obamacare premiums mirrors the trend in employer-sponsored coverage for 2023. Most workers can expect to see premiums and out-of-pocket costs increase at a faster rate than in recent years due to inflation, experts said. Consumers will be able to start comparing Affordable Care Act plans Wednesday when the federal exchange opens for window shopping. Open enrollment launches November 1 and runs through January 15, though folks must sign up by December 15 if they want coverage to begin at the start of the year. The Biden administration is heavily touting the generous subsidies, which will allow four out of five enrollees to select plans that cost less than $10 a month and save enrollees an average of $800 a year in premiums. The assistance helped drive sign-ups for 2022 to a record 14.5 million people, including 6 million people who newly gained coverage. The national uninsured rate has reached an all-time low. The subsidies were originally enhanced for two years as part of the Democrats\u2019 $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan, which passed in March 2021. It made two changes to the subsidies to address long-standing complaints that Obamacare plans are not affordable for many people, particularly the middle class. Enrollees now pay no more than 8.5% of their income toward coverage, down from nearly 10%. And lower-income policyholders can receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums. Also, those earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level are eligible for help for the first time. Democrats scrambled this year to extend the subsidies so that consumers wouldn\u2019t face big premium hikes just ahead of the midterm election. They succeeded in doing so as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in August. The subsidies will now last until the end of 2025. More families will be eligible for subsidies on the exchanges in 2023 after the Biden administration finalized a rule addressing the \u201cfamily glitch.\u201d Under Obamacare, workers who don\u2019t have \u201caffordable\u201d health insurance options through their jobs can qualify for subsidized coverage on the exchanges. A work-based policy is considered \u201caffordable\u201d if it costs the employee less than roughly 10% of his or her income for single coverage. However, until now, the health reform law didn\u2019t take into account the increase in premiums for adding family members to the policy, even if it pushed the cost above the threshold. The rule allows family members of workers who are offered affordable single coverage but unaffordable family policies to qualify for subsidies on the Obamacare exchanges for the first time. About 1 million people are expected to either gain coverage or see reductions in premiums, according to the White House. Some 220 insurers are participating on the federal exchange for 2023, an increase of seven from this year. Roughly 92% of enrollees will have a choice of at least three insurers, up from 89% this year. Also, consumers will find that every carrier must offer a standardized plan, which has a set deductible and out-of-pocket maximum, as well as copays or coinsurance. The deductibles are heftier than in non-standardized policies, but certain benefits, such as generic and preferred brand drugs, primary care and specialist visits, urgent care, mental health and substance abuse outpatient office visits, and speech, occupational and physical therapy will be available pre-deductible. Consumers are encouraged to actively shop for coverage, rather than let themselves be automatically reenrolled in their existing policies. It\u2019s possible that they can get a better deal or that their plan may go up in price for 2023, even with the subsidies. The Biden administration is spending big to make sure people know about Affordable Care Act coverage and the subsidies and get help enrolling in plans. It is providing just under $100 million in funding \u2013 the largest amount ever \u2013 for navigators to assist people in signing up for coverage. The money will help groups retain staff and add to the more than 1,500 navigators who assisted enrollees this year. And the administration is investing in outreach, particularly in communities of color. Americans with historically higher uninsured rates flocked to the exchanges over the past two years, according to a report released Tuesday by the Department of Health and Human Services. Black and Latino consumers saw a 49% and 53% increase in enrollment from 2020, respectively, while American Indian and Alaska Native consumers saw a 32% jump.",

            "article_content": "Democrat Mandela Barnes and Republican Sen. Ron Johnson sparred over their respective ties to the middle class and their views on crime in the second and possibly final Wisconsin Senate debate. Barnes was clearly eager to attack Johnson \u2013 perhaps an acknowledgment that the Democratic lieutenant governor is under more pressure with new polls showing him falling behind the GOP incumbent in the pivotal matchup. Republicans are trying to defend this seat in a state President Joe Biden won in 2020 as they look to flip the closely divided Senate in November. Mandela Barnes has signaled support for removing police funding and abolishing ICE -- despite ad claiming otherwise A Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday found 52% of likely voters backing Johnson and 46% backing Barnes, which was a growing advantage for Johnson after the same poll in September had found no clear leader. Republicans believe their nonstop focus on crime \u2013 with millions in attack ads being run against Barnes \u2013 is the reason for the polling shift, and that strategy was on full display in Thursday\u2019s debate, with Johnson hitting Barnes over the issue from the outset. Barnes attempted to rebut the attacks by personalizing the issue \u2013 noting he lost friends to crime growing up in Milwaukee \u2013 and questioning Johnson\u2019s focus on crime by noting his minimization of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Here are four takeaways from the debate. Johnson followed the strategy of the outside GOP groups that have spent millions hitting Barnes.   \u201cOne thing you have to do is you have to keep violent criminals in jail, and you have to support law enforcement,\u201d Johnson said, suggesting Barnes and Wisconsin Democrats do not. The two-term senator added later: \u201cThe problem with the whole defund movement, which he has been a big supporter of, is it dispirits law enforcement.\u201d Initially, Barnes \u2013 who has argued during the campaign that he does not want to defund the police \u2013 responded by personalizing the crime issue, saying, \u201cIt is absurd to say I am soft on crime, or I am not serious about issues, because there is nothing, I am more deeply passionate about.\u201d But the most direct response on crime came when Barnes invoked the January 6 insurrection, something Johnson has minimized since it occurred. \u201cNo police officers in this country were more dispirited than the ones who were present at the United States Capitol Hill on January 6,\u201d Barnes said, noting that scores of officers were injured. \u201cSo this talk about support for law enforcement, it\u2019s not real, it\u2019s not true, because he decided to play politics when the person he didn\u2019t want to win the presidential election.\u201d Barnes previewed this attack earlier in the day when his campaign launched a new digital ad hitting Johnson over revelations from the House select committee earlier this year that the Wisconsin Republican had tried to pass then-Vice President Mike Pence a false slate of electors during the certification of the 2020 election results on January 6. Johnson claimed at the first debate that he did not know what he was being asked to hand to Pence. Johnson took issue with the attack on Thursday: \u201cAnd I immediately and forcefully and repeatedly condemned the violence on January 6.\u201d In the months following the insurrection, Johnson cast doubt on reports surrounding the riot, telling a conservative radio host last year, \u201cThose were people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law,\u201d and later telling Fox News, \u201cThe fact of the matter is even calling it insurrection, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Johnson wasted no time arguing he is best suited for the job because of his business experience, touting his \u201cfirst taxpaying job\u201d and his family\u2019s business. Barnes took issue with this argument, especially given Johnson\u2019s business experience stems from his wife\u2019s family\u2019s plastics company, PACUR. 'It hurts the business': Wisconsin Senate race could hinge on voters' views of economy, inflation Johnson\u2019s \u201cbiggest achievement in business was saying I do,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cHe married into his business. He didn\u2019t start that from the ground up.\u201d Shortly after that barb, Johnson took issue with Barnes\u2019 personal story, especially how he often refers to how his mother was a teacher and his father worked third shift. \u201cI know others have said their fathers worked third shift,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut I actually worked third shift.\u201d Later in the debate, after Johnson again touted his business record, Barnes quipped, \u201cSenator Johnson is taking a whole lot of credit for his business in law.\u201d Moderators ended the question-and-answer portion by asking the candidates to name something they admired in their opponent. Barnes went first and took the question seriously, complimenting Johnson on being a family man. \u201cThe senator has proven to be a family man and that is admirable,\u201d Barnes said. Johnson largely ignored the prompt. He commended Barnes\u2019 \u201cgood upbringing\u201d and his parents, but quickly pivoted to saying Barnes had \u201cturned against America.\u201d That answer elicited groans and boos from the audience. Johnson shrugged after finishing. This story has been updated with additional information.",

            "article_content": "The National Republican Congressional Committee is canceling all their ad reservations in Ohio\u2019s 9th Congressional District, according to CNN\u2019s ad tracker AdImpact, a sign that Republicans are losing faith in J.R. Majewski\u2019s controversial bid to unseat Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur. The committee had planned to spend over $700,000 on the northwest Ohio race, according to the ad tracker, but cut those reservations just days after The Associated Press reported Majewski had misrepresented his military service. The report appears to have been the final straw for a candidate who was a January 6, 2021, rally participant and has repeatedly shared pro-QAnon material, despite denying he followed the conspiracy theory movement. Majewski responded to the cancellations during a news conference on Friday, directing reporters to ask the committee about why it cut its planned spending. Majewski also pushed back against the AP reporting that he misrepresented his military service, claiming he \u201cflew into combat zones often, specifically in Afghanistan\u201d and that \u201canyone insinuating that I did not serve in Afghanistan is lying.\u201d A spokesman for the NRCC did not respond to a request for comment. With Democrats\u2019 narrow majority in the House, the race between Majewski and Kaptur is key in this year\u2019s midterm battle for control of the chamber. Majewski unexpectedly won the newly drawn district\u2019s Republican primary earlier this year, defeating multiple, and more establishment Republicans, in the process. He rose to Republican prominence for his unflinching support of former President Donald Trump, including by painting his front lawn into a 19,000-square-foot Trump 2020 sign. He later appeared in the MAGA rapper Forgiato Blow\u2019s song \u201cLet\u2019s Go Brandon Save America,\u201d by rapping one verse decrying \u201cwoke\u201d politics after he launched his campaign. Majewski has also said that he raised between $20,000 to $25,000 to bring people to Washington around the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally but says they \u201cwent there to support the President peacefully.\u201d Democrats cheered Majewski\u2019s primary win, viewing him as a weaker general election candidate against Kaptur, who has been in office for nearly 40 years and was widely seen as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country after her district was redrawn to be more Republican. Kaptur has tried to focus her race on her ties to the area, telling CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that being a midwestern Democrat in a party increasingly run with big city sensibilities on both coasts is a growing challenge for her. \u201cWhat coastal people, God bless them, don\u2019t understand, is that we lost our middle class,\u201d Kaptur said. \u201cWe lost so many people who\u2019ve worked hard all their lives, including in many of these small towns. I understand that. We feel their pain. We went through it together.\u201d Trump, who has endorsed Majewski, praised the congressional candidate at a recent rally in Ohio.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden has been celebrating Labor Day in Pittsburgh on-and-off for more than a decade, twice using the city\u2019s parade as a testing ground while he contemplated a presidential run. When he returned to the city Monday, other races were front and center, including Pennsylvania\u2019s increasingly nasty Senate contest. Yet over the coming weeks, Biden\u2019s own political strength will be put to the test as he embarks upon his most intensive in-person politicking since before the Covid-19 pandemic. In Wisconsin and Pennsylvania on Monday, Biden heralded his economic record at events with union crowds. But he also hit back at \u201cextreme\u201d Republicans he deemed \u201cTrumpies\u201d as he endeavors to render the upcoming vote not just a referendum on his own record but a choice between himself and the chaos cultivated by former President Donald Trump. In Pittsburgh, Biden referred to his predecessor simply as \u201cthe former, defeated, President.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s clear which way he wants to look,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s clear which way the new MAGA Republicans are. They\u2019re extreme.\u201d \u201cTrump and the MAGA Republicans made their choice,\u201d he added later. \u201cWe can make ours: We can choose to build a better America or continue down this sliding path.\u201d Earlier, in Wisconsin, Biden sought to differentiate between traditional Republicans and those who have rallied behind Trump. \u201cI want to be very clear up front.\u00a0Not everyone Republican is a \u2018MAGA Republican.\u2019 Not every Republican embraces that extreme ideology.\u00a0I know, because I\u2019ve been able to\u00a0work with mainstream Republicans\u00a0my whole career,\u201d Biden said at Laborfest in Milwaukee to a cheering crowd of union workers. \u201cBut the extreme\u00a0MAGA Republicans in Congress have\u00a0chosen to go backwards, full of\u00a0anger, violence, hate and\u00a0division,\u201d he said. \u201cBut together we can\u00a0and we must choose a different\u00a0path: forward.\u201d Democrats hope to flip two Republican-held Senate seats in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, and their success or failure will be viewed as a key indicator of the party\u2019s \u2013 and Biden\u2019s \u2013 political power ahead of the 2024 presidential contest. Biden\u2019s own political future was the subject of anxious speculation over the summer as the 79-year-old President suffered low approval ratings and a string of setbacks. Biden\u2019s intentions remain a lingering question, though he insists he plans to run again. Pittsburgh was where Biden headed in 2015 and 2018 as he considered previous presidential runs. Marching in the city\u2019s parade those years, he was met with enthusiastic calls of \u201crun, Joe, run.\u201d On his visit Monday, Biden swapped the parade for a union picnic with members of the United Steelworkers. He mingled with the crowd for a stretch before his speech, tossing a beanbag with kids and taking photos. Before emerging into the crowd, Biden met privately with Democratic US Senate candidate, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who suffered a stroke earlier this year that took him off the campaign trail, in their first face to face of the campaign. For much of the summer, it remained an open question whether Biden would be a welcome guest with Democrats or shunned by candidates looking to separate themselves from a historically unpopular president. When Biden visited Cleveland in July to deliver an economic speech, Ohio\u2019s Democratic Senate candidate, Rep. Tim Ryan, declined to attend. He opted to campaign in another part of the state instead. Other Democratic candidates declined to say explicitly whether they wanted Biden to join them on the campaign trial in the fall. \u201cI will welcome anybody to come to Arizona, travel around the state at any time. As long as I\u2019m here, if I\u2019m not up in Washington in session, and talk about what Arizona needs,\u201d Sen. Mark Kelly, running for reelection in Arizona, said on CNN, stopping short of directly asking Biden to come. On Monday, some Democratic candidates appeared eager to appear with Biden. In Milwaukee, he appeared with Gov. Tony Evers, the Democratic incumbent running for reelection against Trump-backed Republican Tim Michels. The Democratic Senate candidate, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, did not appear with Biden, though the President advocated for him during his speech. When Biden spoke last week in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, Attorney General Josh Shapiro, appeared alongside him. And Fetterman\u2019s team confirmed nearly as soon as the White House announced Biden\u2019s trip to Pittsburgh that he would be meeting with the President. During their meeting Monday, which lasted about 15 minutes, Fetterman pushed for Biden \u201cto use his executive authority to begin the process of rescheduling marijuana,\u201d according to a readout provided to CNN by Fetterman spokesman Joe Calvello. They also discussed infrastructure and \u201cthe urgent need to \u2018make more stuff in America,\u2019 strengthen and expand labor unions, and put more power directly into the hands of American workers,\u201d Calvello added. When the two men emerged from the union hall together, Fetterman raised his arms and pumped his fists. But when Fetterman spoke ahead of Biden, he used the opportunity to lambast his Republican opponent, Dr. Mehmet Oz, for owning multiple homes and preparing crudit\u00e9s without mentioning the President. The unofficial kickoff to the midterm campaign season has coincided with a string of policy successes for Biden and his party, easing some of the Democratic pressure surrounding the President\u2019s leadership and political acumen. Biden hopes to use his recent victories to boost Democrats and avoid what once was viewed as an inevitable midterm drubbing. He is also betting the reminder to voters of the dysfunction surrounding Trump will benefit Democrats in November. In Wisconsin, Biden chastised the state\u2019s incumbent Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, a top Trump ally, for downplaying the January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol, where Trump\u2019s supporters sought to disrupt the electoral vote count. \u201cSen. Johnson said it was by and large a peaceful protest,\u201d Biden said. \u201cHave you seen the videos what happened that day?\u201d Speaking in Pennsylvania later, Biden questioned the patriotism of Trump-supporting Republicans who have questioned the results of the 2020 election. \u201cYou can\u2019t say you love the country, when \u2026 you either win, or you have been cheated,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where we are now.\u201d Biden\u2019s advisers have laid plans for the President to travel two or three times a week in the run-up to the November vote. Because his presidential bid was hampered by the pandemic, Biden has not aggressively campaigned in-person since he was competing in the Democratic primary in early 2020. At campaign-style events over the past two weeks, Biden has demonstrated an eager willingness for the trail. During a fiery rally in Maryland, he excoriated Republicans for standing in the way of his agenda, which he touted as transformational for middle class Americans. Later, during an official event in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, Biden called for tougher new gun laws, including a ban on assault weapons, and accused Republicans of fealty to the gun lobby. And speaking at Independence Hall in Philadelphia last week, in what was an official White House event despite the political message, Biden issued a dire warning about \u201cMAGA Republicans\u201d seeking to undermine American democracy, a speech he\u2019d been contemplating for months as he grew increasingly concerned at Trump\u2019s hold on the GOP. Monday\u2019s events signaled a return to a more consistent theme for Biden: The importance of organized labor in building the middle class and strengthening worker protections. Biden\u2019s endorsement from key unions have helped fuel his many political campaigns, support he is consistently looking to repay. In memos and strategy documents prepared over the month of August, Biden\u2019s team spelled out their dual-track midterm message: framing Republicans as extremists and promoting his own list of accomplishments. His stop in Pittsburgh marked his third visit to the commonwealth in the span of a week, and his 16th stop in the Keystone State since taking office. At his own rally in Wilkes-Barre over the weekend, Trump sought to boost his endorsed candidates but spent much of his speech railing against Biden and the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago estate. Trump labeled Biden an \u201cenemy of the state\u201d in his speech, delivered near Biden\u2019s hometown of Scranton. In Boston, meanwhile, Vice President Kamala Harris echoed Biden\u2019s message drawing contrasts with what the White House describes as \u201cextremist\u201d Republicans. \u201cEvery day, workers fight to move our country forward. And yet, we must recognize that there are those in Congress who are fighting to drag us back. In Congress, in statehouses across our nation, extremist, so-called leaders are fighting to turn back the clock,\u201d she said during remarks to the Greater Boston Labor Council\u2019s annual breakfast. \u201cLet\u2019s not let extremist so-called leaders turn back the clock. We know what\u2019s at stake, we know what we stand for, we know when we fight, we win, we love our country, and all of this is worth it,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with further developments on Monday.",

            "article_content": "The House of Representatives voted Friday to pass Democrats\u2019 $750 billion health care, energy and climate bill, in a significant victory for President Joe Biden and his party. The final vote was 220-207, along party lines. Four Republicans did not vote. Now that the Democratic-controlled House has approved the bill, it will next go to Biden to be signed into law. Final passage of the bill marks a milestone for Democrats and gives the party a chance to achieve long-sought policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. It comes at a critical time as Democrats are fighting to retain control of narrow majorities in Congress. The sweeping bill \u2013 named the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes \u2013 including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks \u2013 and boost the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s ability to collect. It would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit. The House took up the legislation after it passed in the Senate following a marathon overnight session of contentious amendment votes. In the Senate, the bill passed on a final, party-line vote of 51-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. Senate Democrats, who control only a narrow 50-seat majority, ultimately stayed unified to pass the legislation. And they used a special, filibuster-proof process known as reconciliation to approve the measure without Republican votes. Approval of the bill in the chamber marked a major milestone for Senate Democrats, who had long hoped to pass a signature legislative package, but had struggled for months to reach a deal that had the full support of their caucus. Sen. Joe Manchin played a key role in shaping the legislation \u2013 which only moved forward after the West Virginia Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a deal at the end of July, a key breakthrough for Democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out. Arizona Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema was also at the center of the effort to pass the bill \u2013 and Sinema, Manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making alterations on the bill. Passage in the Senate came after a lengthy stretch of amendment votes known as a \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d that lasted nearly 16 hours from late Saturday night until Sunday afternoon. Republicans used the weekend \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes. They were also successful in removing a key provision to cap the price of insulin to $35 per month on the private insurance market, which the Senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the Senate\u2019s reconciliation rules. The $35 insulin cap for Medicare beneficiaries remains in place. In the end, Republicans lined up to oppose the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that the bill included \u201cgiant job-killing tax hikes\u201d and amounted to \u201ca war on American fossil fuel.\u201d The Kentucky Republican said Democrats \u201cdo not care about middle-class families\u2019 priorities.\u201d While economists disagree over whether the package would, in fact, live up to its name and reduce inflation, particularly in the short term, the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions. The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. Analysis from Schumer\u2019s office \u2013 as well as multiple independent analyses \u2013 suggests the measure would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to Biden\u2019s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030. The bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles. The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors\u2019 offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. The controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs. Democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way, they wouldn\u2019t expire just after the 2024 presidential election. To boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion. Concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats\u2019 plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear. However, Sinema nixed her party\u2019s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%. The provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers\u2019 profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats. In its place, a 1% excise tax on companies\u2019 stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide. CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers, Ella Nilsen, Tami Luhby, Katie Lobosco and Matt Egan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The White House has been so wrong, so often, on inflation that its latest assurance that the painfully high cost of living has peaked, after more record-busting data, didn\u2019t pass muster \u2013 especially with swing state Democrats in an election year. New statistics on Wednesday showing consumer prices rocketing 9.1% in June year-over-year \u2013 a 40-year high \u2013 dealt another blow to a reeling administration and posed a fresh test of President Joe Biden\u2019s capacity to drag his party out of a deepening political hole. After months of failing to accurately predict the inflationary crisis, the White House was back on a tightrope from which it has often toppled, trying to show Biden feels Americans\u2019 pain but confidently predicting relief is around the corner. Here's what's getting more expensive at the grocery store Biden insisted in a statement that the figures, while \u201cunacceptably high,\u201d were \u201cout-of-date\u201d since they did not properly take into account 30 days of falls in gasoline costs as well as easing prices in commodities like wheat. The President\u2019s claim on the granularity of the figures may well be justified. And Biden is hardly the only Western leader saddled by high prices following pandemic-caused supply chain disruptions exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. But his message was also oddly discordant given the months of frustration millions of Americans have felt. While improvements are possible next month, prices are likely to remain elevated for some time. And since Biden last year said high inflation would \u201cchange\u201d more rapidly than people expected, while his aides were calling high prices \u201ctransitory,\u201d his predictions are unlikely to instill much confidence in imminent relief. In the states that will decide whether Biden faces a Republican House and Senate after the midterm elections \u2013 a scenario that would strangle his domestic program \u2013 the impact of inflation is cutting deep. And it\u2019s opening gaps between Democrats experiencing the harsh political impact of inflation on the frontlines and a White House that has so far failed to tame it or to shape an effective political message to project confidence that it can. Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, an endangered Democrat in November, faulted the administration on its earlier forecasts that the worst of the crisis was already over. \u201cI remember being with a bunch of senior leaders in November, screaming my head off about the price of gas in November and being patted on my head and saying like, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, we got to get through Christmas and it\u2019ll be better in 2022,\u2019\u201d Slotkin told reporters on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think that we have a great sense of where this is going.\u201d Another Democrat from an electoral battleground, Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin, faulted Biden\u2019s argument that the record inflation figures were out of date. \u201cI know that people are really suffering with the inflation and while it is great news that in the last month that gas prices have gone down by about 40 cents per gallon, that\u2019s not really the break people are looking for,\u201d she said. Baldwin is not up for reelection in November but the race for her state\u2019s other Senate seat will help decide control of the chamber in November. What can Biden actually do about inflation? History is a guide One of the most politically damaging characteristics of inflation is that it is felt by every voter, since it hits vital commodities like dairy products, bread, eggs, rent and gasoline and tends to impact less well-off people in a more extreme way. It\u2019s also demoralizing since no one knows when things will improve. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I have any confidence on when the prices are going to go down, so it\u2019s been a little frustrating,\u201d Northern Virginia motorist Kristin Allstadt told CNN\u2019s Brian Todd on Wednesday at a gas station. The corrosive political nature of inflation is being exacerbated by the fact that it hasn\u2019t really been a threat for decades in Western economies, so voters are unaccustomed to it. And because it affects food and gas \u2013 purchases families cannot easily stop making \u2013 it causes considerable anguish and difficult choices. One of the most pernicious impacts of inflation is that in order to fight it, the Federal Reserve may have to use harsh medicine in the form of further interest rate hikes that risk throwing the economy into recession and causing even more discomfort. The inflation crisis is particularly uncomfortable for Biden since he\u2019s always prided himself on maintaining a genuine connection with middle class and blue collar Americans, which is central to his brand. But empathizing with the hurt many voters are feeling and fixing their problems are two different things. The Fed has few options as inflation runs hot The bad news for Democrats is that while Biden is predicting a fall in inflation, it is unlikely to be large enough to offset voter frustration in time for the midterms. The factors causing higher prices, including the war in Ukraine, Covid-19 disruptions in manufacturing hubs in Asia, and high demand and limited supplies are unlikely to ease in the short term. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that there is unlikely to be a quick turnaround. \u201cMy guess is that inflation will be lower next year than it was this year and quite likely will be lower in 2024 than in 2023. But I think is not going to be easy to bring inflation back to the kind of levels we have been accustomed to in recent decades,\u201d Summers said. \u201cWe have let the genie out of the bottle.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s figures came as Biden is out of the country on a trip partially dedicated to persuade Middle East oil producers to increase supply in the hope of precipitating a fall in gasoline prices \u2013 one of the most powerful everyday barometers of citizens\u2019 sense of economic security. The impact of gas prices on Wednesday\u2019s inflation data helps explains why it might be politically smart for Biden to lobby Saudi Arabia, despite branding it a \u201cpariah\u201d over the murder and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018. But when the President was asked in an interview with Israeli television whether the Saudi leg was about oil he replied: \u201cThe trip is about stability in the Middle East.\u201d The White House, conscious of a perception that Biden is begging the Saudis for help, has framed his travel almost as a peace mission as he seeks to lock in a rapprochement with Israel and some Arab states. But Biden\u2019s message conflicted with that of his own economic team, which seems, as inflation rages, to be happy with the perception that the President is seeking relief for Americans. \u201cThe President right now is in the Middle East because he wants to get as much oil on the market as possible,\u201d Cecilia Rouse, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d on Wednesday. 3 reasons not to panic about decades-high inflation \u201cThat is the way we bring down prices,\u201d she said, also referring to a list of measures Biden had taken to lower prices, including easing regulations on ethanol and releasing oil from strategic reserves. While securing more supplies could affect oil prices and filter through to lower prices at the pump, it\u2019s not a certain remedy. And flooding oil markets is unlikely to solve one of the key issues keeping gasoline prices high \u2013 a lack of refining capacity. With prices expected to remain challenging, it\u2019s hard to see how the political vise the economy has put around Democrats will ease ahead of November. A Pew Research Center poll published Wednesday found that three-quarters of Americans were very concerned about rising prices for consumer goods. A similar number felt the same about rising gas and energy prices. Bank of America economists just forecast a mild recession this year that could damage Biden\u2019s top economic achievement \u2013 strong jobs growth. And the President\u2019s political exposure from inflation is not limited to the midterms. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin warned on Wednesday that the new data made him reluctant to support a fresh attempt to revive a scaled-back version of Biden\u2019s social spending and climate change plan. Without Manchin, nothing can get through chamber, where Democrats have a tiny majority. And Wednesday\u2019s inflation figures, whatever nuance and caveats they deserve, were yet another gift for Republicans who can portray it as solely the fault of Biden\u2019s economic policies and Democratic control of Washington. \u201cDemocrats\u2019 one-party rule in Washington has failed hardworking families across America. Just this morning, we learned that Bidenflation hit another 40 year high, soaring to 9.1%,\u201d House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik said Wednesday, calling it \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s energy crisis\u201d in a blunt, even if oversimplified, message likely to inflict great damage on Democrats in November.",

            "article_content": "In a year weighted by\u202fdisappointment for the US climate movement, the lowest low of 2021 might have taken place nearly 3,500 miles away in Glasgow, Scotland, where world leaders gathered early\u202flast\u202fNovember for the largest United Nations climate summit in history. The UN\u2019s COP26 summit had been touted as an opportunity, however slim, to forge an off-ramp from climate catastrophe. Instead, negotiators walked away with another series of ambitious goals and commitments, with no mechanism for enforcement. President Joe Biden \u201cwas supposed to show up with Build Back Better in his back pocket and slam it down on the table and say, \u2018China, India, how do you like them apples?\u2019 climate activist and writer Bill McKibben told CNN, referring to Biden\u2019s ambitious climate and social policy package. \u201cBut he showed up with nothing. And had nothing really to say.\u201d The story of Washington\u2019s failure so far to move major climate legislation with Democrats in full control of government is one fraught with slim congressional majorities, rising economic inflation and the breakout of war in Europe. Underlying it all is what climate activists see as major legislative missteps. Biden was the first president to center his administration around the threat of climate change, but major progress has proved difficult to achieve. The new year has brought unexpected and heightened complications. The global crisis set off by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has further scrambled the politics of clean energy. Biden\u2019s move to ban oil imports from Russia, which is expected to cause even higher gas prices, has the American fossil fuel industry primed to increase output. And though some clean energy advocates are hopeful the squeeze will inspire renewed investment in renewable sources, the administration has been focused in recent days on discussing how to get more oil on the market, which has included the highest-level discussion with Venezuela in years and encouraging increased production from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Even before war seized Europe, Congress\u2019s inability to take the steps scientists agree would offer a baseline for curbing, if not reversing, the climate crisis and sending a statement to other high-polluting countries is a maddening one for a movement that came within spitting distance of a generational victory. 'We really don't have a plan': Biden's climate promises are sunk without Build Back Better, experts say In Glasgow, Biden arrived with the framework of a climate and social spending package the White House said all House and Senate Democrats \u2013 including pro-coal Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2013 had agreed to. But as the international conference took place, Democratic leaders in the US House of Representatives allowed for the passage of a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that \u2013 as many on the left had predicted when they sought to tie it to the Build Back Better plan \u2013 all but eliminated pressure on Manchin to back the President\u2019s signature proposal.\u202fA month later, Manchin announced his opposition to the Build Back Better bill, effectively killing it in a 50-50 Senate, where every Democratic vote would be needed for passage. In the months since COP26, the already fragile climate credibility of the US has been thrown further into doubt. Build Back Better is \u201cdead,\u201d Manchin declared in February. And even though Biden\u2019s climate provisions are one of the few things in the original bill he\u2019s publicly expressed support for, they have\u202flittle momentum behind them. Varshini Prakash, executive director of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate activist group, was among those who had worked for years to create the circumstances for federal action on climate. In an interview, she reflected on what she described as \u201cthis last, laborious, excruciating year.\u201d \u201cWe threw everything that we had at this moment,\u201d Prakash said. \u201cWe got people out to vote for a candidate (in Biden) they weren\u2019t that excited about. We elected climate champions., We did action after action. We showed up at the debates. We pressured people to increase their ambition. We even sat in on policy formations\u201d that secure a beefed-up climate platform for Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. For Prakash and many other activists, Manchin, along with another Democratic holdout on Build Back Better, Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, has emerged as the central villain in the story. \u201cThere was so much that young people did in the last two to three years to set the stage for climate action at the federal level,\u201d Prakash said. \u201cAnd I think in this moment, it\u2019s just very hard to see the way in which all of that has been whittled down to one man standing in the way of that action.\u201d The Sunrise Movement is an early winner in the Biden transition. Now comes the hard part. There is also some frustration among advocates the President\u2019s recent actions. \u201cIt does seem like since then, Biden tried to go back to the old way of doing things,\u201d Evan Weber, a co-founder of Sunrise, told CNN. \u201cHe forced progressives to break their block on passing the bipartisan infrastructure bill, and other things that show a naivete about American politics for a guy who has seen a lot of transformation in the way the Republican Party and the national media operates.\u201d White House officials take exception to that narrative. \u201cFrom Day One, the President has spurred an all-systems-go effort to take on the climate crisis \u2013 one that harnesses an all-of-government approach,\u201d Ali Zaidi, deputy White House national climate adviser, told CNN. He pointed to the administration\u2019s climate-related successes such as phasing out super-pollutants, turbo-charging offshore wind development in federal waters, tightening fuel mileage standards and enacting funding for a nationwide electric vehicle charging network. The Sunrise Movement arrived unannounced. On a November morning in 2018, days after Democrats won a sweeping House majority in the midterm elections, young activists from the group staged a sit-in in once and future House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office on Capitol Hill. They had a simple demand: \u201cBack the Green New Deal,\u201d\u202fan ambitious agenda for reducing carbon emissions over a decade and recreating the American economy and social safety net in the process. Fifty-one people were arrested by the time Pelosi\u2019s office was cleared and the group\u2019s specific request, to resurrect a select committee on climate change, had been mostly brushed aside. (A lesser version of what Sunrise envisioned was eventually formed.) But over the next two years, the organization would emerge as the preeminent force in American climate activism, a siloed and often incoherent movement that had for decades operated on the fringes of official Washington. Within days of the sit-in, the Green New Deal became a rallying cry for a new generation of progressive activists, who saw it as the only viable off-ramp on the road to further climate disaster. Early in 2019, freshman Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York \u2013 the youngest woman elected to Congress \u2013 formally introduced the Green New Deal resolution. \u201cThe goal was to create a movement that would elevate climate change to one of the top three to five issues in our country,\u201d Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ed Markey, who introduced the resolution in the Senate, told CNN. Facing a climate crisis, these youth activists stay focused on solutions Support for the program quickly became a litmus test for ambitious Democrats in the runup to the 2020 presidential election \u2013 as the party\u2019s progressive grassroots sought to reassert itself after Donald Trump\u2019s election and, in a broader scope, after a decade of deference to more cautious and technocratic-minded party leaders. The stage was set and Sunrise, a group McKibben described to CNN as \u201cthe best combination of far-reaching, idealistic and politically pragmatic that I\u2019ve almost ever seen,\u201d nailed their lines. Aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Sunrise and its allies successfully set the bar for climate policy in a field that would eventually swell to more than 20 candidates. When a climate adviser to Biden suggested to Reuters in a May 2019 interview that carving out a \u201cmiddle ground\u201d on climate was the only feasible policy-making route, the movement swarmed. At a Sanders rally at Howard University in Washington, Ocasio-Cortez declared, \u201cI will be damned if the same politicians who refused to act are going to try to come back today and say we need a middle-of-the-road approach to save our lives.\u201d The remark, which set off chants of \u201cNo middle ground\u201d inside the packed hall, prompted Biden into a defense of his record. A spokesman for Sunrise at the time offered a more measured appraisal: \u201cWe\u2019re nervous about where (Biden) stands \u2026 but there\u2019s time for him to do the right thing.\u201d Eleven months later, the moment arrived. All but defeated after Biden scored a decisive victory in the South Carolina primary before cleaning up on Super Tuesday and consolidating support from the primary field, Sanders dropped out of the race. Biden, whose climate platform Sunrise graded as \u201cF-\u201d early in the primary, would be the Democratic standard-bearer in the campaign to unseat Trump and, if he succeeded, the chief agenda-setter in Washington. Biden was a willing listener on climate, David Kieve, a top campaign climate adviser, told CNN. Clean energy investment was of personal interest to the former vice president \u2013 who had managed the 2009 Obama stimulus package and seen how its investments spurred renewables development in the US. Biden wanted to find a way to marry climate action with a message on delivering middle-class union jobs, according to Kieve. \u201cHe also understood that if we were going to turn a corner and sell climate to the American people in a way we never have before, we needed to be really explicit in connecting it to the jobs piece,\u201d said Kieve, who later served as director of public engagement at the Council on Environmental Quality in the Biden White House and is now president of climate advocacy group EDF Action. \u201cLabor was treated as a partner rather than an interest group.\u201d The Biden campaign, sensing a need to engage and energize young progressives, forged an alliance with Sanders and his allies. Most notably, they formed task forces designed to close the gap on a number of issues on which the candidates had clashed. Climate, ultimately, produced the most coherent set of goals and fostered a sense of partnership between Democrats\u2019 establishment and progressive wings. After Biden won the presidency, Democratic lawmakers moved swiftly to pass the American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus package. The legislation included billions for public transit, a win for climate advocates, but the real test lay ahead \u2013 and the memory of false dawns from more than a decade ago sharpened the minds of veteran Democratic lawmakers. Biden touts one-year anniversary of American Rescue Plan in Philadelphia Markey told CNN that the last major Democratic push on climate, a 2010 cap-and-trade bill that bore his name, failed in part because \u201cwe did not have a movement outside to ensure it would get passed through the Senate.\u201d Markey still believes the movement around the Green New Deal is the missing piece. Recent history has shown it is more complex. The barriers imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, leading activists told CNN, have blunted the movement\u2019s energy and taken many of its most passionate supporters off the streets. Now, the legislative path forward, if one exists, sits largely in the hands of Manchin and Sinema and a possible resurrection of Build Back Better. Or, as it\u2019s now called: \u201cBuilding a Better America,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said\u202fearlier this month. \u201cNo one cares about the name in the American public,\u201d Psaki said. \u201cThey care about what\u2019s in it and what it\u2019s going to do. And so that\u2019s what we\u2019re most focused on.\u201d Increasing public and governmental attention, however, on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and domestic\u202finflation at home, has pushed climate legislation to a tenuous position in Congress. And outside efforts to squeeze financial institutions out of the fossil fuel industry and encourage divestment \u2013 a direction some in the movement have pivoted toward \u2013 are complicated by worries of an energy crisis tied to the European conflict. On the legislative front, Manchin appears to be nudging along a process he previously halted. Climate is one of the few things in Biden\u2019s agenda that has survived Manchin\u2019s red pen. The West Virginian outlined a potential deal to CNN that could include allowing the government to negotiate prescription drug prices and raising taxes on the rich and corporations. The new revenue, he said, could be directed to climate investment. For now, though, it\u2019s just scattered discussions and sound bites. Conversations on a path forward are happening among Senate committee chairs, but, even with Manchin\u2019s latest gesture, a cohesive framework for a new bill remains far off.\u202fAnd Manchin, in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has pushed for boosting fossil fuel production and infrastructure immediately. There's new momentum in Congress for a climate bill, but a lot of questions on what it could include With the clock ticking until 2022 midterm campaigning picks up in earnest this summer, climate groups are feeling anxious. \u201cWhere we are right now as a climate movement is feeling pretty panicked, I would say,\u201d Christy Goldfuss, senior vice president for energy and environment policy at the Center for American Progress, told CNN recently. Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee, who campaigned for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on a climate platform, said Congress and the administration cannot wait too long and suggested passing the Build Back Better climate provisions as a standalone package. \u201cI would certainly defend, embrace, even advocate for getting that done tomorrow,\u201d Inslee told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019d be wonderful to get these other things done as well, but if it means you\u2019re waiting till next September to think you\u2019re going to get climate through two weeks before the election \u2026 I am very concerned that that is not going to be a successful strategy.\u201d The White House maintains it is continuing to push every lever it can \u2013 both on the legislative side and with executive action and federal regulation to meet Biden\u2019s emissions target and spur job creation. A White House official, while acknowledging that climate advocates\u2019 role is to continue to push for more, emphasized that the White House climate office is pushing a lot of smaller policy changes across the administration \u2013 infusing them with environmental justice and climate considerations. And even if full climate investments of Build Back Better are passed, that would only be the beginning, some Democrats say. \u201cWe have to get as much done as we can get every year,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN, \u201cand whether it was a good year or a bad year realize we\u2019re nowhere near where we need to go yet.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden has maintained impressive unity among Western allies in leading the strong coordinated response to Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s aggression in Ukraine. At home, Biden has gratified Democratic campaign strategists lately with tactical adjustments. He smacked away the far left\u2019s counterproductive \u201cdefund the police\u201d slogan in his State of the Union address. He has more aggressively promoted accomplishments like the bipartisan infrastructure bill. Last week, he slapped a \u201cPutin\u2019s price hike\u201d label on the rising cost of gasoline. And what will it get him politically in midterm elections for Congress this fall? Probably not much. Polls on the battle for Congress show a close race among registered voters, but a Republican advantage among those most enthusiastic about the election. A Wall Street Journal survey last week showed Democrats losing ground on important issues such as education, the coronavirus pandemic and protecting the middle class. The President\u2019s job approval rating \u2013 the most important indicator of November prospects \u2013 has been stuck in the low 40s for months. If it remains there on Election Day, Republicans stand a very strong chance of regaining control of Congress and roadblocking Biden\u2019s agenda. This partly reflects history\u2019s metronomic rhythms. As Democratic predecessors Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both discovered, presidents become the focus of public discontent after taking office. In their first midterm elections, they nearly always lose ground in Congress and often see their parties tossed from control. The peculiar circumstances of 2022 could exaggerate those rhythms. A robust economic recovery \u2013 something presidents always crave \u2013 has generated the nasty side effect of higher inflation as supply struggles to match demand following the pandemic shutdowns of 2020. Last year\u2019s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which fueled that recovery, also fueled inflation-producing consumer demand. Rising prices have replaced jobs as the top economic concern among voters. The White House began the year with hope for better fortunes. Light at the end of the pandemic tunnel held the promise of a brighter mood. It also underpinned economists\u2019 forecasts of diminishing inflation as the election approached. Now fresh challenges have emerged. A war initiated by a leading oil producer, and the sanctions response Biden has led, has kept the price of gas rising past $4 per gallon. That\u2019s no record. Adjusted for inflation and auto fuel-efficiency gains, Democratic economist Larry Summers told CNN last week, the burden of gas prices on consumers remains lower than 10 years ago. But any sharp increase makes motorists unhappy. The fallout could get worse. If the price for a barrel of oil \u2013 which hit $130 a week ago \u2013 were to reach and remain at $150 through mid-2021, economic recovery could turn into recession, projects Moody\u2019s economist Mark Zandi. Some Biden advisers, though not all of them, still see solid opportunities for political recovery this fall. The transition from disruptive pandemic to manageable endemic has arrived. Biden\u2019s State of the Union coupled notes of bipartisan unity around Ukraine with appeals to core Democratic constituencies he needs to energize. The White House expects his Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2013 who Republicans concede is headed for confirmation \u2013 to galvanize Black support this fall. More important is the dramatic shift in public attention to the war. Instead of wheedling Sen. Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who sank Biden\u2019s Build Back Better bill in December, the President is confronting Russia\u2019s murderous tyrant. Praise for his leadership from voices in both parties helps offset accusations of weakness and incompetence that stuck to Biden after last year\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. \u201cBiden\u2019s muscular reaffirmation of the U.S. commitment to NATO was crucial not just for Europe but for the world,\u201d conservative columnist Mona Charen, a former White House aide to Ronald Reagan, wrote last week in The Bulwark. \u201cIf Ronald Reagan were still alive, he\u2019d find little to criticize in the administration\u2019s approach.\u201d The crisis also affects intra-Republican politics. Former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s statement that the GOP can\u2019t accommodate \u201capologists for Putin\u201d squarely targeted former President Donald Trump, whose cozy relations with Russia suddenly offer Democrats a much larger target. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of potential for the focus on foreign policy to scramble things up,\u201d observed Democratic data analyst David Shor. If Biden\u2019s job approval could reach even 45% by this fall, Shor estimated, his party will have a chance to keep control of Congress. CNN\u2019s average of major polls last week showed Biden at 43% approval. That\u2019s 2 points below Shor\u2019s minimum target, but 2 points higher than the previous average in February. But the duration of any uptick remains unproven. So is the prospect that it will continue. There appears to be no possibility of a dramatic surge in support of the kind that both Presidents Bush received after the first Gulf War and the 9/11 attacks. That\u2019s due partly to increased partisan polarization, and partly to the ugly contours of a Russian invasion that the US and NATO remain determined not to engage with their own military forces. Biden\u2019s \u201cstroke has gotten stronger (but) he\u2019s still swimming against the tide,\u201d concluded Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. There are times when presidential leadership has to be its own reward.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden will deliver his first State of the Union address on Tuesday. The speech will come at a critical time for his presidency as he deals with nominating a new Supreme Court justice, managing a shaky economy and trying to prevent further Russian aggression in Ukraine. Tuesday is also the Texas primary, the first election of the 2022 midterm campaign. The speech will inevitably be tied to this fall\u2019s elections as Democrats try to maintain control of Congress despite Biden\u2019s low approval numbers. The stakes are high and the State of the Union speech is one of a president\u2019s best opportunities to clarify their vision, tout achievements and boost both the nation\u2019s morale and their own approval ratings. Presidents and first ladies typically invite about two dozen guests to sit in the House gallery to promote their priorities and values. State of the Union guests help put a human face on a president\u2019s message for both policymakers and viewers at home. Presidents often mention some guests by name in their State of the Union speech to highlight policy goals or achievements. Acknowledging guests like this is a tradition that goes back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1982 address, according to the University of California-Santa Barbara\u2019s American Presidency Project. Presidents have traditionally acknowledged some of their State of the Union guests during their speeches ever since. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama would usually call on a handful of guests by name \u2014 if they mentioned them at all. But if a shout-out from Bush or Obama was the exception, with Donald Trump, it was almost always the rule. Trump invited fewer guests than both presidents overall, but he called on nearly every guest by name. Trump didn\u2019t just acknowledge his guests to prove a point, he used them to create made-for-reality-TV moments as well; During his 2020 address, he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to radio personality Rush Limbaugh. On the same night, Trump surprised Amy Williams and her two young children by reuniting them with their husband and father, Army Sgt. 1st Class Townsend Williams, after his fourth deployment in the Middle East. Active and veteran members of the military and their families have been a staple of every recent president\u2019s State of the Union guest list, according to a CNN review of White House archives. Most of the 44 active or veteran service members that former President George W. Bush invited were involved with the wars in Afghanistan or Iraq. His administration initiated both wars and they were a critical focus of his presidency. In 2005, for instance, Bush both invited and acknowledged Bill and Janet Norwood, the parents of Marine Sgt. Byron Norwood, who was killed during the assault on Fallujah in Iraq the previous year. Military or veteran guests represented nearly one third of all the guests former president Donald Trump invited over the course of his three SOTU addresses. The White House biographies written for each guest suggest Trump was interested in promoting an agenda of American exceptionalism and not necessarily connected to current events. He was the only president of Biden\u2019s three predecessors to include World War II veterans, for example, and invited more WWII veterans than he did active or veteran members of the Iraq or Afghanistan wars. One guest at his 2019 speech, Army Staff Sgt. Irving Locker, landed at Utah Beach on D-Day, fought through five major battles and helped liberate a concentration camp. More than a fifth of Obama\u2019s guests were invited to help illustrate economic issues and helped him highlight the measures his administration took to lift the country out of the Great Recession. In 2014, Obama invited Andra Rush, who trained employees for her Detroit business through the Obama administration\u2019s American Jobs Center network. Obama prioritized inviting guests from the world of science and STEM education. He invited 14 guests from scientific backgrounds \u2013 by far the most of Biden\u2019s three predecessors. In 2014, he invited Joey Hudy, a 14-year-old self-described \u201cmaker\u201d who developed an \u201cextreme marshmallow cannon.\u201d Obama also invited two winners of the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. One of those guests was then-16-year-old Jack Andraka in 2013, who won for developing a new method of detecting pancreatic cancer. Bush featured guests from the world of arts and culture. In 2003, he invited David McCullough, the 2002 Pulitzer Prize-winning author of \u201cJohn Adams.\u201d In 2008, one of his guests was Irvin Mayfield, a legendary jazz trumpeter and appointed cultural ambassador of New Orleans.

            "article_content": "On Tuesday, San Francisco voters recalled three members of the city\u2019s school board, CNN projected, a result that many national figures \u2013 especially on the Republican side \u2013 seized on as a sign of things to come this fall. But how much were the school board elections really about national issues \u2013 like Covid-19 mitigation practices and so-called \u201cwoke\u201d culture? I put that question \u2013 and a few others \u2013  to San Francisco Chronicle senior political writer Joe Garofoli. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: How surprising were Tuesday\u2019s results? Why or why not? Garofoli: The results weren\u2019t surprising, but the size of the blowout was. How rare is it to get 79% support for anything \u2013 which is the percentage of voters who voted to recall school board member Alison Collins. (The other two members were ousted by 72% and 75% of voters.) You can\u2019t even get that level of support for ice cream. The caveat here: This was a very low turnout special election (about 26% at this point) in the middle of February. It is the kind of setting that is going to be most attractive to voters who are ticked off and passionate. Plus, the recall opponents were vastly outspent. Cillizza: How did these recall measures make the ballot? Garofoli: Given that we just had a high-profile gubernatorial recall election here in California, you might think that these things happen all the time in San Francisco. Actually, they are rare. How rare? The last one to make the ballot was in 1983 against then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein. (She defeated it.) To get on the ballot, the recall organizers needed to gather 51,325 valid signatures supporting the recall for each board member it wanted to toss, or 10% of registered voters. Supporters collected about 80,000 for each. Cillizza: Were these races targeted by national types? Or was it more local? Garofoli: The school board recall was driven by local grassroots activism, with a particularly strong showing by San Francisco\u2019s Asian American community. That said, there was an outsized amount of money raised \u2013 nearly $2 million \u2013 in favor of the recall. That\u2019s crazy money for a school board race, even in San Francisco, where everything is overpriced. One of the largest donors was tech billionaire Arthur Rock, a charter school proponent. The recall opponents raised about $86,000, which explains their paltry defense. But any attempts to characterize this as a GOP-driven recall \u2013 like the failed recall of Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s was last year \u2013 are misguided. Just ask one recall organizer, who, as my colleague Heather Knight noted, \u201cdressed up in a yellow T-shirt \u2014 plus a rainbow beard, top hat, silver pants and platform boots. I\u2019m Gaybraham Lincoln. Queens for the recall!\u2026. Do I look like a Republican? Hello!\u201d (OK, so technically the real Abe Lincoln was a Republican. Save your cards and letters.) Grassroots organizers \u2013 the people in the neighborhoods doing the heavy lifting on this campaign \u2013 were adamant that they wanted to save their local public schools. And no, they were not Republicans. Cillizza: National political operatives are casting these recalls as the latest sign of voter anger about Covid-19 restrictions in school. Is that a fair characterization? Garofoli: Yes, San Francisco public school parents \u2013 like many parents around the country \u2013 were frustrated about the long delays to get back to class. But this frustration was compounded by only-in-San Francisco issues, starting with the board\u2019s decision to rename 44 school sites that had names they found objectionable or racist or offensive in some way (a list that included schools named Lincoln, Washington and Dianne Feinstein). Parents thought the board was spending too much time on that instead of trying to get kids back in class safely. Parents, particularly in the Asian American community, also objected to the board removing merit-based admissions for Lowell High School, one of the city\u2019s top public schools. On top of that, the school district is running a massive budget deficit and needs to hire a new superintendent. Yet many conservatives are trying to twist this into something it isn\u2019t. After The Chronicle called the election Tuesday night, I was retweeted by a conservative commentator who coupled the recall with Glenn Youngkin\u2019s victory in Virginia. \u201cGOP and pro-parent candidates are going to roll. Dems\u2019 platform not attractive: Inflation at Home; Appeasement Abroad; Teachers\u2019 Unions First;  Wide Open Boarder; Protect Big Tech; Raise Taxes; Regulate Everything.\u201d Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let\u2019s tap the brakes, there. This is NOT all that. This is one, locally-driven school board race in San Francisco, where about three of every four voters is a Democrat and the rest are in hiding. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cThe big takeaway from Tuesday\u2019s election is __________.\u201d Now, explain. Garofoli: \u201c\u2026 San Francisco remains a great news town.\u201d Need I say more?",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden entered office promising to end the Covid-19 pandemic, boost a lagging economy, get Americans back to work, restore US credibility abroad and heal a divided nation. After one year, the reviews from the American people in public polling on those topics, in many cases, have not been kind. Biden won\u2019t face the voters again until 2024, the ultimate judgment on what the American people think of the job he\u2019s done in office. But to get a benchmark on how Americans are feeling on the issues closest to them, CNN analyzed recent polling in subject areas that were the most important to Americans in January 2021, when Biden took office. The President has faced a variety of unique public health, diplomatic and economic obstacles. He\u2019s also claimed victories, including a drop in the unemployment rate, ramped up Covid-19 vaccinations and the passage of two major legislative priorities. But while the administration has boasted of all they\u2019ve done to improve the country over the last year, public perception hasn\u2019t followed suit. Just 41% of Americans approve of the way Biden\u2019s handling his job while 54% disapprove, according to the latest CNN Poll of Polls. On Wednesday, Biden acknowledged the need to reach out to Americans ahead of the midterm elections in November, vowing to spend year two speaking with the public and making the case for \u201cwhat we\u2019ve already done, why it\u2019s important, and \u2026 what will happen if they support what else I want to do.\u201d In his first year in office, Biden took a number of steps intended to bolster the economy and create jobs, including the signing of the American Rescue Plan and the bipartisan infrastructure law. But as the pandemic has dragged on into its third calendar year, the President has faced challenges trying to ameliorate supply chain issues and inflation, labor shortages and volatile stocks have affected American consumers. A December 2021 CNN/SSRS poll shows Biden comes into his second year with a 44% approval rating to 55% disapproval rating among registered voters on his economic performance. This makes for a -9 point net approval rating. The average of all polls taken in December is quite similar with Biden at -13 points on the economy. The average president at that point in the last 44 years (since we have been polling on the topic) had a net economic approval rating of +5 points. That means Biden\u2019s is 18 points worse than the average. In a December NPR/Marist poll, most who received either stimulus payments or who received the expanded child tax credit that began last summer said those payments helped just a little or not at all. A December CNN survey found 54% said they disapproved of the job Biden was doing helping the middle class. The pandemic\u2019s public health and economic challenges dominated Biden\u2019s first-year agenda. The Biden administration undertook a number of major efforts to address Covid-19, such as ramping up vaccine manufacturing and distribution, purchasing and deploying vaccines abroad and purchasing major quantities of anti-viral treatments. But there have also been missteps. In recent months, for example, the Biden administration has taken heat for Covid-19 testing shortages that occurred when the Omicron variant led to a new wave in cases this winter. At the end of December, Biden conceded that not enough had been done to expand testing capacity. And now, as the wave appears to be on the cusp of subsiding, new efforts to distribute masks nationwide and half a billion rapid tests via mail are just rolling out. A Monmouth University poll in December found that 60% of adults feel worn out by the changes they\u2019ve had to make in their daily lives due to Covid-19, and that the share who feel Biden is doing a good job of dealing with the coronavirus has dropped to 46%, below 50% for the first time in Monmouth\u2019s polling. Biden\u2019s ratings for handling Covid-19 have generally been better than his overall approval rating. Biden entered office declaring that America was returning to the world stage by reentering global agreements, like the Paris Climate Accords, and reestablishing close ties with American allied nations. But there were challenges, including the messy US withdrawal from Afghanistan, tensions with Russia and China, as well as and a major diplomatic kerfuffle with France over nuclear submarines. According to a CBS Poll released earlier this week, 62% of adults disapproved of the way Biden is handling Afghanistan. On those tensions with Russia and China, Biden receives slightly better marks but is still under water \u2013 55% disapprove of his handling of issues with Russia and 59% disapprove of his handling of issues with China. And a Pew Research Center survey in June found that in each of the 16 foreign nations they polled, more than 6 in 10 expressed confidence in Biden to do the right thing in world affairs. Twelve nations surveyed by Pew in both 2020 and 2021 showed a median of 75% expressing confidence in Biden, compared to 17% for then-President Donald Trump in 2020. The President came into office calling for national unity, following the violent insurrection at the US Capitol by pro-Trump rioters attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Biden also spent his first year expressing the importance of compromise, using his infrastructure law as a prime example for how Republicans and Democrats can achieve major feats when they work together. But a Pew Research Center analysis from November found that political polarization among Americans remains dominant, and that Republicans and Democrats agree on very little. And even within their own parties, they face sharp divisions. The Associated Press-NORC poll released Thursday showed only 16% of US adults felt the country was much more or somewhat more united, as compared to 43% who said much more or somewhat more divided. Forty-two percent of those polled said things were neither more united or divided under Biden. Views on Biden are also sharply divided along party lines. Earlier this week, Gallup found that political party polarization in its presidential approval ratings is at its highest for any first-year president.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jon Gabriel is Editor-in-Chief of Ricochet.com and an opinion contributor to the Arizona Republic. Follow him on Twitter at @ExJon. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. Sen. John McCain may have died four years ago, but his spirit still looms over Arizona politics. That maverick attitude was still strong enough to defeat the state\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d candidates. Arizona conservatives long viewed McCain with suspicion, but there were enough centrist Republicans, Democrats and independents to keep him in office for more than three decades. This time, GOP gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake foolishly cursed his name four days before the election. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any McCain Republicans in here, do we?\u201d Lake asked from a campaign stage. \u201cAlright, get the hell out,\u201d she said, before adding, \u201cBoy, Arizona has delivered some losers, haven\u2019t they?\u201d While Democrats may have bucked the national trend, Republicans still hold a large sway in GOP-led states Anyone who\u2019s read classical literature knows that hubris invites Nemesis. And Nemesis showed up Tuesday night as media organizations called the race for Democrat Katie Hobbs. Yes, Arizona has delivered some losers. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Most polls showed Lake leading Hobbs and Republican US Senate candidate Blake Masters within the margin of error against incumbent Sen. Mark Kelly. Add to that a truly atrocious campaign by the Democrats\u2019 would-be governor, and most insiders expected a Lake victory at least. She would have won, too, if only she welcomed those McCain Republicans still scattered across the voter rolls. McCain Republicans overlap with those who crossed party lines to support President Joe Biden, turning the state blue in 2020. They tend to be centrist, business-friendly, middle- to upper-middle-class folks who live in the nicer neighborhoods of Phoenix and its close-in suburbs. They want lower taxes, efficient government and absolutely no drama. Opinion: Goodbye, Kari Lake. And good riddance to all election deniers They don\u2019t make up the majority of the party \u2013 not by a long shot \u2013 but they exceed that single percentage point Lake needed to best Hobbs. They heard Lake\u2019s call to \u201cget the hell out,\u201d and did as they were told. The numbers bear this out. Arizona State Treasurer Kimberly Yee easily won re-election by double digits despite a quality opponent. A traditional Republican, Yee focused on fiscal responsibility instead of Trump-era grievances. As the count stands now, Yee outperformed Lake by about 118,000 votes. In other words, voters intentionally split their ticket to shun the MAGA candidate. A similar dynamic played out with Arizona\u2019s Congressional candidates. The GOP flipped two seats and will now send a Republican majority to Capitol Hill. In the State Legislature, the GOP is expected to hold onto their one-seat majority in both chambers. Overall, the midterms turned out quite well for Arizona Republicans, as long as the candidates focused on traditional issues. Katie Hobbs will win Arizona governor's race, CNN projects, defeating Trump favorite Kari Lake Senate candidate Blake Masters was less strident on McCain but didn\u2019t prove compelling enough to beat the incumbent (and former astronaut) Sen. Mark Kelly. It didn\u2019t help that Kelly held a 7-to-1 spending advantage over the previously unknown Masters. Early ads successfully defined the newcomer in not-so-flattering \u2013 and not so accurate \u2013 ways. Politics ain\u2019t beanbag. With the Lake and Masters defeats, recriminations are flying across the Grand Canyon State. Some blame Trump and the \u201cstop the steal\u201d conspiracies that have lingered for the past two years. Others insist establishment Republicans should have invested millions more into the ill-fated campaigns. The infighting is nothing new for the Arizona GOP, which has endured bruising battles for years. During the Obama years, it was Tea Party activists vs. the \u201cMcCain machine,\u201d with the latter winning every big contest. The Tea Partiers later morphed into MAGA voters, still bristling at the veteran senator holding sway over the party. Following McCain\u2019s death from a brain tumor in 2018, the grassroots seized party leadership and began to punish their old rivals. Fealty to Trump was demanded of all GOP candidates, high or low. And when the 2020 conspiracy theories kicked in, the devotion had to be expressed even more fervently \u2014 or else.  The result? Mainstream Republican candidates lost their primaries or simply decided not to run. This ultimately led to a Democratic governor and the re-election of a Democratic Senator. Right-of-center Arizonans wonder how the party will move forward. Allegations of stolen elections are already being floated, but they will be hard to sell considering the many GOP victories in Congressional and down-ballot races. Also, most Republicans now understand that such paranoia leads to embarrassment at the ballot box. As the party looks toward ousting Democratic Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and Biden in two years, the state party better mend fences with the ghost of McCain. Perhaps 2024 candidates can start their speeches with, \u201cDo we have some McCain Republicans in here? Alright, come on in.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Meg Jacobs teaches history at Princeton University. Follow her on Twitter @MegJacobs100. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Read more opinion on CNN. President Joe Biden stands accused of playing politics with petroleum. His opponents say the reason he is releasing millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is to bring prices at the pump down before the midterm elections. They might be right. As public opinion polls reveal, the economy appears to be the top issue for voters. As we approach the midterms, more and more candidates, especially in the GOP, are running on anti-inflation platforms. It\u2019s nothing new. That\u2019s because battles over inflation \u2014 what\u2019s the cause, who is to blame, what is there to do \u2014 get to basic fights over who should have what. Should corporations earn bigger profits, should workers earn higher wages and should consumers shoulder the burden of both? The Federal Reserve is responding to the highest rate of inflation in 40 years, and economists are debating whether the Fed should keep raising rates or pause, trying to find the sweet spot and guide the economy toward a soft landing. But there is a disconnect between debates over policy and the political dogfights over high prices. The public, and its representatives, are having a very different discussion. They see this economic phenomenon as a competition over who deserves what. The GOP political action committee One Nation has spent millions in Georgia to unseat Sen. Raphael Warnock, saying he has supported \u201creckless spending,\u201d which it blames for recent inflation. Warnock and other Democrats argued in favor of the economic rescue package as needed to help people cope with the pandemic, but as The New York Times reported, they\u2019re wary of trumpeting that spending now as the GOP blames it for inflation. That, too, is nothing new. In 1952, Dwight D. Eisenhower, the decorated World War II general and GOP presidential candidate, aired the first televised political ad. The theme was inflation. Is the high cost of living getting you down? In the ad, he talks to an \u201caverage\u201d housewife, who complains that \u201chigh prices are just driving me crazy,\u201d and Eisenhower promises to fight on her behalf. That was at a time when inflation was less than 2%! Joe Biden's Corvette challenge This strategy was a way of blaming organized labor \u2014 which in turn was a way of blaming the New Deal. In many spots, Eisenhower looked in the camera and said, \u201cInstead of asking which party will bring prices down, why not ask which party has put prices up?\u201d And then he broke a piece of wood in half to demonstrate the decrease in purchasing power since the end of World War II. The campaign was largely successful. According to the GOP, organized labor was benefiting at the expense of middle-class consumers. And there was something to it. This was the moment when for the first time the US census declared salaried, largely nonunion, white-collar workers outnumbered blue-collar industrial workers. Both groups prospered, but blue-collar union men and women were closing the wage gap with those who worked in offices. That meant that all sorts of semiskilled factory workers, of different races and ethnicities, were catching up to their better-educated White counterparts. Organized labor was at its peak of power, and unions even succeeded in getting cost-of-living adjustment clauses written into their contracts, a benefit that those who received an annual salary and were not a party to collective bargaining agreements did not have. Americans are exhausted from dealing with inflation. 7 experts offer ideas for helping them cope The Republicans, now in power, used \u201ccreeping inflation\u201d to undercut labor\u2019s newfound power. \u201cInflation is the great thief,\u201d warned George Humphrey, Eisenhower\u2019s first Treasury secretary. \u201cThe young, the old, the sick, the small saver, all those least able to protect themselves are the helpless prey of wicked inflation.\u201d According to public opinion polls of the 1950s, when annual inflation averaged less than 3%, Americans cited inflation as the most important domestic problem in eight of 10 years. The Democrats tried to blame the big corporations for \u201cadministering\u201d higher prices, but that charge fell on deaf ears. Demonizing labor won out. As the liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith wrote in 1957, \u201cThe public will always attribute the whole of the price increases \u2026 to the presumed rapacity of the unions.\u201d The next big distributive battle over the high cost of living came in the 1970s. By then, though, the conversation was different. Republicans used inflation not so much to target organized labor, or only organized labor, as much as they blamed inflation on government spending for welfare programs that politicians said we could not afford. Already in the 1960s, before there was full-blown inflation, the GOP was criticizing President Lyndon B. Johnson for spending too much on his Great Society, including his War on Poverty and fair housing. The Fed is doing what it should to fight inflation That attack on Democrats as spending too much continued into the 1970s when inflation heated up. In the early days of the energy crisis, there was a push, for example, to cut busing for school integration as a luxury that required more fuel and only drove up the price of gas. Richard Nixon, then in the Oval Office, slapped price controls on everything from beef to gas, fearing the impact on his reelection efforts. And after the Arab embargo in the fall of 1973, he knew that rising prices at the pump was a \u201cgut issue\u201d that could bring him down. Despite his GOP free-market roots, he embraced price controls. Nixon was under pressure from Democrats who blamed prices at the pump on Big Oil and hauled leading oil executives before televised congressional hearings and accused them of earning \u201cobscene profits.\u201d These attacks played well \u200bin the lead-up to  the midterm elections of 1974 when Democrats expanded their control. Yes, there was the Watergate scandal. But polls showed that what people really cared about was the high cost of living.  \u200bA Gallup Poll that July found 48% of those surveyed reported the high cost of living as the paramount problem; only 11% pointed to corruption in government and Watergate. A generation of scholars and textbooks barely mentions this aspect of the 1974 midterms. Watergate seemed so much more pressing. But even today, as then, it is not clear that allegations of wrongdoing by a current or former President matter as much as rising prices. I retired during the pandemic. Now inflation has me counting pennies You would think that the 1976 election would have been a clear victory for Jimmy Carter after Nixon\u2019s resignation and President Gerald Ford\u2019s pardon of the disgraced President. But it wasn\u2019t. It was a close race, with Carter winning by less than 2% of the popular vote, because by then the first oil shock was over or had at least stabilized. But high prices would come to define Carter\u2019s presidency. Commentators are constantly reminding us that now is the worse inflation since the 1970s. But the 1970s were defined by stagflation, not just inflation, where rising prices were, to the surprise of the professional economists, accompanied by rising unemployment. That made the impact of inflation even worse. And that made Carter\u2019s reelection chances in 1980, when inflation ran at double digits, pretty grim. Most politicians in his party wanted him to fight unemployment. In the end, he opted for combatting inflation. And he ushered in what became known as the \u201cVolcker shock,\u201d appointing Paul Volcker to the Fed. Volcker pushed interest rates even higher than the rate of inflation. No one at the time was talking about trying to find a soft landing. Unemployment shot up. Even if interest rate hikes promised to wipe out inflation, the public didn\u2019t care, and Carter paid the price, losing in a landslide to Ronald Reagan. Today, few candidates are running on a debate over what the Fed should or shouldn\u2019t do. Since the Volcker shock, economists have established interest rate hikes as the proper policy response.  But Americans continue to fight over who is to blame for inflation. Is it Big Oil, is it Vladimir Putin\u2019s price hike? Or is it Biden and the increase in government spending on his watch? Certainly, it helps Democrats that gas prices, a huge driver of inflation, have come down. Nothing puts people on edge as much as rising gas prices. And the newly announced release from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a recognition of that reality. But it remains unclear how the high cost of living is going to play out at the ballot box. The one thing that is clear is that these fights are just as much about who deserves what as they are about actual policy.",

In an emotional address to the UN Security Council yesterday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Russian troops of killing civilians for \u201cpleasure\u201d and warned more atrocities could occur. Zelensky\u2019s speech came a day after he visited the Kyiv suburb of Bucha, where shocking images of bodies in the streets emerged over the weekend. Separately, the top US military officer told lawmakers yesterday that the world is becoming more unstable and the \u201cpotential for significant international conflict is increasing, not decreasing.\u201d Later today, the US will announce new sanctions on Russia in coordination with several other nations and the European Union, according to an administration official. More than 45 million people are under an enhanced severe weather threat across the Southeast US this morning, where a powerful storm could deliver a triple threat of wind, tornadoes and flooding. Parts of Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee and the western Carolinas could see damaging winds and a few tornadoes in the coming days, according to the latest forecasts. A flood watch is also in effect for about 2 million people in the region, with some isolated areas getting around 5 inches of rain. The storm system is hitting the region at an unfortunate time, as most areas remain in recovery mode from recent\u00a0 tornadoes and treacherous thunderstorms. At least two people were killed yesterday by the storms, local officials said. The Oklahoma legislature yesterday passed a near-total ban on abortion, making exceptions only in the case of medical emergencies. The bill would make performing an abortion or attempting to perform the procedure a felony punishable by a maximum fine of $100,000 or a maximum of 10 years in state prison, or both. The legislation passed the state Republican-led House by a 70-14 vote, without debate or questions on the floor. The bill now heads to Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt, who previously promised to sign every bill limiting abortion that came across his desk. This comes as several state legislatures have advanced bills restricting abortion access. Last week, Arizona\u2019s Republican governor signed into law a ban on abortions after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for cases of rape and incest.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in The Point newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. In the final stretch of the midterm elections, President Joe Biden repeatedly blasted Republicans on the issues of Social Security and Medicare. In a speech delivered in Florida just one week out from the Election Day, Biden said this: \u201cThey\u2019re coming after your Social Security and Medicare in a big way. Folks here in Florida, you need to know this. \u2026 Because if your own senator \u2013 Sen. Rick Scott \u2013 I have the brochure here he has. \u201cHe\u2019s in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate. He\u2019s the head of the campaign. And he laid out a clear plan. He said every five years, Social Security and Medicare would have to be reauthorized.\u201d And now, Scott, who chaired the National Republican Senatorial Committee this cycle, is fighting back, trying to make sure that the history written around the 2022 elections doesn\u2019t put the blame for his party\u2019s failure to take control of the Senate\u00a0directly on him. In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner headlined, \u201cWashington liars will not stop us from rescuing America,\u201d Scott goes at not just Biden, but leaders in the Republican Party (cough, Mitch McConnell, cough) who criticized him for offering a detailed plan for what the GOP would do if they won the Senate majority. Scott argued that while Republicans were effective in criticizing Democrats, they failed to communicate how they would\u00a0solve the country\u2019s problems. Here\u2019s Scott: \u201cAnd the stunning part is that this is on purpose. That is the current strategy of many Republicans in Washington, to be against the crazy Democrats only and never outline any plans of what we are for or what we will do. \u201cAnd if you dare step out of line and suggest that we give people something to vote for, they attack you, and they partner with the Democrats to twist your words and trash you and tell you to be quiet.\u201d That critique is aimed directly at McConnell, who easily beat back a challenge from Scott earlier this month to retain his job as Senate minority leader. McConnell was openly dismissive of Scott\u2019s policy plan when the Florida senator initially released it. \u201cLet me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda,\u201d McConnell said in March. \u201cWe will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.\u201d Among the many things Scott proposed in his plan to \u201crescue America\u201d is that all federal legislation \u2013 including government programs like Social Security and Medicare \u2013 would sunset after five years unless Congress specifically re-approved it. Scott\u2019s op-ed is rightly seen as the latest strike in the not-so-cold war between himself and McConnell. Scott has national ambitions \u2013 his quixotic challenge to McConnell makes that point clearly enough \u2013 and knows that he is being blamed in some GOP circles for handing Biden and Democrats a campaign issue with his policy plan. In case you missed that point, Scott makes it himself. \u201cMy effort to change the way the Senate operates is not over,\u201d he pledges in his op-ed, adding: \u201cThe old Washington establishment Republican path of never having a vision is over, it\u2019s dying. A new wave of bold and aggressive Republicans who will stand up and fight is demanding change from our leaders in Washington.\u201d The Point: Scott isn\u2019t about to let himself be the scapegoat for the 2022 election. And he\u2019s coming out swinging.",

            "article_content": "Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell won a secret-ballot leadership election after days of finger-pointing over the Republican midterm losses, putting him on pace to become the longest-serving Senate party leader in US history. McConnell defeated Florida Sen. Rick Scott, his first challenger in his 15 years atop his conference. McConnell won the leadership vote 37-10-1 and said at a news conference that he was \u201cpretty proud\u201d of the result. \u201cI don\u2019t own this job. Anybody who wants to run for it can feel free to do so,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cI\u2019m not in any way offended by having an opponent or having a few votes in opposition.\u201d Asked whether the challenge to his leadership made him more or less likely he\u2019ll step aside after next year, when he will beat the record of longest-serving Senate party leader, McConnell said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\u201d Senate Republican Conference chairman Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming formally announced the slate of GOP leadership positions following the elections, including that Republican Sen. John Thune would continue as whip. Montana Sen. Steve Daines will replace Scott as the chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm. Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst will become the next policy chair, replacing Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, who\u2019s retiring at the end of his term. West Virginia\u2019s Shelley Moore Capito will become the GOP conference\u2019s vice chairwoman. The fight for Senate GOP leader underscored the discontent brewing among Republican senators, who failed to win back the majority despite a favorable national political environment. \u201cI voted for change,\u201d said South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, who voted for Scott. \u201cI accept the results of the conference, and I hope we can be better.\u201d The Florida Republican said in a statement that he would press on. \u201cAlthough the results of today\u2019s elections weren\u2019t what we hoped for, this is far from the end of our fight to Make Washington Work,\u201d Scott said. Several Republican senators emerged from the meeting saying the open dialogue was cathartic. \u201cThat was the best conversation we\u2019ve had as a Senate group since I\u2019ve been here,\u201d said Indiana Republican Sen. Mike Braun, who supported Scott over McConnell. \u201cIt was interactive. It fleshed out what we\u2019re going to be for as a caucus.\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of the GOP leadership team, said he understands some of the frustrations that members feel about the Senate process, which he said is not as inclusive as it used to be. \u201cI think there is an appetite for better communication and more collaboration and more input,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t get elected to the United States Senate to be shutout of the discussion and that\u2019s essentially what\u2019s happened when the bills are written in the leader\u2019s conference. Braun and Cornyn were tasked with counting the secret ballots. Cornyn quipped they had \u201cto make sure there wasn\u2019t any mischief.\u201d Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley said the long meeting had \u201clower intensity\u201d than another on Tuesday, joking it was someone\u2019s strategy to make the room on Wednesday \u201cfreezing cold.\u201d After the tense, hours-long meeting on Tuesday \u2013 the first in-person get together for Republican members since their disappointing midterm elections \u2013 Scott told reporters that he planned to challenge McConnell for the top job. \u201cI\u2019m running for leader,\u201d the Florida Republican told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not satisfied with the status quo and so I think we ought to have an option.\u201d Throughout this year, Scott and McConnell have had a long-simmering conflict over messaging, outlook and how to spend resources this election cycle. The two have disagreed over the quality of their candidates, whether to engage in GOP primaries, whether to put forward an agenda or keep the focus on President Joe Biden, and where to compete. After losing the leadership election on Wednesday, Scott said that he would continue to advance his plan to \u201crescue America,\u201d an agenda that was criticized by McConnell and President Joe Biden, who said it would take aim at Social Security and Medicare. \u201cI will never stop fighting to finally take action to protect Social Security and Medicare and preserve the promise of these programs for our children and grandchildren,\u201d said Scott in his statement. \u201cI never thought for a moment that this fight would be easy, but I\u2019m optimistic that, together, Republicans can rescue America with the principles that unite us against the dangerous path Democrats have set it on.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s vote comes after Scott, as well as a handful of conservative senators, called for a delay in the leadership elections until after the Georgia runoff, underscoring Senate Republicans\u2019 frustration with the outcome of the 2022 elections. That effort to push back the vote failed during the closed-door meeting, though 16 GOP senators voted to delay the GOP leadership elections, according to a source familiar. And while Scott had little chance of succeeding in his bid to be leader, his declaration was seen as a protest vote. Asked by CNN why McConnell won, Hawley, who voted for Scott, turned sarcastic. \u201cBecause the conference doesn\u2019t want to change course,\u201d Hawley responded. \u201cThey want to do what we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s working so well.\u201d During the closed-door meeting with his Republican colleagues on Tuesday, Scott engaged in a tense back-and-forth with McConnell. \u201cSen. Scott disagrees with the approach that Mitch has taken in this election and for the last couple of years, and he made that clear and Sen. McConnell criticized Sen. Scott\u2019s management of the NRSC,\u201d Hawley told reporters about the exchange. Meanwhile, Cornyn said after emerging from the closed door meeting on Tuesday he was eager to get past the divisions with his Republican colleagues and hold the leadership elections. He said he believed Republicans\u2019 focus should be on helping Georgia Senate nominee Herschel Walker in his December 6 runoff against Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. \u201cI think the best thing we can do is get this behind us,\u201d Cornyn told CNN. \u201cBecause you guys will keep writing about it for the next three weeks and it will distract from the Georgia runoff, which I think should be our undivided focus.\u201d For Democrats, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that their caucus leadership elections will be December 8, according to a source familiar at the Senate Democrats\u2019 lunch on Wednesday.

            "article_content": "Florida Sen. Rick Scott made it official on Tuesday: He is going to run for Senate Republican leader against Mitch McConnell. Which, at first glance, may seem sort of odd. After all, Scott was the head of the Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm in the midterm elections and, well, the party didn\u2019t win control the Senate. So, sort of an odd time to ask for a promotion, right? But there is a logic behind Scott\u2019s move \u2013 even if it is almost certainly doomed. (McConnell said Tuesday that he has the votes he needs to be reelected as Senate Republican leader.) Here are three major reasons why Scott is taking on this quixotic challenge: 1) Scott wants to make McConnell squirm. Scott and McConnell have history with each other. When Scott released a policy plan \u201cto rescue America\u201d earlier this year, McConnell was openly dismissive of the proposals it contained. Asked what the Republican agenda would be, McConnell responded coyly: \u201cThat is a very good question and I\u2019ll let you know when we take [the Senate] back.\u201d Scott remained adamant that Senate Republican candidates needed to be for a set of policy proposals, not just against President Joe Biden and the Democrats. McConnell was just as convinced that by releasing a specific plan, Scott was handing Democrats a cudgel with which to smash all Republicans. It\u2019s worth noting that Biden regularly mentioned Scott\u2019s plan \u2013 which, among other, things would have sunsetted government programs like Social Security and Medicare after five years \u2013 in the final stretch of the midterms. McConnell and Scott clashed again after the Senate minority leader suggested in August that \u201ccandidate quality\u201d had the potential to hinder Republican chances of retaking the Senate majority. \u201cIf you want to trash-talk our candidates to help the Democrats, pipe down,\u201d said Scott in response. \u201cThat\u2019s not what leaders do. And Republicans need to be leaders that build up the team and do everything they can to get the entire team over the finish line.\u201d (McConnell was right: poor candidates in places like Arizona and New Hampshire clearly cost Republicans in the election.) 2) Scott wants to pass off the blame. When you are the head of the GOP\u2019s Senate campaign arm and you fall short of netting the one seat you need to win the majority, well, you are usually in line to be blamed. But Scott has been working very hard to hand that blame pie to McConnell. \u201cThe leadership in the Republican Senate says, \u2018No, you cannot have a plan. We\u2019re just going to run against how bad the Democrats are\u2019 and actually then they cave in to the Democrats,\u201d Scott said on Fox News over the weekend. This challenge to McConnell is simply an extension of that blame game. Scott wants to ensure that his voice is heard when it comes to the postmortem report of what happened in the election. He doesn\u2019t want McConnell\u2019s narrative to be the one that is accepted by Republicans inside and outside of Washington. And one way to guarantee your side gets heard is to take on the guy who you think is really to blame. 3) Scott wants to make Donald Trump happy. Scott knows he isn\u2019t going to beat McConnell in a vote of all the Republican senators. And he also knows he will earn the forever enmity of McConnell and his allies by challenging the leader.  But this move is really for an audience of one: Donald Trump. Scott has, without question, national ambition. What better way to audition for, say, the vice presidency than take on the Republican that Trump castigates nearly every day? Even in losing, Scott looks like the principled warrior for Trump \u2013 willing to stand up to the establishment forces and say \u201cno more.\u201d  The end result, which will likely be lopsided for McConnell, is almost beside the point. It\u2019s the willingness to run that will matter to Trump (or so Scott hopes).",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden warned about threats to democracy should Republicans take Congress as he returned to the campaign trail to stump for Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in what is poised to be one of his final western campaign stops of the midterms. The rally in Albuquerque, New Mexico, was aimed at boosting a key ally locked in one of the marquee gubernatorial races of the cycle. While Biden\u2019s remarks mostly focused on the economy, he repeated a message from the previous night that democracy is under attack. \u201cThey\u2019re going after your right to vote and who\u2019s going to count the vote,\u201d Biden said of Republicans, adding that \u201cdemocracy is on the ballot.\u201d   The president called out several Republicans by name \u2013 including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Florida Sen. Rick Scott \u2013 for their positions on Social Security and Medicare, calling them \u201creckless and irresponsible.\u201d \u201cFive days \u2013  five days to go until the most important election in our lifetime,\u201d Biden told the audience. \u201cSo much is changing. This is not a referendum, this is a choice \u2013 a choice between two vastly different visions for America.\u201d The president\u2019s visit underscores the high political stakes for Democrats as they look to keep as many governor\u2019s mansions in their control, in a midterm election that has largely focused on the question of whether Biden\u2019s party will be able to keep control of Congress \u2013 and if not, how much it might be able to minimize its losses. It marks the third time in as many weeks that the president has dropped into typically Democratic territory where his party\u2019s gubernatorial nominees are facing tough races. Last week, the president touted manufacturing investments in Syracuse, New York, alongside Gov. Kathy Hochul, who is in a tighter-than-expected reelection race against Republican US Rep. Lee Zeldin. Hochul will get an additional boost Thursday when she appears with Vice President Kamala Harris and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at a get-out-the-vote event in New York City. In early October, Biden made his way to Portland, Oregon, where his party\u2019s gubernatorial nominee \u2013 Tina Kotek \u2013 hopes to retain Democratic control in a close three-way fight for the governor\u2019s seat \u201cThe role of governors in America is increasing exponentially in terms of how the states function and the roles they play,\u201d Biden said at a fundraising event for Kotek. In an appearance at Central New Mexico Community College before the rally, the president discussed his administration\u2019s efforts to lower college costs and assist student borrowers, also warning of the consequences if Republican officials succeed in their plan to unravel Biden\u2019s debt relief plan. Biden\u2019s plan for student debt relief has been one of the administration\u2019s moves that Democrats hope will motivate younger voters to get to the polls before next week\u2019s midterm elections. Nearly 26 million people have submitted their information to the Department of Education to be considered for loan forgiveness, according to the White House, with 16 million applications expected to be approved by the end of the week. \u201cOur student loan program is designed to give just a little more breathing room, a little breathing room,\u201d Biden said in his Thursday remarks at the college. \u201cThis is a game changer for so many people. We\u2019re hearing from people all over the country about how easy it is to apply.\u201d However, the president\u2019s student loan forgiveness program remains tied up in the courts, creating uncertainty over when or if that relief will ultimately be extended to applicants. A federal appeals court put a temporary hold on the student loan forgiveness program last month, pausing its implementation while the court considers a challenge brought by six Republican-led states. The Biden administration has argued it should be able to carry out its policy while the appeal plays out. The administration is also facing lawsuits from Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, and conservative groups such as the Job Creators Network Foundation and the Cato Institute. Biden on Thursday brought up the predicament those 16 million applicants en route to approval face, saying that though they \u201cshould be seeing relief in the coming days,\u201d that relief is on hold \u201cbecause Republican members of the Congress (and) Republican governors are doing everything they can \u2013 including taking us to court \u2013 to deny the relief \u2026 even to their own constituents.\u201d He continued: \u201cTheir outrage is just simply wrong. And I might add, not to be too political here, but hypocritical. We are fighting them in court. We\u2019re not letting them get away with it.\u201d The president has expressed confidence his plan will be upheld by the courts, predicting student loan borrowers will begin receiving relief within weeks. Speaking about Republicans, who have argued that the plan is too costly and could make inflation worse, the president said at a campaign rally in Miami Gardens, Florida, on Monday, \u201cThey moaned and groaned about it and they challenged it in court, which they\u2019re going to lose.\u201d Biden made his latest student debt relief pitch at a community college where more than a third of students are Pell Grant recipients and more than half of students are Latino. The president also highlighted the state\u2019s Opportunity Scholarship Program, which provides tuition free college for eligible New Mexico residents. Lujan Grisham, Sen. Ben Ray Lujan and Rep. Melanie Stansbury were in attendance along with New Mexico Community College President Tracy Hartzler. The speech in New Mexico followed a similar event last month when the president traveled to Delaware State University, one of the country\u2019s historically black colleges and universities, to promote his loan forgiveness plan as officials have hoped the issue will motivate young voters heading into the midterm elections. The results of the Senate and House races next week \u2013 and whether the midterms will ultimately hand Republicans control of Congress \u2013 will be pivotal in determining what the second half of Biden\u2019s presidency will look like. With the narrowest of majorities in Congress during his first two years in office, the president has been able to enact some of his most important legislative priorities \u2013 from a sweeping infrastructure package to a major health care, tax and climate change bill signed into law just this year. Democrats openly acknowledge that without the House or the Senate in their control, legislative victories will be near-impossible to come by in the next session of Congress.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Wednesday delivered remarks from Union Station in Washington, DC, on democracy and the upcoming midterm elections. Read his speech as delivered below: Good evening, everyone. Just a few days ago a little before 2:30 a.m. in the morning, a man smashed the back window and broke into the home of the speaker of the House of Representatives, the third highest-ranking official in America. He carried in his backpack zip-ties, duct tape, rope, and a hammer. As he told the police, he had come looking for Nancy Pelosi to take her hostage, to interrogate her, to threaten to break her kneecaps. But she wasn\u2019t there. Her husband, my friend Paul Pelosi, was home alone. The assailant tried to take Paul hostage. He woke him up and he wanted to tie him up. The assailant ended up using a hammer to smash Paul\u2019s skull. Thankfully, by the grace of god, Paul survived. All this happened after the assault, and it just \u2013 it\u2019s hard to even say. After the assailant entered the home asking \u201cWhere\u2019s Nancy? Where\u2019s Nancy?\u201d Those are the very same words used by the mob when they stormed the United States Capitol on January the 6th, when they broke windows, kicked in the doors, brutally attacked law enforcement, roamed the corridors hunting for officials, and erected gallows to hang the former Vice President Mike Pence. It was an enraged mob that had been whipped up into a frenzy by a president repeating over and over again the big lie: that the election of 2020 had been stolen. It\u2019s a lie that fueled the dangerous rise in political violence and voter intimidation over the past two years. Even before January the 6th, we saw election officials and election workers in a number of states subject to menacing calls, physical threats, even threats to their very lives. In Georgia, for example, Republican secretary of state and his family were subjected to death threats because he refused to break the law and give into the defeated president\u2019s demand to just find him 11,780 votes. Just find me 11,780 votes. Election workers, like Shaye Moss and her mother Ruby Freeman, were harassed and threatened just because they had the courage to do their job and stand up for the truth, to stand up for our democracy. This institution, this intimidation, this violence against Democrats, Republicans, and nonpartisan officials just doing their jobs, are the consequence of lies told for power and profit. Lies of conspiracy and malice, lies repeated over and over to generate a cycle of anger, hate, vitriol and even violence. In this moment, we have to confront those lies with the truth. The very future of our nation depends on it. My fellow Americans, we\u2019re facing a defining moment. An inflexion point. We must with one overwhelming, unified voice speak as a country and say there\u2019s no place, no place for voter intimidation or political violence in America. Whether it\u2019s directed at Democrats or Republicans. No place, period. No place ever. I speak today near Capitol Hill, near the US Capitol, the citadel of our democracy. I know there\u2019s a lot of stake in these midterm elections, from our economy, to the safety of our streets, to our personal freedoms, to the future of health care and Social Security, Medicare. It\u2019s all important. But we\u2019ll have our differences, we\u2019ll have our difference of opinion. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be. But there\u2019s something else at stake: democracy itself. I\u2019m not the only one who sees it. Recent polls have shown an overwhelming majority of Americans believe our democracy is at risk, that our democracy\u2019s under threat. They too see that democracy is on the ballot this year, and they\u2019re deeply concerned about it. So today I appeal to all Americans, regardless of party, to meet this moment of national and generational importance. We must vote knowing what\u2019s at stake and not just the policy of the moment, but institutions that have held us together as we\u2019ve sought a more perfect union are also at stake. We must vote knowing who we have been, what we\u2019re at risk of becoming. Look, my fellow Americans, the old expression \u201cfreedom is not free,\u201d it requires constant vigilance. From the very beginning, nothing has been guaranteed about democracy in America. Every generation has had to defend it, protect it, preserve it, choose it. That\u2019s what democracy is. It\u2019s a choice, a decision of the people, by the people, and for the people. The issue couldn\u2019t be clearer, in my view. We the people must decide whether we will have fair and free elections, and every vote counts. We the people must decide whether we\u2019re going to sustain a republic where reality is accepted, the law is obeyed, and your vote is truly sacred. We the people must decide whether the rule of law will prevail or whether we will allow the dark forces and thirst for power put ahead of the principles that have long guided us. You know, American democracy is under attack because the defeated former president of the United States refused to accept the results of the 2020 election. If he refuses to accept the will of the people, refuses to accept the fact that he lost, he has abused his power and put the loyalty to himself before loyalty to the Constitution. And he\u2019s made a big lie, an article of faith in the MAGA Republican party, the minority of that party. The great irony about the 2020 election is that it\u2019s the most attacked election in our history. And yet, and yet, there\u2019s no election in our history that we can be more certain of its results. Every legal challenge that could have been brought, was brought. Every recount that could have been undertaken, was undertaken. Every recount confirmed the results. Wherever fact or evidence had been demanded, the big lie has been proven to be just that, a big lie. Every single time. Yet now, extreme MAGA Republicans aim to question not only the legitimacy of past elections, but elections being held now and into the future. The extreme MAGA element of the republican party, which is a minority of that party, as I said earlier, but it\u2019s its driving force. It\u2019s trying to succeed where they failed in 2020, to suppress the right of voters and subvert the electoral system itself. That means denying your right to vote and deciding whether your vote even counts. Instead of waiting until an election is over, they\u2019re starting well before it. They\u2019re starting now. They\u2019ve emboldened violence and intimidation of voters and election officials. It\u2019s estimated that there are more than 300 election deniers on the ballot all across America this year. We can\u2019t ignore the impact this is having on our country. It\u2019s damaging, it\u2019s corrosive, and it\u2019s destructive. And I want to be very clear, this is not about me, it\u2019s about all of us. It\u2019s about what makes America, America. It\u2019s about the durability of our democracy. For democracies are more than a form of government. They\u2019re a way of being, a way of seeing the world, a way that defines who we are, what we believe, why we do what we do. Democracy is simply that fundamental. We must, in this moment, dig deep within ourselves and recognize that we can\u2019t take democracy for granted any longer. With democracy on the ballot, we have to remember these first principles. Democracy means the rule of the people, not the rule of monarchs or the moneyed, but the rule of the people. Autocracy is the opposite of democracy. It means the rule of one, one person, one interest, one ideology, one party. To state the obvious, the lives of billions of people, from antiquity till now, have been shaped by the battle between these competing forces, between the aspirations of the many and the greed and power of the few, between the people\u2019s right for self-determination, and the self-seeking autocrat, between the dreams of a democracy and the appetites of an autocracy. What we\u2019re doing now is going to determine whether democracy will long endure and, in my view, is the biggest of questions, whether the American system that prizes the individual bends towards justice and depends on the rule of law, whether that system will prevail. This is the struggle we\u2019re now in, a struggle for democracy, a struggle for decency and dignity, a struggle for prosperity and progress, a struggle for the very soul of America itself. Make no mistake, democracy is on the ballot for all of us. We must remember that democracy is a covenant. We need to start looking out for each other again, seeing ourselves as we the people, not as entrenched enemies. This is a choice we can make. Disunion and chaos are not inevitable. There\u2019s been anger before in America. There\u2019s been division before in America. But we\u2019ve never given up on the American experiment, and we can\u2019t do that now. The remarkable thing about American democracy is this: just enough of us on just enough occasions have chosen not to dismantle democracy, but to preserve democracy. We must choose that path again. Because democracy is on the ballot, we have to remember that even in our darkest moments, there are fundamental values and beliefs that unite us as Americans, and they must unite us now. What are they? Well, I think, first, we believe the vote in America\u2019s sacred, to be honored, not denied, respected, not dismissed, counted, not ignored. A vote is not a partisan tool to be counted when it helps your candidates and tossed aside when it doesn\u2019t. Second, we must, with an overwhelming voice, stand against political violence and voter intimidation, period. Stand up and speak against it. We don\u2019t settle our differences, America, with a riot, a mob, or a bullet, or a hammer. We settle them peacefully at the ballot box. We have to be honest with ourselves, though. We have to face this problem. We can\u2019t turn away from it. We can\u2019t pretend it\u2019s just going to solve itself. There\u2019s an alarming rise in the number of our people in this country condoning political violence, or simply remain silent because silence is complicity. To the disturbing rise of voter intimidation, the pernicious tendency to excuse political violence, or at least, try to explain it away. We can\u2019t allow this sentiment to grow. We must confront it head on now. It has to stop now. I believe the voices excusing or calling for violence and intimidation are a distinct minority in America. But they\u2019re loud and they are determined. We have to be more determined. All of us who reject political violence and voter intimidation, and I believe that\u2019s the overwhelming majority of the American people, all of us must unite to make it absolutely clear that violence and intimidation have no place in America. And third, we believe in democracy. That\u2019s who we are as Americans. I know it isn\u2019t easy. Democracy\u2019s imperfect. It always has been. But you\u2019re all called to defend it now, now. History and common sense tell us that liberty, opportunity, and justice thrive in a democracy, not in an autocracy. At our best, America\u2019s not a zero-sum society \u2013 or for you to succeed, someone else has to fail. A promise in America is big enough, for everyone to succeed. Every generation, opening the door of opportunity just a little bit wider. Every generation, including those who\u2019ve been excluded before. We believe we should leave no one behind, because each one of us is a child of god, and every person, every person is sacred. If that\u2019s true, then every person\u2019s rights must be sacred as well. Individual dignity, individual worth, individual determination. That\u2019s America, that\u2019s democracy, and that\u2019s what we have to defend. Look, even as I speak here tonight, 27 million people have already cast their ballot in the midterm elections. Millions more will cast their ballots in the final days leading up to November the 9th \u2013 8th, excuse me. And for the first time, this is the first time since the national election of 2020, once again we\u2019re seeing record turnout all over the country. And that\u2019s good. We want Americans to vote. We want every American\u2019s voice to be heard. Now we have to move the process forward. We know that more and more ballots are cast in early voting or by mail in America. We know that many states don\u2019t start counting those ballots until after the polls close on November 8th. That means in some cases we won\u2019t know the winner of the election for a few days \u2013 until a few days after the election. It takes time to count all legitimate ballots in a legal and orderly manner. It\u2019s always been important for citizens in the democracy to be informed and engaged. Now it\u2019s important for a citizen to be patient as well. That\u2019s how this is supposed to work. This is also the first election since the events of January 6th, when the armed angry mob stormed the US Capitol. I wish I could say the assault on our democracy ended that day, but I cannot. As I stand here today, there are candidates running for every level of office in America, for governor, congress, attorney general, secretary of state, who won\u2019t commit, that will not commit to accepting the results of the election that they\u2019re running in. This is a path to chaos in America. It\u2019s unprecedented. It\u2019s unlawful, and it\u2019s un-American. As I\u2019ve said before, you can\u2019t love your country only when you win. This is no ordinary year. So I ask you to think long and hard about the moment we\u2019re in. In a typical year, we\u2019re often not faced with questions of whether the vote we cast will preserve democracy or put us at risk. But this year we are. This year I hope you\u2019ll make the future of our democracy an important part of your decision to vote and how you vote. I hope you\u2019ll ask a simple question of each candidate you might vote for. Will that person accept the legitimate will of the American people and the people voting in his district or her district? Will that person accept the outcome of the election, win or lose? The answer to that question is vital. And, in my opinion, it should be decisive. And the answer to that question hangs in the future of the country we love so much, and the fate of the democracy that has made so much possible for us. Too many people have sacrificed too much for too many years for us to walk away from the American project and democracy. Because we\u2019ve endured our freedoms for so long, it\u2019s easy to think they\u2019ll always be with us no matter what. But that isn\u2019t true today. In our bones, we know democracy is at risk. But we also know this: it\u2019s within our power, each and every one of us, to preserve our democracy.  And I believe we will. I think I know this country. I know we will. You have the power, it\u2019s your choice, it\u2019s your decision, the fate of the nation, the fate of the soul of America lies where it always does \u2013 with the people, in your hands, in your heart, in your ballot. My fellow Americans, we\u2019ll meet this moment. We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America. There\u2019s nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. May God bless those standing guard over our democracy. Thank you, and Godspeed.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden keeps touting the size of next year\u2019s increase in Social Security payments. But his boasts leave out critical context: Biden doesn\u2019t explain that the reason the 2023 increase will be unusually large is that the inflation rate has been unusually large. Nor was that context included in a misleading post from the White House\u2019s Twitter account on Tuesday \u2013 a post the White House deleted on Wednesday after it was widely criticized and Twitter affixed a fact-check to it. In addition, during a speech in Florida on Tuesday, Biden falsely claimed that the 2023 increase in Social Security payments will be the first increase in 10 years. In fact, there was an increase in every year of the Trump administration and the first two years of the Biden administration. Biden has repeatedly noted in recent weeks that Social Security payments will rise substantially in 2023. He has invoked the increase while reciting his accomplishments as president. \u201cOn our watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are going to get the biggest increase in their Social Security checks they\u2019ve gotten,\u201d Biden said in a speech last week at a Democratic fundraiser. The White House\u2019s Twitter account, which has more than eight million followers, was even more direct in crediting Biden for the increase. Its now-deleted Tuesday tweet read: \u201cSeniors are getting the biggest increase in their Social Security checks in 10 years through President Biden\u2019s leadership.\u201d It\u2019s true that the 2023 increase \u2013 8.7% \u2013 is the biggest in years, actually the biggest since 1981. But that\u2019s not because of any positive Biden achievement. Facts First: The increase in Social Security payments in 2023 is the biggest in years because the inflation rate has been the biggest in years. Under a law passed in the 1970s, Social Security payments must be increased by the same percentage that a certain measure of consumer prices has increased. The increase is known as a cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA. Why will there be an 8.7% cost-of-living adjustment in 2023? Because average prices in the third quarter of 2022, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), were up 8.7% from average prices in the third quarter of 2021. Asked about the White House\u2019s assertion that \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s leadership\u201d is responsible for the increase, Gary Engelhardt, a Syracuse University economics professor who studies Social Security, responded: \u201cThis assertion is incorrect.\u201d \u201cThe Social Security COLA is mandated by law (and has been for decades) and is tied to the rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index (i.e., inflation). President Biden has control over neither. From a political standpoint, it is a decidedly positive spin on a problem (inflation) plaguing his approval ratings,\u201d Engelhardt said in an email on Wednesday. Mary Johnson, Social Security and Medicare policy analyst at The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group, also dismissed the White House claim. \u201cIf inflation climbs then seniors will get more in their Social Security checks the following year to protect the buying power of their benefits. The fact that Biden took credit in this fashion sounds a lot like he\u2019s trying to make lemonade out of the inflation lemon,\u201d Johnson said in a Wednesday email. A second economics professor who studies retirement security, Teresa Ghilarducci of The New School, argued in an email that the White House tweet is \u201cmostly true\u201d \u2013 since Medicare Part B premiums, which are deducted from people\u2019s Social Security payments every month if they\u2019re enrolled in both programs, are going down next year, giving seniors a bigger \u201cNET Social Security check\u201d than they would otherwise get. Ghilarducci argued that the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to lower drug prices could have played a part in the decline in Medicare premiums. Regardless of why Medicare premiums fell, we respectfully say \u201cmostly true\u201d is much too generous. The Social Security cost-of-living increase that has nothing to do with any Biden achievement will increase monthly payments by an average of $146, while the monthly reduction in the standard Medicare premium, whatever its causes, will be $5.20. In other words, the vast majority of the reason that seniors will get more monthly money in 2023 is because of inflation, not because of any success on keeping drug prices in check. Asked at a Wednesday briefing about why the tweet was deleted, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, \u201cLook, the tweet was not complete. Usually, when we put out a tweet, we post it with context. And it did not have that context.\u201d Biden has emphasized in recent weeks that 2023 will be the first time in a decade that Social Security payments are going up at the same time as Medicare premiums are going down. Jean-Pierre identified this as \u201ca little bit of context\u201d the tweet was missing. In his Florida speech on Tuesday, Biden said again that people\u2019s Medicare costs are going down in 2023 for the first time in more than a decade. That\u2019s correct, though the decline follows a much larger spike under Biden in 2022. (That 2022 increase was driven in significant part by the need to plan to pay for a newly approved Alzheimer\u2019s drug; because the drugmaker ended up slashing the price of the drug and because Medicare restricted coverage of it, Medicare could pass savings back to Americans in 2023.) But then Biden made a separate claim about Social Security alone: \u201cAnd on my watch, for the first time in 10 years, seniors are getting an increase in their Social Security checks.\u201d Facts First: Biden\u2019s claim that this is the first time in 10 years that seniors are getting an increase in their Social Security checks is false. Inflation prompted an increase in Social Security payments every year from 2017 onward: 0.3% in 2017, 2.0% in 2018, 2.8% in 2019, 1.6% in 2020, 1.3% in 2021 and 5.9% in 2022. The context around Biden\u2019s Tuesday remark suggests he might have botched his usual scripted line about 2023 being the first time in a decade that Social Security payments to seniors are increasing at the same time as their Medicare payments are declining. Regardless of his intentions, though, this was a presidential address just a week before Election Day, and he said something that was plain wrong. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.",

            "article_content": "Bill Clinton made his case here Saturday for New York Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, the endangered chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, in a nearly half-hour speech in which the former president attacked Republicans over plans to slash social services and the increasing vitriol of right-wing political rhetoric. Clinton\u2019s appearance on the campaign trail for Maloney \u2013 a longtime ally, friend and former staffer \u2013 reflected the anxiety engulfing New York Democrats as Election Day nears. Maloney is in a tough fight against Republican assemblyman Mike Lawler as he runs for a sixth term representing a redrawn Lower Hudson Valley district north of New York City that now-President Joe Biden would have carried by 10 points in 2020. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which Maloney chairs, announced earlier this week it was spending $605,000 to back the congressman, with a new ad going up Tuesday that attacked Lawler and \u201cMAGA extremists.\u201d Speaking alongside Maloney on Saturday, Clinton argued that Democratic lawmakers and Biden had played a poor hand well and that Republicans, should they regain control of Congress, would only make the current challenges, such as inflation and crime, worse. Clinton acknowledged some voters\u2019 frustration and fears but insisted that the GOP had no plans to fix the country\u2019s problems \u2013 only stoking further anger and division.   \u201cIf you vote (Maloney) out and the other guy gets in, and Kevin McCarthy becomes the speaker of the House, he at least had the guts to tell us what his platform is,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHis platform is to cut Medicare, to cut Social Security. It\u2019s unbelievable. And go back to letting the drug companies charge whatever they want for drugs and take the cap off insulin prices and to cut back on aid to Ukraine and get back in bed with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin.\u201d Clinton offered a lengthy defense of US involvement in Ukraine, describing it as a moral imperative and noting that many wealthy European nations in worse economic shape than the US were staying the course. \u201cAmerica has lower interest rates, lower inflation rates and lower unemployment rates than all the wealthy European countries. And they\u2019re sticking by Ukraine. And we should too,\u201d he said. Clinton also touted, at length and in detail, the reasons for inflation today \u2013 it\u2019s a supply-side issue, he insisted, caused by disruption stemming from the pandemic. He argued more drilling in the US wouldn\u2019t lower energy prices given the country\u2019s \u201cinadequate refining capacity\u201d but new infrastructure would. All these issues, Clinton said, were going to be solved \u2013 though not \u201covernight\u201d \u2013 by legislation such as the CHIPS Act, written and delivered by Democrats. Clinton \u2013 and Maloney before him \u2013 was interrupted repeatedly by hecklers who shouted anti-vaccine misinformation and, when the former president was speaking, accused him of \u201csexually trafficking kids.\u201d \u201cYou ought to run down to my house and maybe I can get Secret Service and give you a tour of the basement,\u201d Clinton quipped back, before addressing what\u2019s known as \u201cPizzagate\u201d \u2013 a widely debunked conspiracy theory from 2016 that claimed the former president and his wife, Hillary Clinton, along with Democratic operatives, were running a pedophilia ring out of a pizzeria in Washington, DC. \u201cThey said the child trafficking ring was being run out of a pizza joint in Washington. There\u2019s no basement, there\u2019s no attic, there\u2019s no storage in the back. So they found a way to make these kids about six inches tall before they got back to normal size,\u201d he said. Clinton paused, then added: \u201cThis is why I support more spending on mental health, too.\u201d The former president concluded with a tribute to Maloney, calling on the voters in the audience to \u201cstick up\u201d for him and other Democrats who \u201ctook office in a terrible time and (are) making it better.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my case. I\u2019m totally biased. I love this man,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI plead totally guilty, but I got a pretty good argument to make \u2013 and I didn\u2019t have to scream to do it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden stepped up his effort to paint Republicans as a threat to Americans\u2019 pocketbooks in a speech from upstate New York on Thursday, a closing argument that focuses less on his own accomplishments and more on what the GOP might do if they take control of Congress. Biden\u2019s visit to a Syracuse, New York, community college was meant to tout Micron\u2019s pledge to invest $100 billion in semiconductor manufacturing, in part because of recent legislation that strengthened domestic chip production. But in his remarks, Biden also went after Republican plans that he argued would strip away some cost-lowering programs he\u2019s enacted while rewarding the rich with new tax cuts. \u201cRepublicans always used to have platforms,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t tell you what they\u2019re for. But they\u2019ll make sure to tell you what they\u2019re against.\u201d \u201cThen they\u2019re coming after Social Security,\u201d Biden added. \u201cThey\u2019re going to shut down the government, refuse to pay America\u2019s bills for the first time in American history to put America in default \u2026 unless we yield to their demands to cut Social Security and Medicare.\u201d \u201cNothing will create more chaos or do more damage to the American economy \u2026 than if it were to happen,\u201d Biden said. The event served as a real-time demonstration of a cold political reality. Despite shepherding one of the fastest economic recoveries in modern history, and securing four major cornerstone legislative wins tied to his economic agenda, economic discontent, particularly over high inflation, is still imperiling Democratic majorities in the House and Senate. \u201cWe can talk about what we\u2019ve done, all these huge legislative wins, \u2018til we\u2019re blue in the face,\u201d one Democratic campaign official said. \u201cIf people can\u2019t feel it, it doesn\u2019t matter at this point.\u201d The President has focused on drawing a contrast between the two parties for weeks, but his sharpened message comes as Democrats grow increasingly concerned about the possibility the narrow universe of undecided voters could break sharply against their party in the closing days of the campaign. Syracuse, in particular, stands to benefit from a key Biden priority \u2013 semiconductor manufacturing \u2013 but it is also the center of a competitive House race, where a conservative Trump-aligned Republican is running against a moderate Democrat in a contest that\u2019s currently a toss-up. The seat is being vacated by retiring incumbent Republican Rep. John Katko. New York State\u2019s gubernatorial election has also tightened in recent weeks, with the Democratic incumbent Gov. Kathy Hochul battling Rep. Lee Zeldin in a race that\u2019s focused heavily on increasing crime rates. While Biden has spent much of this year\u2019s midterm contests highlighting the steps he\u2019s taken to reduce costs for Americans and boost American manufacturing, polls show Americans giving him poor marks on his handling of the economy. He\u2019s attempting to use Thursday as a moment to bridge the pervasive disconnect between an economy he\u2019s called \u201cstrong as hell\u201d and voters who believe the exact opposite. The President received some good news Thursday morning: Gross domestic product \u2014 the broadest measure of economic activity \u2014 rose by an annualized rate of 2.6% during the third quarter, according to initial estimates released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It represents a sharp bounce back after two quarters of negative growth that became a magnet for GOP attacks. But in a demonstration of the political reality, Biden\u2019s political advisers framed the day around an aggressive attack on Republican economic proposals. At the heart of the political message is something that has appeared prominently in Biden\u2019s own remarks in recent days. \u201cEverybody wants to make it a referendum, but it\u2019s a choice,\u201d Biden said in a speech earlier this week, detailing his view that Republican congressional majorities \u201care going to crash the economy.\u201d Biden, who has mostly avoided large campaign rallies in favor of official events meant to promote his agenda, has sharpened his attacks recently on Republicans for threatening to undo the steps he says have lowered costs for Americans. \u201cThere are two very different ways of looking at our country. One is, as I\u2019ve said before, the view from Park Avenue, which says help the wealthy and maybe that\u2019ll trickle down to everyone in the country. The other is from Scranton or Claymont or thousands of cities across the country like the place I grew up,\u201d he said at the White House on Wednesday, referencing towns in which he lived as a child in Pennsylvania and Delaware. Still, he acknowledged that many Americans had yet to feel the benefit of an improving economy. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic. It\u2019s going to take some time. And I appreciate the frustration of the American people,\u201d he said. Democratic officials hope Biden\u2019s message will resonate in the final stretch of the campaign as Republican appear to be gaining momentum. Biden himself is expected to continue traveling in the days ahead of the election, along with members of his Cabinet. A White House official said members of the Cabinet had traveled to 29 states since October 1 on 77 different trips to amplify Biden\u2019s message. \u201cWe are entering a period here where the choice before the American people is incredibly stark, and the President\u2019s going to continue to illustrate exactly the impact that the mega MAGA trickle-down agenda the congressional Republicans have put forward is going to have on families, and he\u2019s going to continue pressing that case from now and for the weeks to come,\u201d the official said. Biden\u2019s midterm campaign schedule so far has focused mostly on states he won in the 2020 election that nonetheless feature closer-than-expected races.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Friday gave a window into how he\u2019s preparing for a looming political showdown over the debt ceiling, stating unequivocally that he will not relent to Republican lawmakers threatening to send the nation into default if he doesn\u2019t meet their demands, but adding that he doesn\u2019t support Democrats\u2019 efforts to abolish the debt limit entirely. In remarks at the White House less than three weeks before the midterm elections, the President touted a $1.4 trillion decline in the federal deficit and discussed what he sees as dire fiscal consequences if Republicans regain majorities in Congress. The GOP, Biden argued, will \u201cthreaten the very foundations of the American economy if we don\u2019t meet their demands.\u201d \u201cThey will crash the economy next year by threatening the full faith and credit of the United States for the first time in our history, putting the United States in default unless we yield to their demand to cut Social Security and Medicare,\u201d he said. \u201cLet me be really clear. I will not yield. I will not cut Social Security. I will not cut Medicare, no matter how hard they work at it.\u201d Biden\u2019s decision to directly address the debt ceiling issue at all \u2013 and draw early red lines for any potential negotiation \u2013 elevates a very real concern simmering among lawmakers facing the possibility of Republican majorities. The debt limit has been a threshold that has driven fiscal battles \u2013 and one downgrade of the nation\u2019s credit rating \u2013 over more than a decade, and several House Republicans have made clear they plan to use it to extract policy wins. House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy, likely the next speaker should Republicans win the majority in November, thrust the issue to the forefront with comments earlier this week that echoed those of several colleagues. \u201cIf people want to make a debt ceiling (for a longer period of time), just like anything else, there comes a point in time where, OK, we\u2019ll provide you more money, but you got to change your current behavior,\u201d he said in an interview with Punchbowl News. Quietly, there have been early stage discussions on both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue regarding how to deal with the equivalent of the ticking time bomb that an increase or suspension to the nation\u2019s borrowing limit represents. While Congress set the limit to curtail government borrowing, lawmakers have routinely raised it every time it has been hit. Biden\u2019s unequivocal response to Republican threats came the same day several House Democrats sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer calling for legislation to \u201cpermanently undo the debt limit\u201d during the post-election lame-duck session on Capitol Hill. The letter, led by Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, was signed by several prominent House Democrats, including Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Biden said on Friday that he does not support legislation that would permanently repeal the debt ceiling, a proposal he called \u201cirresponsible.\u201d However, there are other potential pathways to address the debt limit in the lame duck session, even if the tight timeline and packed agenda would appear to make any effort a heavy lift. Biden\u2019s stance on the issue puts him at odds with Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who in 2021 expressed support for legislation to abolish the debt ceiling. \u201cI think it\u2019s become increasingly damaging to America to have a debt ceiling,\u201d Yellen told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett Out Front\u201d last year. \u201cIt\u2019s led to a series of politically dangerous conflicts that have caused Americans and global markets to question whether or not America is serious about paying its bills. It\u2019s flirting with the self inflicted crisis and it really involves the government giving to their treasury secretary and their president conflicting sets of instructions.\u201d Mandates instructing Treasury to cover expenditures, authorize tax collections and set a requirement that can\u2019t let the debt run above a given limit \u201ccan come into conflict,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible situation.\u201d She continued, \u201cCongress needs to debate these issues when they\u2019re deciding on spending in taxation, not to every several years, put a hard stop and say, well, \u2018Now, we\u2019re not going to let the Treasury secretary pay the nation\u2019s bills.\u2019\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appears in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The final 2022 primary elections, conducted Tuesday, saw more clear victories for the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d wing of the GOP. The more moderate Republican running for US Senate in New Hampshire, state Senate President Chuck Morse, conceded defeat Wednesday to the 2020 election-denying retired US Army Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc. In fact, it was a sweep of House and Senate races in New Hampshire for the more Trump-aligned candidates. The Senate race was yet another case of the candidate preferred by the Republican establishment in Washington, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, falling to a candidate who pushes conspiracy theories and was aligned with former President Donald Trump. It wasn\u2019t enough that a super PAC aligned with McConnell had poured more than $4 million into the race to pump up Morse. In this particular case, it should also be noted that Democrats helped Bolduc along by spending millions to run ads attacking Morse and tying him to McConnell. Democrats\u2019 cynical strategy of helping the Trumpier GOP candidates in multiple states and races is a dangerous gamble that could either help them keep control of the Senate or could put more election deniers in office, depending on what happens in November. It also undercuts their message of trying to protect democracy. As CNN\u2019s political team reported in takeaways from the New Hampshire primary, \u201cBolduc joins a list of candidates national Republicans worry won\u2019t be able to appeal to the broader November electorate.\u201d Read more takeaways. Bolduc is the kind of candidate who has talked about abolishing the FBI and repealing the 17th Amendment, which requires states to directly elect their senators. While Trump didn\u2019t technically endorse Bolduc and he ran unsuccessful primary campaigns in the past, he joins Georgia\u2019s Herschel Walker, Arizona\u2019s Blake Masters, Pennsylvania\u2019s Dr. Mehmet Oz and Ohio\u2019s J.D. Vance in the camp of Trump-endorsed, first-time candidates in danger of losing seats Republican leaders must win to get control of the Senate. There was more evidence of MAGA-fication in a primary for New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District, which pitted two former Trump administration aides against each other. The one who expressed confidence in elections lost. From CNN\u2019s report: Where (Matt) Mowers had \u201cconfidence in New Hampshire elections,\u201d (Karoline) Leavitt said she believed \u201cthe 2020 election was undoubtedly stolen from President Trump.\u201d Where Mowers suggested hearings to determine whether President Joe Biden should be impeached, Leavitt unequivocally said the President should be impeached. And where Mowers said he \u201csupports science\u201d when asked about the newly rolled out coronavirus vaccine, Leavitt said it was \u201cnone of your business.\u201d CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale writes Wednesday that more than half of Republican Senate candidates have \u201crejected, cast doubt upon or tried to overturn the 2020 election results.\u201d Nineteen of the GOP primary winners have questioned the 2020 results, according to Dale\u2019s list, which includes five incumbent senators and 11 other candidates who could feasibly win in November. There\u2019s an even longer list of candidates for governor \u2013 at least 22 \u2013 and secretary of state \u2013 at least 11 \u2013 who have espoused similar theories and will be in a position to influence the way elections are carried out in their states if they win in November. On the other hand, most of the Republicans who voted to impeach Trump have been purged by GOP primary voters or had announced plans for retirement. Most notably, Rep. Liz Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who has helped lead the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, insurrection, lost her primary in August. Just two of the 10 Republican House members who voted to impeach Trump, Reps. David Valadao of California and Dan Newhouse of Washington state, will be on the ballot in November. So will Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the only Republican senator who voted for impeachment and is up for reelection this year. CNN\u2019s Adam Wollner looked at how these few Republicans have survived and notes Murkowski is something of a political anomaly. She won reelection in 2010 with a write-in campaign after losing that GOP primary, which is the political equivalent of pulling a rabbit out of a hat. But more importantly, he identified the one thing that ties the three surviving impeachment Republicans together: \u201cMurkowski, Newhouse and Valadao did not face a traditional Republican primary,\u201d Wollner wrote in August. \u201cInstead, they participated in contests where all candidates, regardless of party, appeared on the same ballot. In California and Washington, the top two finishers move on to the general election, while the top four advance in Alaska.\u201d Read more of Wollner\u2019s analysis. The Brookings Institution did a more holistic review of primary candidates from both parties and found that Republicans have embraced Trump and his brand of conservatism far more completely than Democrats have embraced their most progressive ideas. Seven takeaways from the 2022 primary season Trump endorsed less than 13% of GOP candidates, but more than 96% of those he endorsed won their primaries. Most Republican candidates \u2013 nearly 60% in the Brookings review \u2013 put no mention of Trump or his MAGA and America First mantras on their website. But only 30% of those candidates who didn\u2019t push Trumpism won. Brookings compared those figures with the percentage of Democrats who embraced the left wing of the party. Most \u2013 72% of Democratic candidates \u2013 had no endorsement from left-wing groups and no mention of left-wing issues \u2013 anything from Medicare for all to defund the police \u2013 on their website. Nearly half of these won their primaries. A small minority of Democrats, just about 6%, were endorsed by extremely progressive leaders like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or groups that share his priorities. Half of them won their primaries. Brookings\u2019 conclusion: \u201cOn the Republican side, candidates have embraced Trump \u2013 even when he has not embraced them \u2013 and done very well in the primaries because of it. On the Democratic side, the impact of Bernie Sanders\u2019 revolution has been smaller, more muted, and less successful in primaries.\u201d CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect which candidates former President Donald Trump has endorsed.",

            "article_content": "Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott tweeted a picture of himself on Tuesday standing outside the White House with this caption: \u201c.@JoeBiden said he wished he had enough copies of my Rescue America plan, so I stopped by the White House today to make sure he did. Thanks for spreading the word, Joe!\u201d Scott was holding a copy of his plan, a blueprint, he insists, of what Republicans will do if they retake the Senate majority in the midterm elections. Biden was clearly thrilled with Scott\u2019s post. \u201cCouldn\u2019t agree more, Rick,\u201d the President responded on Twitter. \u201cAnd if anyone else wants to read your plan to put Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block, they should go to http://joebiden.com/rickscottsplan.\u201d The back and forth marked the latest effort by Biden and his team to elevate Scott and his \u201cRescue America\u201d plan as the general election approaches. In a speech late last month, Biden said this: \u201cRick Scott, the \u2013 who heads up the ultra-MAGA agenda for the Republicans, he\u2019s the head of the Senate campaign committee for the Republicans. \u2026 He said \u2013 he thinks everyone in America should pay taxes \u2013 not more taxes \u2013 everyone in America should pay taxes. All those folks making less than $100,000 a year, if they have some exemption, they should have to pay net more taxes. Average increase expected to be $1,200 bucks for every American under that amount. \u201cWell, beyond that, he says that we should try to be in a situation where we \u2013 Congress, every five years, has to affirmatively vote to maintain Social Security, which you paid for your whole life. You have to affirmatively vote. It comes up \u2013 if it\u2019s not positively voted for, it\u2019s gone, it\u2019s eliminated. And you think I\u2019m making this up; it\u2019s not. It\u2019s the only written Republican platform so far.\u201d And back in May, Biden echoed that same message: \u201cSen. Rick Scott of [Florida], a member of the Senate Republican leadership, laid it all out in a plan. It\u2019s the ultra-MAGA agenda. Their plan is to raise taxes on 75 million American families, over 95 percent of whom make less than $100,000 a year, total income.\u201d Let\u2019s take a quick step back and look at what is actually in Scott\u2019s proposal. It is true that in Scott\u2019s plan, all federal legislation \u2013 including Social Security and Medicare \u2013 would automatically sunset after five years, forcing Congress to re-approve those benefits. And in Scott\u2019s original plan, he proposed that all Americans pay some form of income tax \u2013 although he backed away from that over the summer. (Here are 24 other things Scott\u2019s \u201cRescue America\u201d plan would do.) Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has argued, repeatedly, that voters need to know what the party would do if handed power in the midterm elections. That is not a view broadly held within the Senate GOP conference. Most notably, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has repeatedly thrown shade at Scott\u2019s plan. \u201cWe will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years,\u201d McConnell said shortly after the release of Scott\u2019s plan. \u201cThat will not be a part of the Republican Senate majority agenda.\u201d (McConnell has long been a believer that Republicans do not need a detailed agenda in order to win back Senate control \u2013 and that instead they need to keep all of the attention on the Democrats\u2019 plans and actions.) Scott responded with an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, in which he went after McConnell without naming him. \u201cIf we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to socialism, we don\u2019t deserve to govern,\u201d wrote Scott. \u201cMost Republicans in Congress agree, but many live in fear of speaking the truth in Washington. If you do, the Democrats will attack you and use it against you. Therefore, they tell us, it\u2019s best to keep your head down, vote as directed, and be quiet.\u201d Biden\u2019s decision to elevate Scott \u2013 and to make him, along with former President Donald Trump, the de facto faces of the Republican Party in this election \u2013 is McConnell\u2019s worst nightmare come true. Recent Democratic polling gains in the generic congressional ballot, as well as improvements in Biden\u2019s job approval rating, are due to the growing sense that the 2022 election isn\u2019t going to be a referendum on Biden and Democrats, but rather a choice between the visions of governance laid out by the opposing parties. To be sure, the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade has played a critical role in the evolution of the election from a referendum into a choice. But Biden and his fellow Democrats are working hard to make Scott and his \u201cRescue America\u201d plan into something that every voter knows about this fall.",

            "article_content": "GOP senators are privately alarmed at the cash problems facing Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s National Republican Senatorial Committee, uneasy over his feud with Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell and worried that their internal issues could undercut their already difficult road back to the majority this fall.   Behind the scenes, GOP senators are maneuvering to make up for the committee\u2019s cash shortfall, with discussions underway to take matters into their own hands to circumvent the NRSC entirely and directly help candidates who need critical resources down the homestretch of the high-stakes campaign, according to multiple GOP sources. A new fear among Republicans: The NRSC won\u2019t be able to bankroll its part to target voters with direct mail and urge them to come to the polls in key battleground states, something that the party committee spent tens of millions of dollars to do during the 2020 cycle. McConnell, meanwhile, has been on the phone with big donors for the past several weeks \u2013 going well beyond his traditional call list \u2013 in an effort to ensure his high-spending super PAC, the Senate Leadership Fund, is flush with cash to spend huge sums on TV ads in battleground states in the campaign\u2019s final two months, one senior GOP source said. In an August meeting with GOP senators, McConnell urged members to transfer money from their leadership PACs to the Senate Leadership Fund even after a presentation showing that Senate GOP leaders had given far less to the NRSC than top House Republicans have given to their campaign arm, a source familiar with the matter said. Just two GOP senators ponied up to the NRSC after that presentation. \u201cWell, it concerns me a lot,\u201d Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a member of McConnell\u2019s leadership team and former NRSC chairman, when asked about the money the committee is burning through. \u201cThe Democrats are going to vastly outspend Republicans across the board. But as long as we have enough money to tell our story and to defend our opposition, I think we\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Other prominent Republicans have also been taking matters into their own hands. Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota has been in talks with candidates over setting up joint fundraising committees to help them directly, according to a source familiar with the matter, and has raised concerns with the NRSC\u2019s cash problems. In the past week, The New York Times published a detailed report on the committee\u2019s dire financial shape after betting big on digital fundraising, and Scott wrote an explosive op-ed implicitly criticizing McConnell for publicly questioning the \u201cquality\u201d of their own candidates (Scott denied on Tuesday he was taking aim at McConnell). \u201cI think we need to be united in our message,\u201d Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said Tuesday. \u201cWe have a great opportunity here and so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good strategy to be feuding two months before the election.\u201d Do Senate Republicans have a candidate problem? The NRSC raised $181.5 million through the end of July but had on hand only $23.2 million. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee raised less \u2013 $173.1 million \u2013 but had on hand $54.1 million, more than twice the NRSC\u2019s amount. SLF, which can raise unlimited sums from individuals and groups, had on hand over $104 million at the end of June, according to the latest FEC report. \u201cThey were handed a rare custom built, one-of-a kind Ferrari that took 10 years to build \u2013 and they drop the hammer and drove it right into a brick wall,\u201d one long-time GOP strategist said. NRSC spokesman Chris Hartline said the disparity in cash stems from the organization\u2019s decision to strategically spend tens of millions of dollars on ads early in the contests to boost Republicans. He said that Scott \u201chas been clear\u201d with everyone since the beginning of the 2022 cycle \u2013 \u201cand it\u2019s working.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in a better position in every one of our target states than we were at the beginning of the summer, largely because the NRSC has been spending early and heavily to support our candidates and define the Democrats,\u201d Hartline said. \u201cWe invested in tripling our house file, an investment that is paying off now and will continue to pay off for cycles to come.\u201d \u201cHe told everyone what he was going to do, he did it, and it\u2019s working,\u201d added Hartline. \u201cIf anyone is surprised, they haven\u2019t been paying attention.\u201d Scott\u2019s joint fundraising committee has given over $8 million to the NRSC, according to the latest FEC reports. McConnell Victory Committee and Team McConnell have given nearly $700,000 to the NRSC. But there are growing concerns over campaigns\u2019 efforts to turn out voters on Election Day \u2013 in no small part due to the committee\u2019s cash shortfalls. During the 2020 election cycle, when the committee was run by Indiana Sen. Todd Young, NRSC Targeted State Victory, a joint fundraising committee, raised over $18 million and sent hundreds of thousands of dollars to a number of state party committees to help voters get to the polls. It raised another $1 million between January and March 2021 before the NRSC shut it down. Since then, the NRSC created another joint fundraising committee, Take Back the Senate, which raised just $1.2 million from April 2021 through June 2022. \u201cThe real problem I hear from campaigns is a hole in the budget for turnout mail,\u201d said the first GOP strategist. Scott made the decision early in the cycle to abandon the tactics of his predecessors and maintain a hands-off posture during the primaries. That approach, Republicans privately complained, ended up hurting some candidates \u2013 particularly in Ohio and Arizona \u2013 as they pivoted to the general election from the primary. Since some lacked candidate training, access to critical research and experienced staff and fundraisers that the NRSC has given candidates in previous cycles, it provided well-funded Democratic candidates a chance to bombard the airwaves while their GOP opponents were still finding their general election footing. The NRSC has said that it has worked closely with various candidates and will do what is necessary to win in November. Sprint to the midterms sets off on unsettled political terrain In past election cycles, McConnell was heavily involved in the NRSC. But as his disagreements with Scott\u2019s approach intensified, he has instead focused his efforts squarely on his super PAC. \u201cMcConnell decided rather than fight this to focus all his efforts on SLF,\u201d a source familiar with the matter said. The issue came back to the fore last month, when McConnell acknowledged that \u201ccandidate quality\u201d could hurt the party\u2019s ability to take back the chamber. The comments were in line with comments the GOP leader had been making for years about Senate races, but it was interpreted as a dig at some of the lackluster performances of the GOP field so far. Last week, Scott fired back. He told Politico that he and McConnell \u201cclearly have a strategic disagreement\u201d over the party\u2019s candidates. The Florida Republican also wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner, lashing unnamed Republicans for acting \u201ctreasonous to the conservative cause.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, many of the very people responsible for losing the Senate last cycle are now trying to stop us from winning the majority this time by trash-talking our Republican candidates,\u201d Scott wrote. While Scott did not mention McConnell by name, his op-ed was widely viewed as a broadside launched against the GOP leader and his allies. Asked if Scott\u2019s op-ed was helpful, Thune said: \u201cWell,\u201d and walked into McConnell\u2019s office. McConnell, as he left the Senate floor, walked in silence when asked by reporters about Scott. Scott claimed on Tuesday that the piece was not directed at McConnell. \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about somebody else,\u201d said Scott, as he was leaving McConnell\u2019s office after a leadership meeting. \u201cIt said people who are doing anonymous quotes and trashing our candidates, yeah, it\u2019s treasonous to the conservative cause.\u201d Privately, though the assessment is different. \u201cMcConnell\u2019s comments hurt Republican candidates,\u201d a source close to Scott said. \u201cAnyone who disagrees with that is either an idiot or on McConnell\u2019s payroll.\u201d A senior GOP strategist fired back. \u201cIf you don\u2019t know the difference between how House and Senate campaigns are financed, you probably shouldn\u2019t advertise that in September of an election year if you\u2019re in charge of Senate elections,\u201d the strategist said. Scott, who may run for President in 2024, is expected to appear with a House candidate in Iowa this month, as well as Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. The back-and-forth has made GOP senators uncomfortable. \u201cIt\u2019s clear to me that Republicans need to rally around their candidates if we are ever going to have success, and we can\u2019t afford to have divisions within our conference,\u201d said Kansas Sen. Jerry Moran, a former NRSC chairman who is up for reelection this year. \u201cIt\u2019s always best to stand behind Mitch McConnell,\u201d said Sen. Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican of North Carolina, said the spat over the NRSC is \u201ca distraction from what voters are going to be motivated by,\u201d maintaining he does have confidence in Scott to run the NRSC, while acknowledging it\u2019s a mistake for Republicans to be infighting instead of battling Democrats. \u201cI don\u2019t think it ever makes sense \u2013 I\u2019ve been doing this since 2007 \u2013 and it always makes sense to focus on who you want to defeat in November, not each other,\u201d he said. Scott and McConnell, the longest-serving Senate Republican leader, have also sparred over Scott\u2019s decision to release a plan to \u201crescue America\u201d that at least briefly shifted the attention from Republicans\u2019 perceived failures of the Biden administration. The White House sharply criticized Scott\u2019s provisions to have every American pay at least some income tax and to sunset all federal laws in five years. Democrats still are bashing the plan on the campaign trail, something McConnell feared as he sought to shy away from offering an election-year agenda that Democrats could attack. \u201cLet me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda,\u201d said McConnell at a news conference after Scott unveiled his plan. \u201cWe will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.\u201d In June, Scott dropped the controversial provisions in a revised proposal. On Tuesday, the feud did not come up during a leadership meeting in McConnell\u2019s office, according to Cornyn. And when asked directly if he had complete confidence in Scott, Cornyn instead said: \u201cI have complete confidence that he wants to do what we all want to do, which is win the majority back and it\u2019s certainly \u2013 it\u2019s very competitive.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information Tuesday.

            "article_content": "National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Rick Scott pushed back on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell for acknowledging last month that \u201ccandidate quality\u201d could hurt the party\u2019s ability to take back the chamber. On Thursday, Politico published an interview with Scott saying that he and McConnell have a \u201cstrategic disagreement\u201d over the party\u2019s candidates, and the Washington Examiner released an op-ed by Scott taking issue with the view that they could cost the GOP the Senate. \u201cIf you want to talk about the need to raise more money to promote our candidates versus the Democrats\u2019 terrible candidates, I agree,\u201d wrote the Florida Republican senator. \u201cIf you want to trash-talk our candidates to help the Democrats, pipe down. That\u2019s not what leaders do. And Republicans need to be leaders that build up the team and do everything they can to get the entire team over the finish line.\u201d \u201cUltimately, though, when you complain and lament that we have \u2018bad candidates,\u2019 what you are really saying is that you have contempt for the voters who chose them. Now we are at the heart of the matter,\u201d added Scott. \u201cMuch of Washington\u2019s chattering class disrespects and secretly (or not so secretly) loathes Republican voters.\u201d A McConnell spokesperson declined a request for comment. Scott\u2019s op-ed did not explicitly mention McConnell\u2019s name, but its targets \u2014 the Senate minority leader and Republican strategists anonymously quoted dismissing the party\u2019s own candidates \u2014 were clear. Last month, McConnell said that \u201cthere\u2019s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate,\u201d noting that \u201ccandidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome\u201d of Senate races. Afterwards, McConnell has praised Republican candidates, including saying Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania \u201chas a great shot at winning.\u201d But the Senate Leadership Fund, a McConnell-aligned Super PAC, announced it would spend $28 million in Ohio, a state former President Donald Trump won in 2020 by eight points, as Senate Republican nominee J.D. Vance struggles against Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan. Republicans are also concerned about their Senate candidates in Georgia, Arizona and elsewhere. \u201cSen. McConnell and I clearly have a strategic disagreement here. \u2026 We have great candidates,\u201d Scott told Politico. \u201cHe wants to do the same thing I want to do: I want to get a majority.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed into law a bill aimed at boosting American chip manufacturing as he kicked off a victory lap to celebrate a string of wins in Washington. The CHIPS and Science Act will invest more than $200 billion over the next five years in a bid to help the US regain a leading position in semiconductor chip manufacturing. It is aimed at countering China\u2019s growing economic influence, lowering the cost of goods, making the US less reliant on foreign manufacturing and mitigating supply chain disruptions in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Biden on Tuesday described the law as a \u201conce-in-a-generation investment in America itself.\u201d \u201cToday America is delivering, delivering, and I honest to God believe that 50, 75, 100 years from now from people who will look back on this week, they\u2019ll know that we met this moment,\u201d Biden said at an event on the White House South Lawn. The President, who recently emerged from isolation after a rebound case of Covid-19, coughed throughout his speech. A major focus of the bill is on making the US more competitive with China. The US was once a leader in semiconductor manufacturing but now many American manufacturers import chips made elsewhere as other countries like China ramp up production. The share of semiconductor manufacturing capacity located in the US has decreased from 37% in 1990 to 12% today, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. The event was attended by union leaders, industry executives from companies such as HP and Intel, congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle and state elected officials. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo also spoke at the event. According to the White House, companies this week announced nearly $50 billion in additional investments in American semiconductor manufacturing as a result of the newly passed legislation. \u201cMicron is announcing a $40 billion investment in memory chip manufacturing, critical for computers and electronic devices, which will create up to 40,000 new jobs\u201d in construction and manufacturing, a White House fact sheet says. \u201cThis investment alone will bring the U.S. market share of memory chip production from 2 percent to 10 percent.\u201d Additionally, Qualcomm and GlobalFoundries announced a new partnership that includes $4.2 billion to manufacture chips. Later Tuesday, Biden also signed the ratification of the accession of Sweden and Finland to NATO. The addition of the two traditionally neutral countries to the alliance represented a major foreign policy accomplishment for Biden during a trip to Europe for summits in June. Biden said their addition to the alliance would make it \u201cstronger than ever.\u201d \u201cSweden and Finland have strong democratic institutions, strong militaries, and strong and transparent economies,\u201d he said from the East Room of the White House. \u201cThey\u2019ll meet every NATO requirement \u2013 we\u2019re confident of that \u2013 and will make \u2026 our alliance stronger and will make America and the American people safer in the process.\u201d And on Wednesday, the President will sign the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promises to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act of 2022 into law. The legislation expands health care benefits for millions of veterans exposed to toxic burn pits during their military service. The bill widely expands health care resources and benefits to those exposed to burn pits and could provide coverage for up to 3.5 million veterans who qualify. It adds conditions related to burn pit and toxic exposure, including hypertension, to the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 list of illnesses that have been incurred or exacerbated during military service. Biden has long speculated that burn pits played a role in the cancer that killed his son, Beau, in 2015. The bill signings \u2013 along with other related accomplishments like the recent targeted killing of Osama bin Laden\u2019s successor and continued declining gas prices \u2013 amount to the possibility that Biden may get the pre-midterms boost Democrats have been hoping for. With the 2022 midterm elections less than 100 days away, and as Americans have grown discontented through a summer of major economic and political changes, Biden\u2019s political standing among the public has declined. A CNN poll released in mid-July found that nearly 7 in 10 Americans had said that Biden had not been paying enough attention to the nation\u2019s most pressing problems. The President\u2019s approval rating, in the poll, stood at 38%. And at the end of July, another CNN poll found that 75% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters wanted the party to nominate someone other than Biden in the 2024 presidential election. Before the month\u2019s end, Biden could have some other major opportunities to claim political victories. Biden faces the real prospect of soon signing into law the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 a version of his landmark climate change and health care bill. The sweeping bill passed in the Senate along party lines and the House is expected to vote on it later this week. The legislation would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would reduce the deficit, be paid for through new taxes \u2013 including a 15% minimum tax on large corporations and a 1% tax on stock buybacks \u2013 and boost the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s ability to collect. It would raise over $700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over $430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit. The President will also have to make a decision about whether to extend the nation\u2019s ongoing mass federal student loan forbearance before it is scheduled to end on August 31. Biden is also weighing the possibility of canceling some student loans. It\u2019s an issue that\u2019s sharply divided among partisan and generational lines, but one that could act as yet another political boon among some voters as the country continues to grapple with inflation raising the cost of everyday goods and services.

            "article_content": "The Senate has worked through the night and into Sunday morning, taking a series of back-to-back amendment votes that are among the last steps toward final passage of Democrats\u2019 sweeping health care and climate bill \u2013 putting the package on track to be approved by the chamber as soon as this weekend. The process is known on Capitol Hill as a \u201cvote-a-rama,\u201d and started Saturday night shortly after 11:30 p.m. ET, and which is expected to stretch well into Sunday. A vote on final passage of the bill will take place when amendment votes end, the timing of which it is not yet clear. The bill \u2013 named the Inflation Reduction Act \u2013 would represent the largest climate investment in US history and make major changes to health policy by giving Medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years. The legislation would impose new taxes to pay for it. The package is the product of painstaking negotiations and will give Democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. Senate Democrats are using a special process to pass the package without Republican votes. Once the legislation has passed in the Senate, it would next need to be approved by the House of Representatives before President Joe Biden could sign it into law. Following the procedural vote to proceed to the bill, the Senate entered debate before moving into the \u201cvote-a-rama.\u201d The marathon series of amendment votes with no time limit must run its course before a final vote can take place. Republicans are using the \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d to put Democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes, and votes on contentious policy issues are expected. As expected, key insulin provisions were struck out of the bill after Republicans raised a point of order, resulting in a vote to strip them out. The final vote was 57-43. A 60-vote threshold was needed to keep the provision in place. The provisions initially included in the bill would have limited insulin prices to $35 per month in both the private insurance market as well as through Medicare. But the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the cap on insulin in the private insurance market was not compliant with the reconciliation rules Democrats are utilizing to push their legislation through the chamber. Democrats kept both provisions in the bill anyway, but Republicans raised a point of order to force a vote to strike the provisions only from the private marketplace. The Medicare $35 insulin cap remains in place. The House is poised to come back to take up the legislation on Friday, August 12, according to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer\u2019s office. Senate Democrats only need a simple majority for final passage of the bill since they are using a process known as reconciliation, which allows them to avoid a Republican filibuster and corresponding 60-vote threshold. In order to pass a bill through the reconciliation process, however, the package must comply with a strict set of budget rules. The Senate parliamentarian has to decide whether the provisions in the bill meet the rules to allow Democrats to use the filibuster-proof budget process to pass the legislation along straight party lines. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced Saturday that after undergoing the parliamentarian\u2019s review, the bill \u201cremains largely intact.\u201d \u201cThe bill, when passed, will meet all of our goals \u2013 fighting climate change, lowering health care costs, closing tax loopholes abused by the wealthy and reducing the deficit,\u201d the New York Democrat said. In a key ruling, the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, allowed a major component of the Democrats\u2019 prescription drug pricing plans to move ahead \u2013 giving Medicare the power to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs for the first time. But MacDonough narrowed another provision aimed at lowering drug prices \u2013 imposing penalties on drug companies if they increase their prices faster than inflation. Democrats had wanted the measure to apply both to Medicare and the private insurance market. But the parliamentarian ruled the inflation cap could only apply to Medicare, a Democratic aide said. Meanwhile, MacDonough ruled to keep intact several climate measures from the Environment and Public Works Committee in the reconciliation bill, including a methane fee that would apply to oil and gas producers leaking the potent greenhouse gas methane above a certain threshold. Earlier Saturday, Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden of Oregon announced that the clean energy tax portion of the bill \u201cadheres to Senate rules, and important provisions to ensure our clean energy future is built in America have been approved by the parliamentarian.\u201d For a party that failed to pass major climate legislation over 10 years ago, the reconciliation bill represents a major, long-fought victory for Democrats. The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in US history, and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark Clean Air Act. It also comes at a critical time; this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country, which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet. Analysis from Schumer\u2019s office \u2013 as well as multiple independent analyses \u2013 suggests the measures would reduce US carbon emissions by up to 40% by 2030. Strong climate regulations from the Biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to Biden\u2019s goal of cutting emissions 50% by 2030. The bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more American consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Lawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what\u2019s needed to combat the climate crisis. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the laws of politics, this is about the laws of physics,\u201d Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told CNN. \u201cWe all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do.\u201d The bill would empower Medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors\u2019 offices or purchased at the pharmacy. The Health and Human Services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026, and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028. The number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond. This controversial provision is far more limited than the one House Democratic leaders have backed in the past. But it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing Medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs. Democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for Obamacare coverage through 2025, a year later than lawmakers recently discussed. That way they wouldn\u2019t expire just after the 2024 presidential election. To boost revenue, the bill would impose a 15% minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders, known as book income, as opposed to the Internal Revenue Service. The measure, which would raise $258 billion over a decade, would apply to companies with profits over $1 billion. Concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses, particularly manufacturers, Sinema has suggested that she won changes to the Democrats\u2019 plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes. The details remain unclear. However, Sinema nixed her party\u2019s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole, which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20% long-term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37%. The provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers\u2019 profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate. Addressing this loophole, which would have raised $14 billion over a decade, had been a longtime goal of congressional Democrats. In its place, a 1% excise tax on companies\u2019 stock buybacks was added, raising another $74 billion, according to a Democratic aide.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden vowed Friday to take \u201cstrong executive action\u201d in response to moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin torpedoing his party\u2019s efforts toward writing sweeping climate action and tax legislation. \u201cIf the Senate will not move to tackle the climate crisis and strengthen our domestic clean energy industry, I will take strong executive action to meet this moment,\u201d Biden said in statement, while overseas in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Biden didn\u2019t mention Manchin specifically. The President vowed to \u201ccreate jobs, improve our energy security, bolster domestic manufacturing and supply chains, protect us from oil and gas price hikes in the future, and address climate change,\u201d but did not provide specifics on what kind of action he would take. On Thursday night, Manchin dealt a devastating blow to Democrats\u2019 hopes for sweeping legislative action this year, telling Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and his staff \u201cunequivocally\u201d that he won\u2019t support the climate or tax provisions of a Democratic economic package, two sources familiar with the talks told CNN. Manchin and Schumer had been negotiating for months, and the New York Democrat had made a number of concessions to pare back the climate provisions to appease the West Virginia moderate, whose support is critical in an evenly decided Senate. In a Friday radio interview, Manchin disputed the characterization that he had blown up the negotiations with Schumer but said that he asked that they wait until the July inflation numbers came out and pursue this after August recess. \u201cI said, \u2018Chuck until we see the July inflation figures, until we see the July, basically Federal Reserve rates, interest rates, then let\u2019s wait till that comes out so we know that we\u2019re going down a path that won\u2019t be inflammatory, to add more to inflation,\u2019 \u201d Manchin told Hoppy Kercheval on Talkline. \u201cHe says, \u2018Are you telling me you won\u2019t do the other right now?\u2019 I said, \u2018Chuck, it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s not prudent to do the other right now.\u2019 \u201c CNN reported Thursday night that Manchin is open to letting Medicare negotiate prescription drug prices and to extending enhanced Affordable Care Act subsidies for two years, one of the sources said, which suggests that\u2019s all Democrats are likely to get in the package. In his statement, Biden did call on Congress to \u201cgive Medicare the power to negotiate lower drug prices and to prevent an increase in health insurance premiums for millions of families with coverage under the Affordable Care Act\u201d and urged lawmakers to \u201cpass it before the August recess\u201d and send it to his desk for a signature. Biden thanked Schumer, who took a lead role in the negotiations with Manchin, noting that he offered \u201csignificant compromises\u201d as he sought to broker a deal. \u201cI want to thank Leader Schumer for his dogged and determined effort to produce the strongest possible bill to bring down costs, reduce the deficit, and combat the climate crisis while boosting our energy security \u2013 even offering significant compromises to try to reach an agreement,\u201d Biden wrote. It\u2019s unclear if Manchin\u2019s public position asking that negotiators wait until September to consider raising taxes or climate provisions means that prescription drug pricing changes and ACA subsidies would be separate. Democrats have pushed to finish a deal before August recess in order to give their vulnerable members of for reelection a chance to campaign on the legislation. John Podesta, Center for American Progress founder and Obama climate adviser, expressed skepticism about Manchin\u2019s push for more time to consider the deal. \u201cI think that string has run out,\u201d Podesta said in an interview. \u201cHe killed this, and he has to own that. If he\u2019s happy about the consequences of that, so be it, but it\u2019s going to be devastating to a lot of people across the country.\u201d Manchin, who has cited increased federal spending as a main driver of inflation, would not budge on other Democratic priorities, and he told Schumer that he will not consider raising taxes on the wealthy or corporations. The change in tone of the latest negotiations was abrupt. Manchin had supported those provisions throughout the negotiations with the majority leader, both at the staff and member level, one of the sources familiar said. News of Manchin\u2019s stance of not supporting climate and tax provisions to Democratic leadership, first reported by The Washington Post, was met with outrage from climate activists and many fellow Democrats, who have previously seethed over Manchin\u2019s refusal to back some of the party\u2019s more ambitious spending proposals. In December, Manchin had torpedoed a $1.75 trillion version of Biden\u2019s climate and economic bill, known as the Build Back Better Act, angering the White House and Democrats who had pushed for a much larger $3.5 trillion spending plan at the beginning of the Biden administration. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sugar coat my disappointment here, especially since nearly all issues in the climate and energy space had been resolved,\u201d Senate Finance Chair Ron Wyden, whose committee had jurisdiction over the clean energy tax credits and corporate tax provisions, said in a statement. \u201cThis is our last chance to prevent the most catastrophic\u2014and costly\u2014effects of climate change. We can\u2019t come back in another decade and forestall hundreds of billions\u2014if not trillions\u2014in economic damage and undo the inevitable human toll,\u201d the Oregon Democrat added. Fellow Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico questioned Manchin\u2019s chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. \u201cWe have an opportunity to address the climate crisis right now. Senator Manchin\u2019s refusal to act is infuriating. It makes me question why he\u2019s Chair of ENR,\u201d Heinrich tweeted. Similarly, climate advocates, many of whom were anticipating seeing climate and energy bill text soon, reacted on Thursday night with shock and outrage. \u201cThis is nothing short of a death sentence,\u201d Varshini Prakash, co-founder of youth climate group Sunrise Movement, said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s clear appealing to corporate obstructionists doesn\u2019t work, and it will cost us a generation of voters.\u201d \u201cThere truly aren\u2019t words for how appalled, outraged, and disappointed we are,\u201d Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president of government affairs at the League of Conservation Voters, said. Manchin\u2019s office pointed to rising inflation. \u201cPolitical headlines are of no value to the millions of Americans struggling to afford groceries and gas as inflation soars to 9.1%,\u201d Manchin spokeswoman Sam Runyon said in a statement. \u201cSenator Manchin believes it\u2019s time for leaders to put political agendas aside, reevaluate and adjust to the economic realities the country faces to avoid taking steps that add fuel to the inflation fire.\u201d Data released Wednesday showed that inflation surged to a new pandemic-era peak in June, with US consumer prices jumping by 9.1% year-over-year \u2013 the highest level in more than 40 years. From December: How months of talks between Biden and Manchin over Build Back Better broke down But Evergreen Action co-founder Jamal Raad told CNN that Manchin\u2019s argument about not spending more to avoid worsening inflation missed the mark when it came to energy and climate. \u201cHe\u2019s not even about solving inflation because the major driver of inflation was gas prices, and he decided we should invest more in fossil fuels,\u201d Raad said. Democrats are now pushing to get the Affordable Care Act subsidies extended before the August recess to avoid major rate hikes that will be announced just before the midterm elections in November. The subsidies were expanded as part of the Democrats\u2019 American Rescue Plan Act and made coverage on the Obamacare exchanges more affordable, leading to record enrollment this year. If they are allowed to expire at the end of the year, nearly all of the 13 million subsidized enrollees will see their premiums rise for 2023, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than 3 million people could become uninsured, an Urban Institute analysis found. Democrats are hoping to avoid the negative publicity of such premium increases. If Congress doesn\u2019t act, consumers will learn in the fall just how much more they could have to pay. Open enrollment begins on November 1, a week ahead of Election Day.

            "article_content": "A contentious House primary in Oregon is dividing national and local Democrats as Rep. Kurt Schrader, running now in a district where more than half of primary voters are seeing his name on the ballot for the first time, faces a challenge on Tuesday from progressive Jamie McLeod-Skinner. Schrader has often angered party progressives during his seven terms in the House. But it wasn\u2019t until the state redistricting process produced a new map last year, which significantly altered the boundaries of his 5th Congressional District, that the conditions for a serious primary challenge first emerged. The race has attracted a barrage of outside spending, with more than $2 million alone coming from a pair of super PACs backing Schrader\u2019s reelection bid. Schrader also has the support of President Joe Biden, who made the incumbent his first endorsement of the cycle, and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party\u2019s House campaign arm. McLeod-Skinner has received a relatively modest boost from progressive outside groups, led by the Working Families Party. But, in a more ominous development for Schrader, she has also been endorsed by four Democratic county chapters across the new district. Three of the local parties took the unusual step of publicly demanding the DCCC stay out of the race. In April, the chairs of the Deschutes, Clackamas and Marion County Democrats wrote a letter condemning the DCCC\u2019s involvement \u2013 including, they noted, the funding of a campaign staffer for Schrader and efforts to recruit volunteers for his campaign \u2013 and asked the organization to \u201ccease your active support of Kurt Schrader during the primary election.\u201d \u201cAllow Oregonians to choose who represents us in Congress,\u201d they wrote. DCCC spokesperson Johanna Warshaw defended the organization, telling CNN that its \u201ccore mission is to re-elect Democratic members like Congressman Schrader, who has been critical in advancing President Biden\u2019s agenda \u2013 from fighting to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs to protecting a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d The backlash, and Schrader\u2019s opposition to key pieces of the President\u2019s legislative agenda, did not dissuade Biden from offering his support. \u201cWe don\u2019t always agree, but when it has mattered most, Kurt has been there for me,\u201d Biden said in the April 23 announcement. Schrader and his campaign have also argued that he is best positioned to win in what is expected to be a tight general election in the swing central Oregon district. \u201cThe reason why he has won this competitive district time and time again is because he can bring everyone together \u2013 rural, urban and suburban \u2013 to find common ground and deliver wins that make a real difference in the lives of all Oregonians,\u201d Schrader campaign spokesperson Deb Barnes told CNN. McLeod-Skinner lost a House race in the 2nd Congressional District to since-retired Republican Rep. Greg Walden in 2018 \u2013 though she outperformed expectations and did especially well in a chunk of the district that now rests in the new 5th \u2013 before finishing third in the 2020 Democratic primary for secretary of state. \u201cWe all want to win the general. I would not be in this race if I had not done my homework and was not convinced I could win the general,\u201d McLeod-Skinner said. And the rush of support from Washington, she told CNN in an interview, should be viewed as evidence of Schrader\u2019s weakness at home and a disconnect between national leadership and the politics of the district. \u201cThis may be a DC formula that is part of the reason why Democrats are hemorrhaging voters \u2013 there\u2019s not an understanding of relationship building,\u201d McLeod-Skinner said. \u201cThis sense you can just throw money into it and then voters will be led around by their nose, I think, is incredibly disrespectful of voters and a lack of understanding of relationships.\u201d McLeod-Skinner also took aim at Schrader over his votes against the American Rescue Plan, Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid relief package, and a measure in Biden\u2019s Build Back Better package to allow the government to negotiate the price of pharmaceutical drugs, which would dramatically lower prices. Schrader pushed an alternative provision and ultimately voted for full bill, but not before joining a group of nine moderates in an effort to decouple it from the bipartisan infrastructure bill \u2013 a tactical step that ultimately helped doom Build Back Better, Biden\u2019s would-be signature legislation \u2013 in the Senate. \u201cFolks across the political spectrum don\u2019t wanna be priced gouged on their prescription drugs. That\u2019s a no-brainer,\u201d McLeod-Skinner said. \u201cAnd Kurt\u2019s very much seen as having personally gotten in the way of that, no matter how many shiny flyers big pharma sends.\u201d Schrader\u2019s popularity with pharmaceutical donors has often been the center of progressive criticism of his work in Congress. Center Forward, which has spent more than $1 million backing him, and has received big bucks from the drug industry, which has given heavily to Schrader\u2019s campaigns. Asked about his vote against allowing prescription drug negotiations, Barnes, Schrader\u2019s spokesperson, pointed to his eventual support for Build Back Better in the House. \u201cHe has been a partner to the Biden administration, helping to pass the Build Back Better Act that allows Medicare to negotiate prescription prices and cap the cost of insulin,\u201d Barnes said.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s becoming the MAGA midterms \u2013 with or without former President Donald Trump. Sixteen months after leaving office, he\u2019s unquestionably still the figurehead of the red-hatted \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d brigades, but talented messengers running in this year\u2019s midterm elections have sometimes been more effective in articulating that brand and where it is headed. Trump is now facing a fresh test: not only whether he can vault his endorsed primary candidates to victory, but also whether he can maintain control of the movement he started as some candidates he spurned are claiming the MAGA label anyway and as his loyalists reject his chosen candidates. The former President is sprinkling primary endorsements like springtime blossoms as he seeks to prove his power before a possible 2024 White House race. Rival Republican candidates are feuding over who truly epitomizes the \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantle regardless of who the former President has backed. And President Joe Biden, hounded by high inflation and gas prices setting daily records, is trying to transform the election from a referendum on him into one on the democracy-threatening extremism of \u201cMAGA king\u201d Trump. Trump's voice is still very much being heard The battle to define the next phase of the MAGA movement reflects the huge role the 45th President plays in US politics \u2013 one that is especially extraordinary since the twice-impeached former commander in chief lost after a single term and left office in disgrace after attempting to mount a coup. But even the Republicans who admit that he lost the 2020 election don\u2019t see his legacy as tarnished. And as the dominant figure in the GOP, he\u2019s shaping what increasingly looks like a likely Republican House majority next year into a political weapon by setting himself up as a puppet master for the party\u2019s top leader in the chamber, Kevin McCarthy of California. The House minority leader on Thursday was subpoenaed along with four other GOP lawmakers by the House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. The ex-President has backed winners in high-profile tests of his endorsement power in the Ohio Senate race and the first incumbent vs. incumbent House matchup of the year, even while his candidate fell short in the Nebraska gubernatorial primary. But those early congressional primaries and rumblings of the 2024 presidential campaign are also elevating a corps of younger, radical candidates who are laying claim to the MAGA creed themselves, even without Trump\u2019s endorsement, and are raising the question whether the movement that Trump invented is beginning to run out of his control. 'Nervous about Oz's prospects': Trump and his allies worry about a Barnette victory in Pennsylvania This is most notably the case in Pennsylvania, where GOP Senate candidate Kathy Barnette has emerged as a major threat to Trump-backed Mehmet Oz and another top candidate, former hedge fund executive David McCormick, who has transformed himself from a conventional establishment Republican into a rabble-rousing acolyte of Trump \u2013 even without the ex-President\u2019s endorsement. And in Florida, GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis has taken Trump\u2019s tactics to the next level by enacting a MAGA-like agenda. While Trump\u2019s rally speeches center on his grievances about the 2020 election, DeSantis has used the unbridled power of the governor\u2019s office to pillory the \u201cwoke\u201d left and the press. He has targeted LGBTQ rights under the guise of \u201cparental rights.\u201d And he has built a national following and gigantic war chest by taking on liberals who he says are seeking to erase America\u2019s cultural heritage and traditional values. Meanwhile, some of Trump\u2019s handpicked candidates \u2013 like J.D. Vance, Ohio\u2019s newly minted GOP Senate nominee \u2013 have been able to frame the populist and nationalist goals of the MAGA movement more succinctly than the former President. At a Trump rally in Pennsylvania for Oz last week, for example, Vance drew an enthusiastic response from the crowd as he described the movement as a struggle between \u201cthe people\u201d and establishment Republicans, who he said would ship American jobs overseas and start \u201cstupid wars that we have no business fighting.\u201d Vance, once a harsh critic of Trump who used his endorsement to secure the GOP nod, called the midterms a \u201cwar for the soul of the Republican Party.\u201d And as Barnette, a conservative commentator, has touted her far-right credentials, she has bluntly said that \u201cMAGA does not belong to President Trump,\u201d hinting at the movement\u2019s future beyond the former President. How Trump's endorsement of Oz gave Kathy Barnette an unexpected opening in Pennsylvania \u201cAlthough he coined the word, MAGA actually belongs to the people,\u201d she said at a recent debate. \u201cOur values never, never shifted to President Trump\u2019s values. It was President Trump who shifted and aligned with our values.\u201d Republican operatives in the Keystone State are scrambling to stop Barnette, believing she\u2019s untested and unvetted \u2013 after a series of inflammatory past statements \u2013 and could hand a seat to Democrats in the fall that could determine which party controls the US Senate. Trump, who hates to be upstaged, isn\u2019t taking kindly to Barnette\u2019s surge, which could damage his kingmaker status if she triumphs over Oz in the Pennsylvania Senate primary on Tuesday. \u201cKathy Barnette will never be able to win the General Election against the Radical Left Democrats,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Thursday. \u201cShe has many things in her past which have not been properly explained or vetted,\u201d he said \u2013 a comment that seemed a bit rich given the considerable skeletons in the cupboard he overcame to become President. But, characteristically, Trump left himself a way out and a possible avenue to coopting her success if she wins, saying that if Barnette can clear up questions about her past, \u201cshe will have a wonderful future in the Republican Party\u2014and I will be behind her all the way.\u201d Still, Trump ended his statement by reaffirming his support for Oz, whose fame and television stardom seem to have been largely behind an endorsement of a candidate Republican purists argue is not a true conservative. \u201cDr. Oz is the only one who will be able to easily defeat the Crazed, Lunatic Democrat in Pennsylvania. A vote for anyone else in the Primary is a vote against Victory in the Fall!\u201d Trump wrote. While the former President\u2019s endorsement was widely credited with lifting Vance clear of the pack in Ohio, the idea that he simply barks orders and his followers jump is a caricature. In Georgia, for instance, Trump is highly popular among Republicans, but his effort to replace GOP Gov. Brian Kemp \u2013 who refused to sign up to his election-stealing scheme \u2013 with a handpicked candidate in ex-Sen. David Perdue appears to be backfiring. \u201cPeople love Trump, but Kemp will win,\u201d said Josh Brown, a 39-year-old from Rockmart, Georgia, on Thursday. Another voter, Jim Mayer, 65, of Rome, added: \u201cThe Trump endorsement means a lot, but I\u2019ve followed Kemp a long time.\u201d Audrey Burch, 55, also of Rome, is undecided between Kemp and Perdue. She faults Kemp for not doing more to address Trump\u2019s concerns about the 2020 election, but she lamented that she hasn\u2019t seen Perdue out there campaigning. \u201cI hope he\u2019s not planning on winning just because he\u2019s associating himself with Trump,\u201d she said. The rise of MAGA candidates who are in some cases more extreme than Trump is raising the stakes for Democrats who may end up opposing them. Some voters who crowded into a bar in the southeastern Pennsylvania city of York on Thursday to see Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the front-runner for the Democratic Senate nod, are watching the GOP primaries with alarm. But York resident Angela Stever predicted that a radical MAGA Republican nominee would drive Democrats to the polls. \u201cThey are loud, they make a lot of noise, but we come out when it matters. Democrats always come out when it matters,\u201d she said. And after months in which Democrats have struggled to find a message, Biden has recently gone on offense to present the midterms as a choice between his agenda and what he now calls \u201cultra-MAGA\u201d Republicans. Did Rick Scott just hand Democrats an *actual* message? He\u2019s also warned about the potential human costs of Florida Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s 11-point plan, which would require all Americans to pay some form of income tax and could create an opening for cuts to Social Security and Medicare by sunsetting the programs every five years. Though Scott\u2019s plan has been rejected by many Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Biden charged that the GOP does not \u201cwant to solve inflation by lowering the costs; they want to solve it by raising taxes and lowering your income.\u201d But there\u2019s no guarantee that running a fierce anti-Trump campaign will mitigate expected Democratic losses when Trump is not on the ticket. Last November, Biden, former President Barack Obama and Virginia Democrat Terry McAuliffe tried to turn that state\u2019s gubernatorial race into a referendum on Trump. But Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin carved out a narrow victory in a state Biden had won by 10 points the year before by addressing parents\u2019 concerns about education. That kind of model may not work everywhere since Youngkin, whose corporate image played well in the moderate Washington, DC, suburbs, was able to keep the ex-President at arm\u2019s length. But it shows the risk that Biden is taking by going full anti-MAGA this early. The strategy behind Biden's new language about Republicans And headwinds against Biden and the Democrats are so strong this year, it\u2019s possible MAGA candidates could be lifted into office on a red wave. Such a scenario could transform the Senate GOP conference as older, more establishment Republicans retire and younger, more extreme senators, surfing the anti-elite uprising stirred by Trump, replace them. That dynamic has already surfaced in the House, where McCarthy has long struggled to keep MAGA firebrands like Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida in line as they have repeatedly distracted from the GOP\u2019s ability to drive a message. But with Trump so heavily involved in trying to pick winners and losers, the totality of the primary season will deliver a verdict not just on the power of the man, but also on the power of the movement and whether he controls the forces he unleashed. If there are any signs of weakness, increasingly prominent figures like DeSantis are circling, ready to swoop in and carry the MAGA flag at a moment\u2019s notice.

            "article_content": "For weeks \u2013 months even \u2013 the refrain from Democrats, privately and then increasingly publicly, was that the party was message-less, unable to find a clear and concise argument to bring to the American public ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cDemocrats wrestle with what message to take into the midterms,\u201d The Washington Post wrote in February. \u201cDemocrats still divided over midterm messaging,\u201d read a headline from Roll Call in March. \u201cAfter Build Back Better\u2019s collapse, Democrats still struggling with how to message the midterms,\u201d CNN reported in April. You get the idea. Hopes were once high that Democratic majorities in the House and Senate would pass President Joe Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d plan \u2013 a sweeping (and expensive) proposal that cut across almost every domestic concern. When Build Back Better went off the rails \u2013 after West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said he couldn\u2019t support it in late 2021 \u2013 Democrats found themselves in a weird spot. They had passed a coronavirus relief bill. And an infrastructure package. And yet voters either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care. Biden and his party were dead in the water. Then Republicans gave them a gift. Or, to be more specific, Florida Sen. Rick Scott gave them a gift \u2013 in the form of an 11-point plan that he said he would push to advance if Republicans retook the majority. Among its proposals are sunsetting Medicare and Social Security and imposing an income tax on all Americans. Democrats, desperate to avoid a political cataclysm this fall, have seized on Scott\u2019s plan like Rose on that debris from the sinking ship in \u201cTitanic.\u201d \u201cAmericans have a choice right now between two paths reflecting two very different sets of values,\u201d Biden said in a speech Tuesday that sought to draw a bright line between his administration\u2019s solutions for the country\u2019s problems and those offered by the Republicans, as illuminated in Scott\u2019s plan. \u201cThe MAGA Republicans are counting on you to be as frustrated by the pace of progress, which they\u2019ve done everything they can to slow down, that you will hand power over to them \u2026 so they can enact their extreme agenda,\u201d Biden added. Now, look. Simply saying \u201cDonald Trump\u201d and \u201cMAGA\u201d over and over again between now and November is no guarantee that Democrats won\u2019t get walloped at the ballot box. If history is any guide \u2013 and it usually is! \u2013 then Democrats are headed for a rough election, almost no matter what their message is. But we also know this about politics: Some message is better than no message. And a message aimed at casting your opponents as too extreme for the ideological middle of the country has worked before.

            "article_content": "Well, I guess the kidding around is pretty much over. In a blistering statement released Tuesday morning, Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott said this of President Joe Biden: \u201cLet\u2019s be honest here. Joe Biden is unwell. He\u2019s unfit for office. He\u2019s incoherent, incapacitated and confused. He doesn\u2019t know where he is half the time. He\u2019s incapable of leading and he\u2019s incapable of carrying out his duties. Period. Everyone knows it. No one is willing to say it. But we have to, for the sake of the country. Joe Biden can\u2019t do the job.\u201d This unproven notion \u2013 that Biden is somehow enfeebled \u2013 has been kicking around conservative media and Trump-allied circles for some time now. The evidence usually revolves around clips of Biden misspeaking or stumbling over his words \u2013 and the fact that, at age 79, he is the oldest person ever to serve as president. Let\u2019s take a step back here to understand why Scott went absolutely nuclear on Biden. He went on to say in the same statement that Biden needs to resign for the good of the country. Back in February, Scott, who is the chairman of Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, released an 11-point plan designed \u201cto rescue America.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cIf Republicans return to Washington\u2019s business as usual, if we have no bigger plan than to be a speed bump on the road to America\u2019s collapse, we don\u2019t deserve to govern,\u201d he wrote of the plan. Among its many proposals were requiring all Americans to pay some income tax \u2013 roughly half of Americans do not pay taxes because their taxable income doesn\u2019t meet a minimum threshold \u2013 and to sunset programs like Social Security and Medicare unless Congress re-approves them. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made clear that a) he did not authorize Scott\u2019s plan b) he did not think it was good politics and c) he had no plans to implement pieces of it if Republicans retook the Senate majority this fall. \u201cLet me tell you what would not be a part of our agenda,\u201d McConnell said soon after the release of Scott\u2019s plan. \u201cWe will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years.\u201d What McConnell clearly feared was that Scott had handed Democrats a way to make the election about something other than their full control of Congress and the White House. It gave Democrats a target to shoot at \u2013 which they promptly did. Biden, struggling in polls and clearly concerned about the possibility of losing the House and Senate this fall, has aggressively seized on Scott\u2019s plan as a way to suggest that putting Republicans in charge of Congress would be lead to extremism. During a speech Tuesday focused on inflation, Biden criticized the \u201cultra-MAGA agenda\u201d Scott proposed. Asked by a reporter about Scott\u2019s resignation call, Biden responded: \u201cI think the man has a problem.\u201d Scott\u2019s statement may seem over the top \u2013 I mean, McConnell basically warned Democrats would do exactly what they are trying to do with his plan! \u2013 but you have to consider his audience. Scott seems like he wants to run for president \u2013 maybe as soon as 2024 \u2013 and he knows that chatter about Biden\u2019s mental capacity has been populating the likes of Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s Instagram feed for months and months now. Why not throw himself into that crowd? Scott likely relished being in a perceived one-on-one fight with the sitting Democratic President and knows that there is literally nothing at all that he can say about Biden that would be seen as taking things too far by the MAGA crowd. Now, is it a good thing for our democracy to have a Republican senator publicly suggesting that the President is \u201cincoherent, incapacitated and confused\u201d? Um, no. Does Scott care about that? Also no. This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge\u2019s rejection of the Biden mask mandate for public transportation \u2013 immediately unsettling life for Americans in the air and on the ground \u2013 reflects views that already have emerged on today\u2019s Supreme Court. Conservative justices have been ruling against Covid-19 measures since the start of the pandemic, including in January as the majority invalidated a vaccine requirement for large companies and, last summer, when it struck down a moratorium on evictions. No high court rulings have involved a federal mask requirement, as Monday\u2019s case did, but they have echoed similar distrust for governmental responses to the pandemic. CDC mask mandate for travelers no longer in effect following judge's ruling, official says \u201cThe Covid crisis has served as a sort of constitutional stress test and in doing so, it has highlighted disturbing trends that were already present before the virus struck,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said in a November 2020 Federalist Society speech. His assertion captured sentiment continually expressed in his opinions and those by fellow conservatives. The Supreme Court\u2019s vaccine and eviction-related decisions were cited throughout Florida US District Court Judge Kathryn Kimball Mizelle\u2019s decision that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exceeded statutory authority and violated procedures for new agency regulations when it first imposed the mask mandate last year. The high court has demonstrated skepticism for an array of anti-Covid restrictions, even beyond federal agency requirements. In 2020, it spurned time extensions for mail-in ballots during the presidential election season and lifted capacity requirements at churches and synagogues. The justices sounded impatient with restrictions at the outset. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a 2020 election case from Wisconsin, as he concurred in the rejection of a new absentee-ballot deadline, \u201cWhy did the district court seek to scuttle such long-settled tradition in this area? COVID. Because of the current pandemic, the court suggested, it was free to substitute its own election deadline for the State\u2019s.\u201d Conservative justices similarly derided the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) vaccine requirement for intruding on daily life and liberties. Throughout her 59-page opinion, Mizelle, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, the longest-serving member of the current high court, and its most conservative, echoed the skepticism from the high court\u2019s right wing for government\u2019s assertions of pandemic urgency. Samuel Alito's viral speech signals where conservative Supreme Court is headed \u201cOur system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of desirable ends,\u201d Mizelle wrote, quoting the high court\u2019s ruling against the federal eviction moratorium. She cited recent high court precedent as she found that the CDC overstepped its statutory authority and failed to abide by the Administrative Procedure Act, which requires public notice and time for comment before new rules take effect. This Supreme Court majority is readier to reject federal regulations across the board than predecessor courts. That pattern, and the sheer politics of mask mandates today, could influence whether the Biden administration decides to appeal, even as it believes it has a solid justification for the pandemic measure. The Department of Justice was still studying the decision on Tuesday and had not yet revealed its next move. The rule was to remain in place only through May 3, and the initial public responses suggest many people were ready to shed their masks. Most major airlines immediately said masks would be optional on their flights. Andy Slavitt, an acting chief of Medicare and Medicaid in the Obama administration and a former senior adviser to President Joe Biden on Covid-19, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins the court ruling presented a dilemma. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky question because on the one hand, you want to appeal a bad ruling. On the other hand, if they appeal and lose, they put themselves in a position where \u2013 let\u2019s say, in the winter or the late fall we have a really bad wave \u2013 they could put themselves in a position where they\u2019re not able to require masks at a point where they really need it.\u201d Slavitt noted that if Mizelle\u2019s reasoning were adopted up a chain of appeals the administration might lose the opportunity \u201cto put a mandate back under more trying circumstances.\u201d The Supreme Court has on a few occasions permitted Covid-19 regulations to stand, as in January when a six-justice majority upheld a vaccine mandate specifically imposed on workers at hospitals and other places that receive Medicare and Medicaid funding. Mizelle contrasted that Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) vaccine rule to the disputed CDC mask mandate, saying CMS \u201cprovided almost four pages of reasoning (with forty footnotes of supporting sources) on why there was good cause to forego notice and comment,\u201d compared to the \u201cterse\u201d explanation accompanying the mask mandate. She noted that the high court had found that the extensive CMS reasons justified a \u201cgood cause\u201d exception to the notice-and-comment dictate. In the original order that took effect on February 1, 2021, the CDC stressed that \u201ctraveling on multi-person conveyances increases a person\u2019s risk of getting and spreading COVID-19.\u201d It said masking would help stop the pandemic and build public confidence in travel and the re-opening of America\u2019s economy. Last week when Biden officials extended the mandate originally imposed in February 2021, they said it was needed because of the distinct risks of travel, in closed settings for prolonged periods, and because of rising Covid-19 cases. Mizelle\u2019s decision Monday focused on the original order. \u201cAt the time when the CDC issued the Mandate, the COVID-19 pandemic had been ongoing for almost a year and COVID-19 cases were decreasing,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis timing undercut the CDC\u2019s suggestion that its action was so urgent that a thirty-day comment period was contrary to the public interest. \u2026 The history suggests that the CDC itself did not find the passage of time particularly serious.\u201d See airline passengers throw away masks as mandate is revoked Her decision recalled sentiment voiced by justices in prior cases, including an opinion of Gorsuch, Thomas and Alito as they explained why they found last January that OSHA had exceeded its statutory authority when it imposed vaccine requirement on large employers. \u201cApproximately two years have passed since this pandemic began; vaccines have been available for more than a year,\u201d Gorsuch wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Thomas and Alito. \u201cOver that span, Congress has adopted several major pieces of legislation aimed at combatting COVID-19. \u201cThe question before us,\u201d they asserted, \u201cis not how to respond to the pandemic, but who holds the power to do so. The answer is clear: Under the law as it stands today, that power rests with the States and Congress.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. President Joe Biden on Wednesday signed a new law that will overhaul the US Postal Service\u2019s finances and allow the agency to modernize its service. The Postal Service Reform Act, which enjoyed a rare wave of bipartisan support in the House and Senate, bolsters an agency that is \u201cas essential as it ever was,\u201d the President said before signing the legislation. \u201cToday, we enshrine in law our recognition that the Postal Service is fundamental,\u201d Biden said. But what exactly is in the law, and how will it affect most Americans? Here\u2019s what you need to know: The Postal Service Reform Act will require retired postal employees to enroll in Medicare when eligible, while dropping a previous mandate that forced the agency to cover its health care costs years in advance. Those two measures would save the USPS nearly $50 billion over the next decade, according to the House Oversight Committee. The legislation will also require the USPS to create an online dashboard with local and national delivery time data. Established in 1775 to promote the free exchange of ideas across the colonies, the Postal Service is among the country\u2019s oldest government institutions \u2013 yet it operates with few of the financial benefits of being a federal agency while still bearing many of the costs. Unlike other government agencies, the USPS generally does not receive taxpayer funding, and instead must rely on revenue from stamps and package deliveries to support itself. And unlike private courier services such as UPS and FedEx, the USPS cannot excise unprofitable routes because Congress stipulates that the Postal Service delivers to all homes in America \u2013 including a remote community in the Grand Canyon, where the mail is delivered by mule. And Postal Service pricing must be approved by the Postal Regulatory Commission, an independent government agency. Most recently, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said that USPS\u2019 \u201cdire financial condition\u201d has inhibited the service from modernizing, including from replacing the vast majority of its aging vehicle fleet with electric trucks. DeJoy said last year that longer first-class mail delivery times and cuts to post office hours across the country are among the changes in his 10-year plan for the agency. While lawmakers from both parties have hailed the legislation as an important step for the USPS, Paul Steidler, a postal service expert at the Lexington Institute, told CNN it doesn\u2019t go nearly far enough. \u201cThe bill is woefully insufficient because it does nothing to improve mail service. It takes the pressure off of the Postal Service to better understand and to reduce its costs. And it doesn\u2019t sufficiently empower the Postal Regulatory Commission, which right now is very small and has very tiny resources compared to the Postal Service.\u201d \u201cThis legislation is not going to affect that in any way, positively or negatively,\u201d Steidler told CNN. Millions of Americans voted by mail in 2020, despite then-President Donald Trump\u2019s constant attacks on the process. Comprehensive studies of billions of ballots cast over many years indicate that the rate of voter fraud is less than 0.0001%, and Americans are likely to continue voting by mail in future elections. \u201cThey did a great job in the 2020 election in terms of getting things delivered on time. And so there\u2019s every reason to expect that that\u2019s going to continue this year in 2022,\u201d Steidler said, noting that election mail \u201cis a very small fraction of the total amount of mail that the postal service handles.\u201d \u201cBecause almost all Americans still rely on it at different times for important business correspondence, legal correspondence, notices from government, including the IRS, Department of Motor Vehicles,\u201d Steidler said. \u201cThe US Postal Service is the only organization that can deliver the mail.\u201d \u201cMail remains very important. It is especially important for those in rural communities, for the poor, for those who are disabled, and the numbers speak for themselves.\u201d CORRECTION: The story has been corrected to specify that US Postal Service prices are approved and overseen by the Postal Regulatory Commission.

Double especially when they are both in that party\u2019s leadership. But that\u2019s exactly what happened on Tuesday as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell completely dismissed Florida Sen. Rick Scott\u2019s 11-point plan to \u201crescue America.\u201d Scott, the head of Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign committee, released the proposal last week. \u201cIf we\u2019re fortunate enough to have the majority next year, I\u2019ll be the majority leader, I\u2019ll decide in consultation with my members what to put on the floor,\u201d McConnell said when asked about Scott\u2019s plan at a news conference. Scott\u2019s plan would, among other things, require all Americans to pay income taxes and sunset all government programs \u2013 including Social Security and Medicare \u2013 within five years. (Under Scott\u2019s proposal, Congress would have to reapprove federal legislation every five years.) \u201cWe will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people, and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years,\u201d McConnell added. \u201cThat will not be a part of the Republican Senate majority agenda.\u201d Jake Sherman, a founding editor of Punchbowl News, a Congress-focused news service, tweeted that \u201cthe McConnell-Rick Scott episode is about as bad as I\u2019ve seen an intra-leadership feud in a while.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! McConnell has consistently opposed Republicans offering their own policy agenda ahead of the November midterm elections, insisting that the path to victory lies in making the election a referendum on President Joe Biden and the Democrats who control both chambers of Congress. When asked in January what the GOP\u2019s agenda would be if it took control of Congress, McConnell told reporters: \u201cThat is a very good question and I\u2019ll let you know when we take it back.\u201d Despite McConnell\u2019s stated opposition, Scott decided to release a detailed plan for what Republicans would pledge to do if they retook the Senate majority. Following McConnell\u2019s remarks Tuesday, Scott said he would continue to talk about his plan. \u201cI agree with Senator McConnell that this election will primarily be about Joe Biden and the Democrats\u2019 failures, but have been clear that I also believe Republicans should talk about a plan for turning this country around,\u201d Scott said. Why did Scott do it? Because while he, like McConnell, wants to win back the Senate majority in November, he, unlike McConnell, has national aspirations as a potential presidential contender in either 2024 or 2028. Scott\u2019s plan has to be seen through that lens; it reads like the start of a platform of someone who is running for president. And, in fact, McConnell\u2019s disdain for his plan may well play into Scott\u2019s hands as he tries to position himself as an outsider \u2013 despite being in Republican leadership. \u201cLike the \u2018Contract with America\u2019 before it, the Washington insiders will hate this plan,\u201d Scott wrote in his proposal. Well, Mitch McConnell certainly hates it.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are substantially tamping down their ambitions after failing to pass their top priorities, turning their attention to keeping the lights on and passing narrowly targeted legislation while scrambling to salvage aspects of their sprawling economic agenda. In the past month, Democrats failed to pass a $1.75 trillion bill strengthening the social safety net and a second bill expanding access to the ballot box across the country \u2013 unable to overcome the steadfast opposition of Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia in the 50-50 Senate. While the Democrats\u2019 bill to rewrite voting and elections laws is dead for the year after Senate Republicans blocked it on Wednesday night, and Senate Democrats failed to eliminate the filibuster that allows their opponents to stop it, they are now discussing targeted changes to make it harder to overturn a presidential election when a joint session of Congress meets to count electoral votes. Democratic leaders in Congress are now reduced to hoping that they can pass what President Joe Biden labeled as \u201cchunks\u201d of his Build Back Better bill. \u201cWe have negotiated for five months. It has failed miserably,\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Senate Budget Committee chairman, told CNN on Thursday. \u201cWe lost the enormously important vote last night and Build Back Better, which is enormously popular with the American people, it\u2019s what they want us to do, has also been sabotaged. I think it is time to move in a very different direction.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called \u201cchunks\u201d an \u201cinteresting word\u201d on Thursday that belies the importance of what they argue their legislation will do: expand child care, family care and health care and address climate change. \u201cIt may be more limited, but it is still significant,\u201d Pelosi said. Arizona Democrat says some senators urging him to challenge Sinema with party at a 'breaking point' But in a memo Friday, Pelosi acknowledged that the Build Back Better bill that consumed Congress for months \u2013 the bill at the center of Biden\u2019s economic agenda \u2013 will be put on the backburner while the House focuses on other matters. Pelosi said the House must pass a government spending bill by a February 18 deadline, and will consider other bills to ensure health benefits for veteran victims exposed to toxic substances in burn pits, to help Ukraine as Russia considers whether to invade it and to boost US competitiveness against China by investing in domestic semiconductor chip manufacturing. With their narrow majorities in both chambers at risk in the 2022 elections, Democrats will mostly tout their accomplishments last year \u2013 passing a $1.2 trillion infrastructure law with bipartisan support and a nearly $2 trillion Covid-19 relief plan enacted by only Democrats. \u201cDid we set expectations too high? We set expectations,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told CNN. \u201cHave we been able to accomplish all of them? No, but we\u2019ve accomplished a large amount of them.\u201d The upcoming legislative agenda put forward Friday for the House underscored the difficulties in trying to persuade all 50 Democratic senators, including Manchin, to agree on the wide-ranging Build Back Better bill. Manchin set a very high bar this week to passing a scaled-back version, saying that they are \u201cstarting from scratch\u201d and will need to deal with pressing national issues \u2013 like the pandemic, inflation and the federal debt \u2013 before addressing a cornerstone of the White House\u2019s agenda. He also said that Congress needs to fix the 1887 Electoral Count Act, which has come under scrutiny in the wake of last year\u2019s January 6 attack on the US Capitol. \u201cThe main thing we need to do is take care of the inflation,\u201d Manchin told CNN when asked about re-engaging in talks with the White House. \u201cGet your financial house in order. Get a tax code that works and take care of the pharmaceuticals that are gauging the people with high prices. We can fix that. We can do a lot of good things.\u201d 5 significant bills and 5 executive orders Biden signed in his first year -- and his 5 biggest priorities for 2022 Manchin said Thursday that he has yet to begin talks with Biden. He indicated that his last offer to the White House from December is not on the table anymore, saying that they will work from a \u201cclean sheet of paper.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t draw a redline on a dollar amount he would accept, only saying: \u201cI want to see what\u2019s feasible, what we can do in a reasonable, feasible way.\u201d Manchin also dismissed criticism from Democrats that he undermined the Biden agenda by coming out in opposition to the Build Back Better bill in December, saying he represents a different constituency than his colleagues. \u201cWe\u2019ve come from different areas,\u201d Manchin told CNN. \u201cOK. It\u2019s not just all urban, metropolitan areas. Those of us who come from rural areas, and there\u2019s a complete different constituency that we all serve.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not a Washington Democrat, so the base they have is a different base than I have,\u201d he added. Democrats may be forced to abandon key aspects of the Build Back Better plan even though they have wide support from the party, particularly an expansion of the child tax credit, funding for housing programs and an expansion of Medicare to include hearing coverage. Voting rights fight shifts back to statehouses as Senate Democrats fail to advance national protections But Democrats face other issues besides trying to figure out what Manchin will accept. As the White House discussed moving parts of the Build Back Better plan this week, familiar problems re-emerged, including from Democrats in high tax states that want to ease the limits Republicans imposed on deductions for state and local taxes during the Trump administration. Many Democrats said that making those changes would amount to a giveaway for the rich. But on Thursday a trio of House Democrats \u2013 Tom Suozzi of New York and Mikie Sherrill and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey \u2013 said in a statement that repealing the cap on the state and local tax deduction \u201cremains a top priority.\u201d \u201cWe support the President\u2019s agenda, and if there are any efforts that include a change in the tax code, then a SALT fix must be part of it,\u201d they wrote. \u201cNo SALT, no deal.\u201d",

Democrat Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick is the heavy favorite against Republican Jason Mariner in Tuesday\u2019s special election for Florida\u2019s 20th Congressional District, where President Joe Biden won 77% of the vote in 2020. As of Monday afternoon, about 37,000 Democrats had voted early or by mail, compared with 6,000 Republicans. One of two Black-majority seats in the state, the district has been vacant since Hastings\u2019 death last April, much to the ire of Florida Democrats, who accused Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of delaying the election to deprive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of critical votes in the narrowly divided chamber. \u201cThis is nothing short of voter suppression tactics and political gamesmanship,\u201d said Richard Hoye, chairman of the Broward County Democrats. Hoye said local Democrats remain confident they\u2019ll prevail Tuesday, but they are expecting turnout to be low. In May, when he announced the special election, DeSantis said he wanted to make sure candidates had enough time to mount a campaign. \u201d I know as someone who ran for (Congress), there\u2019s a lot that goes into it,\u201d DeSantis said at the time. Cherfilus-McCormick shocked Democrats in South Florida when she emerged victorious \u2013 by the slimmest of margins \u2013 in a hotly contested and crowded primary for the seat in November. She defeated the Hastings family\u2019s handpicked successor, Broward County Supervisor Dale Holness, by just five votes after a lengthy recount. If elected, Cherfilus-McCormick would become the first Hatian American Democrat in Congress. Cherfilus-McCormick, a businesswoman who had twice mounted primary challenges against Hastings, has pumped a staggering $5.9 million of her own money into the race. Mariner, meanwhile, had raised about $100,000 through mid-December, according to federal campaign finance reports. The two candidates represent the ideological wings of their respective parties. Cherfilus-McCormick has campaigned on progressive policies like \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and the \u201cPeople\u2019s Prosperity Plan\u201d to provide $1,000 monthly checks to Americans paid for with tax increases on the wealthy. Cherfilus-McCormick told CNN that the pandemic has led to more people embracing the idea of a universal basic income. \u201cThe election came after economic stimulus checks and after Covid arrived, and people realized that check, which went toward housing, food, electricity, bare necessities, that it actually gave them a break,\u201d she said. \u201cMore people are believing in that safety net while we\u2019re in the midst of economic instability.\u201d Mariner has criticized Cherfilus-McCormick\u2019s idea as expensive and implausible. He is a supporter of former President Donald Trump and an \u201cAmerica First\u201d Republican who lists election integrity and public safety among his top priorities on his campaign materials. His website also promotes his turnaround story. Mariner \u201cbeat drug addiction,\u201d the site says, to become a successful business owner. Mariner served time in prison after he was convicted of felony theft and drug charges, according to state Department of Corrections records. Mariner said he had received positive feedback for turning his life around before he ran for Congress, but it has since been used against him in what has become an increasingly acrimonious campaign in recent weeks. \u201cThe second I put an \u2018R\u2019 next to my name \u2026 I\u2019m drawn and quartered, proverbially,\u201d Mariner told CNN in an interview Monday. \u201cI said to somebody the other day, \u2018Take away the party affiliation and look at my work.\u2019 \u201c Mariner handily won his party\u2019s primary. His site lists endorsements from US Rep. Brian Mast, convicted Trump fixer Roger Stone and Laura Loomer, a failed congressional candidate and far-right provocateur banned by social media companies. The winner on Tuesday will face reelection later this year, though the district boundaries are subject to change once Florida lawmakers finalize the new congressional maps. Holness has already filed to run for the seat again in the regularly scheduled August primary.",

            "article_content": "The two visions of pandemic America have arrived at the US Supreme Court. To the Biden administration, this is a life-or-death moment. Administration lawyers defending a new workplace vaccination requirement highlight the human toll of the deadly virus, a collapsing health care system and the \u201cgrave danger\u201d of Covid-19 transmission among workers. Businesses and states that brought the lawsuits to be heard at the high court on Friday say the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine-or-test regulation for large employers would cause workers to quit and profits to plunge. The challengers stress the cost to the national economy and to individual liberty. All nine Supreme Court justices have received a Covid-19 booster shot The dueling assertions offer more than echoes of today\u2019s blue-and-red state politics. They reflect a key issue at this stage of the dispute over the authority of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to protect workers against the Covid-19 virus, now as the highly infectious Omicron variant rages. A key question for this rushed set of hearings is which side would be injured more if the vaccination requirement were imposed or, alternatively, blocked, while litigation on the full merits of the regulation proceeds. RELATED: The Supreme Court has upheld state and local vaccine mandates. That may not save Biden\u2019s. The disputes over OSHA\u2019s vaccine rule for companies with 100 or more workers will be heard along with separate fast-tracked challenges to a federal vaccine requirement for health care facilities serving Medicare and Medicaid patients. Laced into the written filings to the justices in the OSHA cases are clashing visions of how bad things are. The administration strikes an ominous tone, emphasizing the deadliest pandemic in the nation\u2019s history. The rules requiring vaccines or testing would save thousands of lives and would prevent hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations \u201cin the next six months alone.\u201d The Supreme Court has upheld state and local vaccine mandates. That may not save Biden's. The challengers try to avoid minimizing the Covid-19 death toll, instead stressing that people face risks from all the routines of life. Asserting that individual workers face disparate risks, some far from a \u201cgrave danger,\u201d the states write, \u201cAfter all, even many overwhelmingly safe substances, like peanut butter and latex, present an especially high risk to some subset of individuals.\u201d In the same vein, medical groups backing the administration focus on the 830,000 Americans already killed, while advocates on the other side raise doubts about the usefulness of vaccines and extol people who decline the shot, whether for religious, medical or other personal reasons. The nine justices come to this series of disputes over vaccination policy from their own vantage points. They were among the first eligible for shots when the vaccine became available, and the court said in March 2021 that all were \u201cfully vaccinated.\u201d Tuesday, the court said that all nine have received booster shots. At the court building, the justices have instituted mask and testing protocols. In the courtroom, law clerks, journalists and the other limited spectators wear high-grade N95 masks. Among the nine justices on the elevated bench, only Sonia Sotomayor, who has spoken openly about her diabetes, has so far worn a mask during court proceedings. The year Supreme Court conservatives made their mark But on the law, cases related to pandemic regulations have produced mixed results since the early months of 2020, when the justices reviewed mail-in ballot and other election-season precautions, as well as church and synagogue capacity restrictions. They have blocked several government health measures, most significantly a federal moratorium on evictions last August, but have let stand some state vaccine and mask requirements. In the decision against the eviction moratorium, the Supreme Court said that \u201cit strains credulity to believe\u201d that federal law gives the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u201cthe sweeping authority it asserts.\u201d The new OSHA standard, which the challengers say would cover 84 million workers, could trigger the anti-regulatory sentiment of the court majority, bolstered by three appointees of former President Donald Trump. The National Federation of Independent Business and other business and state challengers say Congress has not clearly authorized the power OSHA claims for vaccines and testing. They contend that the policy raises a \u201cmajor question\u201d of economic significance that should be left to Congress. The current Supreme Court's partisan moment rivals Bush v. Gore But Department of Justice lawyers, defending the Biden initiative, contend the OSHA standard flows directly from its statutory authority to protect workers from viruses that present \u201ca grave danger.\u201d They stress that the costs of blocking it could be \u201cenormous\u201d to people\u2019s health and workers would have options. Those who refuse to get fully vaccinated would be required to wear masks and show proof of  negative COVID-19 tests once a week. \u201c(I)n charging OSHA with protecting the safety and health of workers in all businesses that affect interstate commerce,\u201d US Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who will argue Friday, wrote, \u201cCongress already made the judgment that ensuring safe workplaces might require substantial regulations that apply nationwide and carry significant compliance costs. No clearer statement is necessary.\u201d The National Federation of Independent Business contends the OSHA rule \u201cattempts for the first time\u201d to cover a virus that\u2019s everywhere in daily life, not just on the job. A lower US appellate court that sided with the administration last month rejected the contention, saying that judges have upheld OSHA\u2019s authority to regulate hazards that extend into society but present a higher risk in the workplace. The business federation, which will be represented by lawyer Scott Keller on Friday, focuses on the costs to the national economy, arguing that unless the Supreme Court prevents the new standard from taking effect next Monday, America\u2019s businesses will immediately incur billions of dollars in compliance costs and lose workers. Avlon: Mandates work. We have the data to prove it \u201cThe OSHA requirement,\u201d Keller writes, \u201cwill irreparably injure the very businesses that Americans have counted on to widely distribute COVID-19 vaccines and protective equipment to save lives \u2013 and to keep them fed, clothed, and sustained during this now two-year-long pandemic.\u201d Officials from 27 states, who will be represented by Ohio Solicitor General Benjamin Flowers, opened their filing dramatically: \u201cCicero famously observed that, in times of war, the laws fall silent. Perhaps that was true of the Roman system. It is not true of ours.\u201d Invoking phrasing from the justices\u2019 ruling against the Biden administration moratorium on landlord evictions, Flowers added, \u201cIn \u2018our system,\u2019 the government may not \u2018act unlawfully\u2019 even in extraordinary times.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. The Cheney name has long been golden in Wyoming. Dick Cheney was elected six times to the state\u2019s only seat in the House, where he joined the Republican Party\u2019s leadership before becoming defense secretary and eventually vice president. And it was only two years ago that his daughter, Rep. Liz Cheney, won 68% of the vote as she cruised to victory for the third time. But in Tuesday\u2019s Republican primary, the ardent critic of former President Donald Trump\u2019s refusal to concede that he lost in 2020 suffered a crushing defeat of her own. The Trump-endorsed candidate in the race, Harriet Hageman, won 66% of the primary vote, compared to Cheney\u2019s 28.9%. The margin of defeat \u201cappears to be the second worst for a House incumbent in the last 60 years, when you look at races featuring only one incumbent,\u201d wrote CNN\u2019s Harry Enten. Could there be any stronger indication that the party\u2019s voter base is fiercely loyal to Trump? \u201cLiz Cheney made it clear in her barn burner of a concession speech that she is not planning to ride off quietly into the sunset,\u201d observed Arick Wierson and Bradley Honan. \u201cRather, she plans to \u2018do whatever it takes to ensure that Donald Trump is never again near the Oval Office, and I mean it.\u2019\u201d A Cheney run for the GOP nomination in 2024, though, \u201cwould likely be nothing more than a constant irritant\u201d to Trump supporters, Wierson and Honan argued. \u201cCheney\u2019s smartest move would be to join the Biden administration in a bespoke senior-level role where her mandate is clear: coordinate the fight for free and fair elections and wage all-out war against the anti-American and undemocratic forces that Trumpism has unleashed. Cheney is the ideal crusader in this fight.\u201d Rich Lowry, writing for Politico, observed that it \u201cwas an admirable loss. It is rare that any elected official is willing to sacrifice his or her office over a matter of deeply felt principle. Cheney did it unhesitatingly. She will be remembered fondly by history, and better than other members of her party who have repeated or tolerated lies merely to maintain or gain political power.\u201d But he argued that a Cheney campaign for president in 2024 would fail and could even help Trump\u2019s prospects. In the Washington Post, Jennifer Rubin took a different tack on the 2024 question, suggesting Cheney could achieve her goal if she is able to \u201cturn a partisan primary into a national crusade enlisting Republicans, Democrats and independents against Trump. It will take a unique primary strategy unlike anything we\u2019ve seen to remove a unique threat to our democracy.\u201d Marc A. Thiessen, also in the Post, wrote that the reason for Cheney\u2019s defeat was clear: \u201cCheney believes that Trump is the greatest threat facing our country today, greater than the serial disasters President Biden has unleashed since taking office \u2014 among them, the worst inflation in 40 years\u2026\u201d He added, \u201cThe vast majority of Republicans disagree.\u201d \u201cThe way to persuade GOP voters to move beyond Trump is not to attack him but to convince them that he is the candidate most likely to lose in 2024. Republican voters\u2019 top priority is to defeat Joe Biden. And that means no one wants to join Liz Cheney on her suicide run.\u201d For more: Nicole Hemmer: Is America ready for the return of Sarah Palin? On Tuesday, President Joe Biden signed the $750 billion bill Sen. Joe Manchin touted as the \u201cInflation Reduction Act.\u201d It has been hailed by climate activists for provisions that will speed up America\u2019s transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy and by health care advocates for enabling Medicare to negotiate the price of many commonly used prescription drugs. But have the bill\u2019s benefits been oversold? That\u2019s the view of economist Jeffrey D. Sachs. \u201cDespite its title, the new legislation will have essentially no effect on reducing inflation during the next few years. Today\u2019s inflation, running at 8.5% year-over-year in July, results from economy-wide imbalances of supply and demand. Even the small steps on drug pricing in the new law \u2013 allowing Medicare to negotiate the prices of some drugs as of 2026 \u2013 will have no effect on current inflation, and only tiny effects later.\u201d Sachs argued that the climate provisions will only deliver \u201cmodest results\u201d and that the bill falls far short of what progressives were seeking from the Biden administration: \u201cThe Dems abandoned earlier proposals for universal pre-kindergarten and subsidized child care, paid family and medical leave, free community college and expanded child tax credits, among other initiatives.\u201d Republicans have criticized the bill\u2019s big increase in funding for the Internal Revenue Service, Casey Michel noted. \u201cThe GOP has been trying for years to starve the IRS of revenue and resources, in the hope \u2013 to borrow a phrase from anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist \u2013 to make it small enough to drown in a bathtub.\u201d \u201cRepublicans have been making the scurrilous claim that the Biden administration aims to deploy a ramped-up \u2018army\u2019 of IRS agents to target middle-income workers and small businesses. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig \u2013 who was appointed by former President Donald Trump \u2013 said earlier this month that the agency will only be increasing audits of the wealthiest Americans.\u201d  Democrats have gotten a psychological boost from the bill\u2019s passage, but historian Julian Zelizer warned that \u201chistorically, legislative success rarely translates into electoral gains. \u2026the fact of the matter is that presidents who have achieved huge, legacy-making bills on Capitol Hill often suffer through miserable midterms. Voters don\u2019t often feel the benefits in the short term, and if the opposition frames the policies in an unflattering light, big bills can prompt a backlash.\u201d Still, he noted they should take heart from the struggles of some GOP Senate candidates in swing states, such as Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania. Oz tried to highlight the effects of inflation in a video he posted of himself shopping for ingredients to make \u201ccrudit\u00e9s,\u201d only to be lampooned by his challenger John Fetterman, whose campaign said it raised $500,000 after the Democrat tweeted, \u201cIn PA we call this a\u2026veggie tray.\u201d \u201cIt pays to be married,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic, commenting on new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, which was reported by the Wall Street Journal. Married couples are now worth nearly nine times as much as single households \u2013 a significant jump from 2010, when couples were worth four times as much. \u201cSome of this is just math: Households with two adults in them have more resources,\u201d she noted. \u201cThey will be able to split the cost of rent and groceries and more easily qualify for a mortgage or save for a down payment on a house.\u201d \u201cBut some of it is also about the privileges the US continues to bestow on married couples, and the ways in which our workplaces, norms and expectations have not significantly shifted since the era of the patriarchal nuclear family, with a dad out earning the bread and a mom at home raising children \u2013 even as our families and our lives have radically changed\u2026\u201d \u201cBeing married provides a slew of advantages, from tax breaks to Social Security benefits to health insurance.\u201d It was only after Jesse Lutgen\u2019s death four years ago that his mother found out he had been rationing doses of insulin after losing his full-time job and health insurance. Janelle Lutgen, a health care advocate and former chair of the Republican Central Committee in Jackson County, Iowa, pointed out that Jesse is one of at least 14 diabetic Americans to die as a result of rationing since 2017. \u201cWhat happened to my son, who felt like he had no choice but to ration his insulin, is happening all over America \u2013 because insulin is not affordable for most people who are uninsured. A month\u2019s supply can cost over $1,000 out-of-pocket, something I only learned after Jesse was gone\u2026\u201d \u201cWhile I am thankful for legislation that will do so much for some, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) falls short for most diabetics. It will cap insulin co-payments for Medicare beneficiaries but will not lower the list price of insulin. Instead, the high costs will be shifted elsewhere. \u201cAnd uninsured diabetics, like my late son, remain vulnerable. The IRA will have no impact on list prices paid by the uninsured.\u201d Controversy continued to swirl around the FBI\u2019s search at Mar-a-Lago for documents, including some highly classified ones, that were taken from the White House in the closing days of the Trump administration. On Thursday, a federal magistrate judge released more information on the potential offenses the Justice Department is investigating, including \u201cwillful retention of national defense information.\u201d FBI and Homeland Security officials have warned of a wave of \u201cviolent threats\u201d against federal law enforcement.  An armed man tried to enter the FBI\u2019s office in Cincinnati on August 11 and was later killed after he fled from the scene and exchanged gunfire with authorities in a standoff that lasted hours. Dean Obeidallah argued that GOP officials should be \u201ccondemning those who have contributed to an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 number of threats against the FBI \u2013 including the two agents who signed the search warrant \u2026 The silence of GOP leaders sends a message that they are angrier at the FBI for conducting a lawful search of Trump\u2019s property than with those making death threats against the bureau. In a post-January 6 America, GOP leaders have an even greater obligation to speak out loudly to denounce any violent acts or even threats from their supporters.\u201d Don\u2019t expect the legal issues over the Mar-a-Lago documents to be resolved soon, wrote Norman Eisen, Asha Rangappa and Dennis Aftergut. They noted that Attorney General Merrick Garland recently issued a memo instructing to Justice Department to avoid \u201cany actions that could be perceived as affecting an election before it takes place.\u201d Trump isn\u2019t on the ballot this fall but he \u201cremains one of the most polarizing characters in American politics, and any action taken could have an impact on the midterm elections.\u201d For more: Stephanie Grisham and Gavin J. Smith: We must put country first, not the former President Jodi Enda: Giuliani is in freefall While Covid-19 continues to take its toll, scientists are sharing their concerns about other diseases, some new, like the Langya virus in eastern China, and some old, like the possible recurrence of polio in the US. \u201cJust when you thought that 2022 already provided a century\u2019s worth of scary infectious diseases, from Covid-19 to monkeypox to polio, last week\u2019s headlines warned of yet another,\u201d wrote infectious disease expert Dr. Kent Sepkowitz. \u201cThe Langya virus may have jumped from the white-toothed shrew to humans. It has sickened dozens of people, but has caused no reported deaths. \u201cMany may wonder just what is going on here. Why are so many infections appearing so quickly? Several explanations are plausible: Perhaps a globally warmed and densely populated world is more hospitable to all sorts of new pathogens; perhaps new molecular techniques are allowing us only now to diagnose the cause of the endless unnamed sniffles, colds and rashes that previous generations could not name, creating a concrete \u2018outbreak,\u2019 not just a \u2018lousy winter.\u2019\u201d The most unnerving part is that even the experts have to admit they can\u2019t predict the future. Sepkowitz observed, \u201cAdjusting to news of yet another pathogen surely is unsettling and seeking guidance makes perfect sense. Perhaps though, we should receive the prediction not as an infallible collection of future facts but rather with the same mixture of wariness and hope that we would greet the prediction of a baseball expert who, in August, is tasked with predicting who will win the World Series in October.\u201d As epidemiologist Syra Madad wrote, the discovery of a polio vaccine in the 1950s was a huge triumph. \u201cChurch bells rang out across America and people flooded into the streets to celebrate with parents hugging their children in relief \u2026 The celebration was warranted; through vaccination, the US eliminated wild, or naturally occurring, poliovirus more than 40 years ago.\u201d But now, \u201cimmunization coverage is dropping worldwide, and the immunity wall generations past have built is slowly being chipped away. The vaccine distrust that unwarrantedly grew out of the Covid-19 pandemic is only driving more people to opt out of vaccinations or under-vaccinate themselves and their children. \u2026 Polio should have been a disease relegated to the pages in our history books. It is human behavior and the choices we make that prevent it from become another lasting public health success story.\u201d Rafia Zakaria: Let\u2019s honor Salman Rushdie by recommitting to free expression Sara Novic: FDA\u2019s new hearing aid rules help some but leave others behind W. Kamau Bell: The United States has broken this fundamental promise over 300 times Michael Bociurkiw: The Ukrainian war is also being fought over language AND\u2026 Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine has prompted thousands \u2013 and perhaps hundreds of thousands \u2013 of Russians to flee the country, noted Frida Ghitis. In China, where discontent over the zero-Covid policy has flared up, \u201cescaping from autocracy is becoming more and more attractive. In China, the term is \u2018run xue,\u2019 or \u2018run philosophy.\u2019 The expression \u2013 so far not blocked by Chinese web censors \u2013 is drawing intense interest online.\u201d Since Xi Jinping \u201ctook power in China in 2013, the number of asylum applications has grown nearly eight times, reaching nearly 120,000 last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency, with about 75% of asylum-seekers requesting to live in the United States. \u2026 Putin and Xi will continue to claim their systems are superior to democracy. They will point to the flaws, to the struggles of democratic systems, which certainly exist. But those who disagree with them at home, unable to speak out, will either keep quiet, keep their criticism to barely-audible whispers, or vote with their feet, heading toward freer lands.\u201d",

He is the author and editor of 24 books, including, \u201cThe Presidency of Donald J. Trump: A First Historical Assessment.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. With the passage of the CHIPS Act to boost US production of semiconductors and the announcement of a deal among Senate Democrats on a bill addressing climate change, health care and taxes, President Joe Biden is on the verge of a huge political victory. These bills offer the much-desired combination of major policy changes that also bring political benefit to the White House. Securing support for them was a long and difficult road. The dragged-out deliberations took place as the President\u2019s political standing fell precipitously, including with Democrats who argued that he had been too timid in confronting Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia over signature measures to deal with climate change and health care. While the Inflation Reduction Act that emerged from negotiations between Manchin and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is far from what was originally envisioned in Biden\u2019s Build Back Better bill, it would still have a powerful impact. Enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the pharmaceutical industry would save consumers a significant amount of money. Spending $369 billion to fight climate change by investing in clean energy and reducing greenhouse emissions is a huge step forward. \u201cIt really makes me incredibly optimistic. It doesn\u2019t get us all the way there on its own, but it keeps us in the climate fight,\u201d noted Jesse Jenkins, a climate expert at Princeton. The beefing up of the Internal Revenue Service would increase tax payments by the wealthiest Americans, in a departure from the supply-side ethos of the GOP. Opinion: Republicans have to make a fateful choice on what kind of party they want to be At the same time, the semiconductor bill would provide more than $50 billion in federal funding to address a semiconductor chip shortage and make the US less reliant on countries such as China for its manufacturing. The legislation, a rare moment of bipartisanship, will reinvigorate federal investment in key industrial research. \u201cThe private sector,\u201d notes The Washington Post editorial board, \u201cperennially underinvests in basic research \u2013 which is why this area, more than chip-builders with plenty of cash in their pockets, needs the help the most.\u201d There are still many obstacles ahead before the Inflation Reduction Act is passed. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona is continuing to play her cards close to the chest. Democrats will need her vote for the bill to pass. The Senate Parliamentarian will have to also accept each part of the bill as part of reconciliation, while some House Democrats, like New Jersey\u2019s Rep. Josh Gottheimer who want to end the Trump-era limits on deducting state and local taxes, could still cause trouble in the House by making it harder for the Schumer-Manchin bill to secure a majority. But if the bill goes through, Biden will be able to boast that he has delivered on one of the most basic promises of his 2020 campaign \u2013 that he has the ability and willingness to govern. Besides the fact that Biden seemed to Democrats like the antithesis of former President Donald Trump, voters were also supporting an old-fashioned senator who came to the Oval Office with decades of legislative experience and who believed in the art of governing. Opinion: How overhauling this 1887 law could protect US elections After four years of chaos under Trump, as well as ongoing gridlock and dysfunction on Capitol Hill that left issue after issue unaddressed, there was clearly a yearning in the electorate for a sense of normality \u2013 a return to the era when many career politicians devoted every day to diving into the legislative process to find incremental solutions to the big problems that we faced. Biden brought to the White House the kind of deep political experience that we have not seen since the mid-1970s \u2013 except for President George H.W. Bush. Biden is not disillusioned by the slow and unwieldy legislative process. He believes that governing is possible, and he has the kind of patience needed in a system that rarely produces immediate results. Come the midterms and the 2024 election, this would be the kind of leadership that Democrats could sell on the campaign trail, particularly as a contrast to the more radicalized GOP. To be sure, bad economic conditions would likely overwhelm the ability of Democrats to take advantage of these accomplishments. If Americans are feeling pinched and can\u2019t afford basic goods, they probably won\u2019t reward the party in power for addressing climate change. It is also difficult to gauge how effective the inevitable Republican attacks will be on the deal that Manchin has agreed to.  Nonetheless, if Biden and the Democrats can secure and leverage these two victories, combined with the American Rescue Plan and the infrastructure package, the President will have greatly advanced the case that he has helped stabilize conditions in Washington and shown how governing is still something that leaders can do. Concrete benefits such as lower prescription drug prices will matter very much to voters. In an age when so many major crises beg for government as part of the solution, this might well be Biden\u2019s best opportunity to build back a better reelection coalition for 2024.",
