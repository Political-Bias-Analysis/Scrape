Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Three people are dead and eight more are seriously injured after a mass shooting at Oxford High School in Oxford, Michigan. All three who were killed and most of the wounded were students. The suspect, a 15-year-old sophomore at the school, was taken into custody as police arrived on the scene. His parents have hired an attorney and have not let him talk to police, authorities said. The weapon recovered by law enforcement at the scene, a 9MM semi-automatic pistol, was bought Friday by suspect\u2019s father, authorities said. Investigators have a \u201ctremendous amount of video footage\u201d to examine as they work to gather more information about the incident, and they are also looking at the suspect\u2019s social media accounts. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments today in a case that could result in Roe v. Wade being overturned. The Mississippi law at issue bars most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, a standard that violates legal precedent set by the 1973 decision. Several such laws have been enacted across the country recently with the aim of getting the Supreme Court to hear a direct challenge to Roe. A similar law in Texas that drew widespread condemnation was allowed to go into effect in September despite surprising skepticism from some conservative Supreme Court justices. That law is also before the court. While the high court\u2019s decision on both these laws could curtail abortion access in several ways, conservative legislators have long tried to get Roe overturned altogether. By one estimate from the pro-abortion rights Guttmacher Institute, 26 states are certain or likely to ban abortions if the precedent is overturned. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Top US government officials are considering stricter testing requirements for everyone traveling to the US as concerns about the Omicron variant rise. These new requirements could include a Covid-19 test the day before a traveler\u2019s flight and having all travelers \u2013 including US citizens and permanent residents \u2013 test again after getting home. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is working with vaccine manufacturers on contingency plans in case future coronavirus vaccines need to be modified to better fight new variants of the virus. One of the biggest concerns surrounding Omicron is the possibility of \u201cimmune escape,\u201d in which a variant is so mutated from other known strains that it may evade protection of vaccines and treatments. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Mark Meadows, former President Donald Trump\u2019s onetime chief of staff, is now cooperating with the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Meadows is providing records and has agreed to appear for an initial interview, staving off a criminal contempt referral for defying a subpoena from the committee. The panel has tried to come down hard on Trump allies it\u2019s subpoenaed, some of whom, like Meadows and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, have tried to evade legal summons. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger spoke yesterday to the committee about his experience with Trump\u2019s 2020 election lies. During a now-infamous phone call in January, Trump pressed Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn results showing Biden had won the state. Raffensperger refused. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. Myanmar\u2019s military government has filed a new corruption charge against deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and former President Win Myint, according to state-run media. Suu Kyi has faced nearly a dozen cases against her since she and her ruling National League for Democracy party were overthrown in a February military coup. Her lawyers and supporters consider the charges against her to be politically motivated. Suu Kyi has been held in detention at an undisclosed location as Myanmar has descended into violence and fear under the military junta\u2019s rule. Scores of protesters and political opponents have been arrested since the coup, and the military has even targeted medics attending to anti-junta groups. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

(You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) World leaders are meeting at the COP26 summit in Glasgow for some of the most important climate talks in years. More than 120 leaders will speak today, setting the tone for two weeks of negotiations that will hopefully end with a firm global plan to take on, as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said, \u201ccoal, cars, cash and trees.\u201d The latest UN climate report, released in August, painted a dire picture and predicted the world must halve emissions over the next decade to begin reversing disastrous climate effects. President Biden has already pledged to reach that goal by 2030, and part of his mission in Glasgow will be convincing other nations that the US is serious about its climate commitment. Passing that huge US spending bill, with the biggest-ever investment in combatting climate change, would have helped, but it\u2019s still being formulated in Congress. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. House Democratic leaders are pushing for votes on both the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill and the $1.75 trillion economic plan as soon as tomorrow. Many House Progressives signaled yesterday they\u2019d likely back both bills \u2013 a hopeful sign that weekslong gridlock between progressive and moderate Democratic factions may soon end. The economic spending bill has been drastically pared down, and many key Democratic priorities, like paid family leave, have been left on the cutting room floor. However, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg says the Biden administration will continue to push for those priorities in other ways. As far as deadlines, the next important date to watch for is December 3. That\u2019s when newly extended transportation funding \u2013 put in place to buy time on the infrastructure bill \u2013 runs out. That\u2019s also when the US is expected to hit the debt ceiling.

Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. More than 5 million people around the world have died of Covid-19. This staggering threshold was surpassed early this morning, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Last week, the World Health Organization warned that global Covid-19 cases and deaths are increasing for the first time in two months, spurred by big increases in Europe. As cases continue to multiply in some areas, the South Pacific island nation of Tonga has recorded its very first case of Covid-19. The discovery has prompted thousands of Tongans to get vaccinated and could result in a national lockdown. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Members of the House panel investigating the January 6 Capitol riot are reexamining a 134-year-old law that they say former President Trump and his allies exploited to try to prevent the verification of the 2020 election. The Electoral Count Act was meant to give Congress a process by which to certify Electoral College votes submitted by the states. But election experts say it needs updating to ensure that a losing party can never subvert the Electoral College results. The committee\u2019s new interest in this law undercuts a legal argument made by Trump that the panel has no true legislative purpose for seeking his White House documents. Elections will also be top of mind across the country tomorrow, as states and communities head to the polls. Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial race will be of particular interest, as many see it as an early referendum on Democratic and Republican influence leading into next year\u2019s midterms. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area.

Sudan\u2019s Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said he will never \u201cwillingly\u201d stand down and called for an overhaul of Sudan\u2019s fragile political process following a military coup last week. Hamdok has been under house arrest since Sudan\u2019s top general, Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, dissolved the country\u2019s ruling council instead of turning over control of the body to a civilian leader as planned. Hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated across Sudan over the weekend in protest of the military takeover. The activist group that organized the protests is demanding the restoration of the country\u2019s transitional civilian government. Military and civilian groups have maintained a shaky power-sharing alliance in the country since the 2019 Sudan uprising that led to the toppling of President Omar al-Bashir\u2019s three decade rule.

Liberal and moderate Democrats are still at odds over crucial, high-dollar parts of Joe Biden\u2019s legislative agenda. Remember, there are two bills at play here: an infrastructure bill and one focused on social spending and climate. The latter is causing particular concern, with a proposed price tag of $3.5 trillion. Moderate Democrats have balked at the figure and suggested a pared-down version of as little as $1.5 trillion. That\u2019s been rejected by progressives, who are also vowing to withhold their votes on the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill if details of the other bill aren\u2019t ironed out first. The disagreements led House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to delay bringing the infrastructure bill to the floor for a vote late last week and will undoubtedly continue this week. Though Dems are facing criticism for how long it\u2019s taking to agree on these key issues, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin assured that the party won\u2019t let the US default on its debt on October 18. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. A new oral medicine that fights viral infection could give doctors a big leg-up in fighting Covid-19, but experts agree the best way to curb deaths and end the pandemic is still vaccination. Drug makers Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics say their pill, molnupiravir, can reduce risk of Covid-19 hospitalization and death by 50%. They will seek emergency authorization for the antiviral medication from the FDA. Meanwhile, vaccination rates are still holding at about 56% among eligible Americans. Covid-19 has taken the lives of more than 700,000 people in the US, and about 200,000 of those deaths have occurred since vaccinations became widely available. The CDC has also updated its guidance on holiday celebrations as we enter a potentially treacherous winter. It recommends getting vaccinated before gatherings, wearing masks and celebrating virtually. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. The Facebook whistleblower who released tens of thousands of pages of internal research and documents from the company has revealed herself as Frances Haugen, a former Facebook product manager who worked on civic integrity issues at the company. The documents have sparked a firestorm at the company and have even led to the Senate grilling a Facebook exec over the platform\u2019s effect on young users. On \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d Haugen said the company knows its platforms are used to spread hate, violence and misinformation and has tried to hide that evidence. Facebook has\u00a0aggressively pushed back against the reports, calling many of the claims \u201cmisleading.\u201d Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, has pushed back on some related claims, saying for instance that it is \u201cludicrous\u201d to assign blame to Facebook over the January 6 Capitol riot. Clegg also said the company will never be able to control all content on its site but may be open to more regulation.

Protesters gathered across Brazil this weekend to call for the impeachment of President Jair Bolsonaro amid worsening economic conditions, hunger, unemployment and other persistent effects of the pandemic. This is not the first time Brazilians have organized to protest Bolsonaro, who has remained defiant in his handling of Covid-19 even as nearly a staggering 600,000 Brazilians have lost their lives to the virus. Bolsonaro\u2019s approval rating has been on a continuous decline, and polls show more than half the country now considers his presidency to be bad or awful. This is especially important because Brazil is holding a presidential election next year, and there\u2019s a possibility Bolsonaro could be ousted in favor of a more popular politician, like former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area.

A pipeline breach in the Pacific Ocean has dumped more than 3,000 barrels of oil \u2013 equal to about 126,000 gallons of post-production crude \u2013 along the Southern California coast. Dead birds and wildlife have been washing up on Huntington Beach in Orange County, and experts worry the spill could infiltrate wetlands and other vulnerable areas, creating an ecological disaster.\u00a0 The National Transportation Safety Board is sending investigators to gather information and assess the source of the oil spill, which as of yesterday morning had not fully stopped.

(You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Covid-19 cases among US children have risen almost 240% since July, American Academy of Pediatrics data shows. Kids now account for 29% of all cases reported nationwide. This substantial increase has coincided with school reopenings, and experts say vaccine mandates may be the only way to keep in-person classes viable. Children under 12 are not eligible for a vaccine yet, so advocates are urging parents to get vaccinated to protect their children. In China, authorities are rushing to contain what is being dubbed the country\u2019s first \u201cschool centered\u201d outbreak in the southern province of Fujian. The outbreak was traced to an elementary school and could become a huge problem if it\u2019s not contained before the National Day holiday next month, when hundreds of millions of people are expected to travel in the country. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Secretary of State Antony Blinken appeared before the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, becoming the first Biden administration official to publicly account to Congress for the chaotic, violent US withdrawal from Afghanistan that ended last month. Though the hearing brought few answers, it did set up what will likely become an ugly battle between Biden officials defending the hurried exit and Republican lawmakers heavily criticizing it. The painful topic could become especially contentious as we enter the midterm election season. Meanwhile, people in Afghanistan are facing spiraling poverty, possible starvation and economic collapse under Taliban rule, the UN warned. The Taliban has also mandated segregation of genders in classrooms and required women and girls to wear hijabs in academic settings. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Democrats return to Capitol Hill this month with a crushing set of deadlines. First up, the $3.5 trillion social safety net bill has to be finalized by the Senate, then passed through the House next week. That\u2019s easier said than done, since it seems there are still deep divisions within the Democratic ranks about the plan\u2019s scope. Then, the House must vote on the separate, $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill by September 27. After that, the next deadline for government funding is at the beginning of October, and then lawmakers will need to tackle the problem of raising the debt ceiling by the middle of next month \u2013 or risk serious damage to US\u2019 financial reputation. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Parliamentary elections in Norway have shaken up the country\u2019s government, giving the center-left Labor Party a chance to form a new coalition after the ruling Conservatives lost their lead. This also means the end of Prime Minister Erna Solberg\u2019s eight-year reign. Norway\u2019s campaign period heavily focused on the climate crisis and the future of the country\u2019s lucrative oil industry. But a new government doesn\u2019t necessarily mean a boon for climate-minded politicians. The anti-oil party, the Greens, failed to win enough votes to become the potential kingmaker. And even left-leaning politicians have been hesitant to go all-out on fossil fuel reduction since oil contributes significantly to the nation\u2019s wealth. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The California gubernatorial recall election gets underway today, and even though polls suggest Gov. Gavin Newsom will emerge victorious, the issues in play probably won\u2019t go away quietly. The conservative effort to oust the governor gained steam with discontent over Newsom\u2019s stringent measures to fight the pandemic. However, his more recent moves, like vaccine mandates, have seen a broader swell of support. If he wins, the vote of confidence, so to speak, could embolden other leaders to adopt stiffer pandemic safety measures. However, some Republicans are already baselessly calling fraud in the election. Larry Elder, the far-right radio host-turned-politician who\u2019s the GOP\u2019s leading contender in the recall race, has repeatedly warned supporters of cheating and has not committed to accepting the results. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

President Biden is expected today to unveil a plan that will push for new vaccine mandates and testing programs as part of a revamped approach to ending the pandemic. The administration\u2019s six-pronged plan will focus on vaccinating the unvaccinated, further protecting the vaccinated through booster shots, keeping schools open, increasing testing and requiring masks, economic recovery and improving care for those with Covid-19, a source told CNN. Meantime, data revealed that the risk of severe breakthrough Covid-19 cases is higher for older adults and for those with multiple underlying medical conditions. And as doctors feared, it is children who are getting hit hard by Covid-19 as school restarts. \u201cThis virus is really going for the people who are not vaccinated,\u201d said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, associate professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. \u201cAnd among those people are children who don\u2019t qualify for the vaccine.\u201d A record 2,396 children were hospitalized with Covid-19 as of Tuesday, according to official data. Taliban fighters used whips and sticks against women protesting in Kabul following the announcement of a hard-line, male-only interim government, in the group\u2019s latest crackdown on dissent.

The Taliban told CNN they were not involved in her death but have launched an investigation. Meanwhile, China will provide almost $31 million worth of food, winter weather supplies, vaccines and medicine to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan. China also will donate an initial 3 million coronavirus vaccine doses to Afghanistan, state media reported. New Orleans has lifted the curfew imposed after Hurricane Ida as electricity has been restored to most of the city. Across Louisiana, however, more than 240,000 customers are still in the dark. To help with recovery efforts, the Carnival Glory cruise ship announced it has an agreement with New Orleans and FEMA to house hospital staff, first responders and other emergency workers. Additionally, Louisiana\u2019s health department has revoked the licenses of seven nursing homes that sent residents to a warehouse to shelter \u2013 a situation the department said involved unsafe and unsanitary conditions. Seven of the residents died. And here\u2019s a closer look at why Ida\u2019s remnants were so deadly for the Northeast. A US destroyer sailed yesterday near the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea, the US Navy\u2019s 7th Fleet announced, days after China imposed new maritime identification rules that include the disputed waterway. The USS Benfold, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer, sailed within 12 miles of Mischief Reef, a part of the Spratly Islands where the Chinese have built military facilities. China has accused the US of \u201cillegally\u201d entering its waters. \u201cThe activity has seriously violated China\u2019s sovereignty and security,\u201d a statement read. The US 7th Fleet called the Chinese statement \u201cfalse.\u201d The 7th Fleet said it is the \u201clatest in a long string of (People\u2019s Republic of China) actions to misrepresent lawful US maritime operations and assert its excessive and illegitimate maritime claims.\u201d Tensions over the South China Sea come as a report reveals a pro-Chinese government online influence operation is targeting Americans in an effort to exploit divisions over the Covid-19 pandemic and \u201cphysically mobilize protestors in the US in response.\u201d California Gov. Gavin Newsom has been doing everything he can to persuade women to vote \u201cno\u201d on the Republican effort to oust him in Tuesday\u2019s recall election, and Vice President Kamala Harris yesterday helped deliver that message. \u201cYou have to understand that this recall campaign is about California, and it\u2019s about a whole lot more,\u201d Harris said, trying to nationalize the race by voicing her outrage over the conservative agenda, particularly Texas\u2019 new restrictive abortion law. Harris\u2019 involvement comes as Republican candidate Larry Elder told reporters he believes \u201cthere might very well be shenanigans\u201d in the recall election, continuing the baseless GOP effort to undermine elections by suggesting wrongdoing. Though a lot is different about this year\u2019s recall in California, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger described it as \u201cexactly the same\u201d as when he ran.

The National Nurses United union president is criticizing CDC guidance that vaccinated people can largely forego masks, saying it\u2019s confusing and could endanger health care workers. One problem? It relies on an honor system in which unvaccinated people still mask up. At least one local leader has already said such a system just isn\u2019t working. President Biden says there will be enough Covid-19 vaccine supply for every American adult by the end of this month, and his administration is pledging millions more vaccine doses to other countries on top of the 60 million already committed. We\u2019re also learning more about a coronavirus variant first detected in India that has now gone global. The B.1.617 is a \u201cvariant of concern,\u201d which means it could be more transmissible, cause more severe disease or evade tests and treatments. Experts think the variant is driving the recent waves of infection in India. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. The Supreme Court agreed to take up a key abortion case next term that could pose a major challenge to Roe v. Wade. The case concerns a controversial Mississippi law that banned most abortions after 15 weeks. A federal judge struck down the law in 2018. Now that the court has a 6-3 conservative majority, it could set a new precedent that emboldens other states to enact similarly strict abortion laws. Several already have: South Carolina, Oklahoma and Idaho codified so-called \u201cheartbeat bills\u201d this year. Arkansas and Oklahoma enacted near-total abortion bans, and Montana banned the procedure at 20 weeks. None of these bills is in effect yet, with some tied up in court. For the record, polling reveals a majority of Americans want Roe v. Wade to stay in place. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Fifteen unions that represent law enforcement officers across the US have endorsed a policing plan that includes an unprecedented shift in the way unions protect bad police officers. Under the plan, law enforcement officers and those in adjacent professions would be encouraged to act as \u201cactive bystanders\u201d and intervene when another union member is doing something wrong. Meanwhile, a North Carolina DA is set today to reveal the findings of a state investigation into the police shooting of Andrew Brown Jr. What bodycam footage of the April incident, in which deputies shot and killed Brown, actually shows is in dispute. In South Carolina, two deputies involved in the in-custody death of Jamal Sutherland in January have been fired. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Biden has expressed support for a ceasefire in the escalating violence between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza. The President mentioned his position on a call yesterday with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and floated the possibility of international diplomatic involvement. Some Democratic leaders want Biden to be more forceful with US engagement in the conflict. Netanyahu, meantime, has vowed to continue strikes against Hamas targets. The US has been in touch with foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, France, Qatar, Egypt and Pakistan, but demands from Israel and Hamas have so far stymied any solutions. Meanwhile, the volley of rocket attacks and airstrikes continues. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The US is investigating two cases of a mysterious illness that affected White House officials late last year. The cases are consistent with \u201cHavana Syndrome,\u201d an inexplicable combination of sensory experiences and physical symptoms that have sickened more than 100 US diplomats, spies and troops around the globe. One of the latest incidents began after the 2020 election when an NSC official passed through a White House gate. Now, the government has revealed it\u2019s investigating a second, more serious case from weeks later near another White House entrance. The intelligence community still isn\u2019t sure who is causing the strange array of nervous system symptoms or if the episodes can even be called \u201cattacks.\u201d Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system.

The number of global cases of Covid-19 has now been on the rise for nine consecutive weeks, driven in part by the devastating second wave ravaging India. But India isn\u2019t the only place experiencing a record surge. Canada has deployed its military to Ontario as a worsening wave has caused the positivity rate to hit an all-time high in the province. Meanwhile, the US announced it plans to share millions of doses of AstraZeneca\u2019s coronavirus vaccine with other countries in coming months. The vaccine hasn\u2019t yet been granted emergency use authorization by the FDA, so tens of millions of stockpiled units are untouched. And today, President Biden is expected to announce updated CDC guidance on the need to wear masks outdoors. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. The US Census Bureau has released the results of the 2020 census, including new population totals used to reapportion and redistrict seats in the House of Representatives. There are 331 million people living in the US, according to the data. As far as representation goes, Texas is the only state to gain two House seats in the count. Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon will each gain one seat. California, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia will each lose a congressional seat. So will New York, which fell a mere 89 residents short of retaining its current number. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. The Justice Department will investigate the Louisville police department to assess whether the Kentucky agency \u201cengages in a pattern or practice of using unreasonable force.\u201d The decision comes a little more than a year after the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who was killed by police in her home during a botched raid. In North Carolina, calls are mounting for the release of police bodycam video\u00a0in last week\u2019s police shooting of Andrew Brown Jr. A family attorney said the footage she\u2019s seen shows an \u201cexecution.\u201d Peaceful protesters have gathered in Elizabeth City regularly since Brown\u2019s death. Some civil rights advocates are worried about the future of such protests. More than 90 anti-protest bills, which critics say criminalize legal activity, have been introduced in at least 36 states over the last year. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Oklahoma GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a near-total abortion ban and two other abortion restrictions into law, making the state the second this year to enact a so-called heartbeat ban. These laws bar most abortions at the onset of a fetal heartbeat, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy and before many people know they are pregnant. Republican-controlled states have advanced a wave of anti-abortion bills this year consistent with the trend under the Trump presidency. The Oklahoma laws are due to go into effect on November 1 and will likely face immediate legal challenges based on federal precedents set by Roe v. Wade. However, the fact that Oklahoma and other states are pushing such bans shows that the state-level fight over abortion access is far from over. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. China is ramping up its anti-espionage activities with a new set of regulations targeting foreign spies and \u201chostile forces.\u201d Under the new rules, companies and institutions may be asked to keep a watch out for and prevent foreign espionage activity. This means the entities must vet and train personnel who\u2019d then be debriefed on national security issues after foreign visits. Analysts say it\u2019s another way the Chinese government is expanding control and keeping an eye on Western activity. There\u2019s also concern about the Chinese government\u2019s rather broad definition of spying. The new rules come as the Communist Party prepares to mark its 100th anniversary on July 1 and amid worsening relations with the US, which in recent years has charged some with spying for China. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system.

Vaccine advisers to the CDC put off making any decision about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine when they met yesterday, saying they need more information about a rare type of blood clot reported by half a dozen recipients. This means, as Dr. Anthony Fauci stressed, that the recommended pause on the J&J vaccine is just that: a pause, not a cancellation. The federal government is helping those scheduled for a J&J vaccine get set up with an alternative. As other vaccinations continue, the US could have 300 million excess vaccine doses by July, according to researchers. Currently, 10 nations that are home to less than half the world\u2019s population have used three-quarters of Covid-19 vaccine doses, but many poorer countries still don\u2019t have a supply at all. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack.

President Biden\u2019s push to get bipartisan support for his high-dollar infrastructure plans are falling flat. The White House has invited key Republicans to the Oval Office this week, but members are skeptical of the scope and cost of his roughly $2 trillion plan. Of course, Democrats have the legislative tools to pass a bill without a single Republican vote. Meanwhile, the administration is continuing its rollback of Trump-era policies by moving to reverse a rule barring certain federally funded health care providers from referring patients for abortions, a step long demanded by abortion rights groups. The White House has also addressed a recent request for more AAPI inclusion, naming Erika Moritsugu to a senior-level Asian American and Pacific Islander liaison\u00a0position. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Hundreds of executives from high-profile companies like Amazon, Google and Starbucks, have signed a statement opposing discriminatory voting legislation. While it doesn\u2019t name a specific state, the statement continues the recent wave of pushback from major corporations following the passage of a controversial voting law last month in Georgia. Officials in Fulton County, which covers most of Atlanta, passed a resolution yesterday that will allow Georgia\u2019s most populous county to explore legal challenges to the law. Still, similar bills are rolling on in other states. Arkansas\u2019 Republican-controlled legislature just passed a handful of bills that are similar to Georgia\u2019s law, including a provision that would effectively criminalize handing out water or food to those waiting in line to vote. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. The Biden administration is expected to announce sanctions targeting Russian individuals and entities in response to the SolarWinds hack and election interference. The punishments, which could be announced as soon as today, also include new financial restrictions and the expulsion of as many as a dozen Russian diplomats from the US. The sanctions have been a long time coming, in part because the White House wanted more sanctions than the State Department first proposed, a US official said. The US is trying to walk a fine line with Russia, keeping lines of diplomatic communication open while also addressing growing demonstrations of aggression. All 30 members of the NATO alliance have expressed concern about the massive buildup of Russian forces near Crimea and along Ukraine\u2019s borders, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The FBI opens a new investigation into China \u201cevery 10 hours,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said. In comments to the Senate Intelligence Committee, he said more than 2,000 FBI investigations tie back to the Chinese government, and no other country represented more of a threat to US economic security and democratic ideals. China and the US have clashed on several fronts recently, including over alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang and political crackdowns in Hong Kong. John Kerry, the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, landed in Shanghai this week to meet with counterparts ahead of an environmental summit\u00a0this month. The meetings will test whether the US and China can work together on some issues, like climate change, while butting heads on others. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

Biden/Trump 2024 Even though President Joe Biden insists he\u2019s running again \u2013 and Vice President Kamala Harris insists they don\u2019t discuss it, the will-he-or-won\u2019t-he is already underway. (Check out Chris\u2019 great handicapping of the potential field of Biden replacements). Look for the chorus of commentators on the future and face of the Democratic Party to get even louder over the next year. And then there\u2019s former President Donald Trump. His toying with a 2024 run has essentially frozen the GOP field (though not everyone is deterred by Trump in a 2024 primary \u2013 ahem, Gov. Ron DeSantis). The former President still holds a firm grip on his party, with GOP candidates across the country denying that Biden legitimately won the 2020 election, meaning Trump and his big lie will keep their grip on the GOP. 4. January 6 aftermath With 700 criminal cases, at least 50 sentences and likely more to come, repercussions for the January 6 assault on democracy continue to play out in court. And on Capitol Hill, efforts to investigate how the insurrection took place continue to ramp up. The approaching one-year anniversary of the deadly insurrection will also bring sharper focus. 3. SCOTUS The nation\u2019s highest court enters 2022 with a solid conservative majority, pressure on Justice Stephen Breyer to retire so Biden can appoint a younger liberal justice (who Republicans have already vowed to blockade). During oral arguments on December 1, Chief Justice John Roberts floated an idea on abortion rights that would uphold a Mississippi 15-week ban and stop short of ending Roe v. Wade and abortion rights nationwide entirely, but it\u2019s unclear if any colleagues would join him. Simmering concern over the court\u2019s politicization, combined with blockbuster decisions on the horizon, all have the makings of an incredibly significant year for the Supreme Court.

Midterms In November, voters across the country will head to the polls in the first large-scale referendum on President Biden\u2019s first term in office. And history tells us Biden\u2019s current approval rating could spell absolute trouble for the Democratic Party at the ballot box. With a slew of high-profile Democratic retirements, it seems many are reading the writing on the wall. Will the steady stream of departures continue? And ultimately, if conventional wisdom holds (and Biden\u2019s approval rating stays low) how large will the GOP\u2019s margins be on Election Day? 1.

            "article_content": "As the calendar turns to 2022, Senate races are about to kick into much higher gear, with ad spending increasing ahead of the first primaries in May and just a few more fundraising quarters for candidates to prove they\u2019re serious 'A 50-50 Senate sucks': Dejected Democrats fret over agenda failure amid grim 2022 outlook The biggest storyline to watch heading into 2022 is the resolution of contested GOP primaries. In at least six of the 10 states on this list, Republicans are facing unsettled fields \u2013 some more problematic for the party than others \u2013 that may go a long way toward shaping their ability to harness a favorable political environment. Developments in these states over the past month have been mixed for the GOP. Some Republicans feel like they dodged a bullet in Pennsylvania, where the candidate backed by former President Donald Trump dropped out. But in New Hampshire, they\u2019re disappointed the governor isn\u2019t running for Senate. The power of the ex-President\u2019s endorsement is still an open question in some places, but as Republicans across the country scramble for his blessing, primaries look very much like the Trump loyalty contests of 2018 and 2020 \u2013 except with the added (and increasingly dangerous) litmus test of election denialism. Candidates are repeating various versions of Trump\u2019s lies about fraud in the 2020 election to curry favor with the former commander in chief. But as elections in Virginia and New Jersey last month showed, the national environment is significantly worse for Democrats than it was just months after President Joe Biden\u2019s victory and after Democrats flipped two Georgia Senate seats. Rising inflation and a pandemic that is once again raising questions about Americans\u2019 ability to gather this holiday season are contributing to a gloomy mood that\u2019s overshadowed any enthusiasm about Washington having passed a bipartisan infrastructure deal. Three-quarters of Americans say they are worried about the state of the economy in their own community, according to a new CNN poll released Wednesday. More than half disapprove of the way Biden is handling the economy. The party in the White House typically suffers losses in the first midterm of a new president\u2019s term. Next year isn\u2019t looking any different, with longtime House Democrats already heading for the exit \u2013 a tell-tale sign of veteran lawmakers who aren\u2019t eager to be in the minority. But at the close of the so-called off-year, the Senate map doesn\u2019t look all that different from this spring, when CNN first ranked the seats most likely to flip. The top three seats, for example, remain the same: Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip are based on CNN\u2019s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. As the cycle heats up, more polling and advertising spending data will become factors. Here are the seats most likely to flip next fall: Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) The biggest shakeup over the last month was the departure of Army veteran Sean Parnell \u2013 a relief for Republicans who had begun to worry that the headlines from the Trump-backed candidate\u2019s custody battle could seriously hurt his ability to win a general election. (Parnell suspended his campaign after a judge awarded his estranged wife primary physical custody and sole legal custody of the couple\u2019s three children.) His exodus has made room for ambitious Republicans who smell an opportunity, like Dr. Mehmet Oz, a cardiothoracic surgeon and television personality. The Ohio native, who attended medical school in the state, has talked up the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a way to treat the coronavirus \u2014 despite the lack of firm scientific evidence that it is an effective treatment. \u201cWashington got Covid wrong,\u201d he says in a TV ad, vowing to \u201cput America first.\u201d A longtime New Jersey resident, Oz is not the only candidate or potential candidate who\u2019s lived elsewhere, although it remains to be seen whether voters really care about that in such a nationalized political environment. David McCormick, a former official in the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush, may soon enter the race, joining businessman Jeff Bartos, who helped publicize Parnell\u2019s personal life issues after Trump passed him over for the endorsement, and Carla Sands, Trump\u2019s ambassador to Denmark. With GOP Sen. Pat Toomey retiring, Democrats have long seen the Keystone State, which voted for Biden, as one of their top pickup opportunities. Democrats have a crowded primary of their own \u2013 and the GOP is excited about the prospect of facing top fundraiser Lt. Gov. John Fetterman \u2013 but the fundamentals of the state make this one harder for Republicans to hold than some others. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock The intrigue in Georgia has shifted from the Senate race \u2013 where Republican Herschel Walker seems to have married the interests of Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 to the gubernatorial race, with former Sen. David Perdue announcing a Trump-backed primary challenge to GOP Gov. Brian Kemp earlier this month. McConnell had once sought Perdue or former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, both of whom lost January runoffs, to challenge Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who\u2019s now running for a full six-year term. But Perdue\u2019s gubernatorial candidacy underscores just how much the GOP Senate landscape here has changed (although Walker still faces a primary against Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black and former Trump national security official Latham Saddler among others.) Some Republicans who had once balked at Walker running in the Peach State now seem impressed by his team and argue that his openness about his mental health struggles could be a positive attribute on the campaign trail. And the fact that Walker wouldn\u2019t wade into the gubernatorial primary was seen as a sign he\u2019s taking his race seriously rather than just bowing to the political whims of Trump, who has called Perdue and Walker an \u201cunstoppable team.\u201d On the Democratic side, news that 2018 nominee Stacey Abrams is running for governor again is exciting Democrats, who hope she\u2019ll help drive minority turnout in a non-presidential year. High-profile names in the governor\u2019s race ensure that Georgia will once again be the epicenter of the political universe in 2022. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson GOP Sen. Ron Johnson has plenty to say about Covid-19 these days \u2013 much of it misleading or offensive \u2013 but less about whether he\u2019s running for a third term. As of now, he would be the only Republican senator running for reelection in a state Biden carried in 2020. While he keeps Republicans guessing, Democrats have assembled a crowded field that\u2019s just as eager to take on the incumbent as run for an open seat. Biden only won this state by about half a point last year, however, after Trump won it by a similarly narrow margin in 2016. That makes it competitive terrain that may not be so favorable to Democrats if the national environment is against them. But whether he runs or not, Johnson, who\u2019s already been endorsed by Trump, isn\u2019t doing himself \u2013 or his party \u2013 any favors. His penchant for saying controversial things, while it may be resonating with GOP base voters, is giving Democrats a rich target as they try to peel off independents. And should he decide not to run for reelection, his prolonged indecision isn\u2019t giving potential GOP successors the opportunity to start introducing themselves around the state. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly is running for a full six-year term after winning a special election last year. An astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, he has a compelling personal story and is an impressive fundraiser. The biggest advantage he may have right now, however, is a Republican field in disarray without an obvious candidate that can cut through the noise. Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who holds the most prominent statewide elected office of the bunch, doesn\u2019t seem to be putting together the resources needed for a top-tier campaign. Trump hasn\u2019t endorsed here, so the candidates will continue to snipe about who\u2019s most loyal to him and his ideas about election fraud. But the primary isn\u2019t until August, so whoever emerges as the nominee will need to quickly pivot to general election mode. Still, Biden became the first Democrat to carry the state since 1996 \u2013 and by less than half a point \u2013 so this state will likely be competitive regardless of the matchup. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto This is one GOP primary that\u2019s relatively settled, with former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt already having the backing of both McConnell and Trump. The grandson of the former governor and senator with the same last name, Laxalt is trying to unseat first-term Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the country\u2019s first Latina senator. \u201cNevada is a purple state, and it\u2019s always competitive,\u201d she told CNN in a recent interview. Indeed, she only won by about 2 points in 2016, as did Hillary Clinton \u2013 a margin Biden replicated four years later. GOP inroads with Hispanic voters could make this seat more competitive \u2013 especially if Republicans are already focused on the general election campaign and not wasting all their time and money in as messy a primary as they are in other states \u2013 while the state Democratic Party is the one struggling with internal divisions. Democrats are trying to paint Laxalt, the former Trump campaign co-chair for the state, as out of touch with Nevadans. He\u2019s questioned Biden\u2019s victory in the state and opposes abortion. (Nevada has a history of Republicans backing abortion rights in former Gov. Brian Sandoval, who declined to endorse Laxalt when he unsuccessfully ran to succeed him.) And with major abortion rights cases before the Supreme Court, the issue could make it into more campaign ads than usual in 2022. But Republicans point to voters\u2019 economic concerns, arguing that playing up abortion (the way Democrats infamously did in a 2014 Colorado Senate race) could backfire. Cortez Masto, however, has also been talking up her support for the bipartisan infrastructure law as a contrast between her and Laxalt. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) North Carolina\u2019s primaries had been among the earliest in the nation, but candidates now have a few extra weeks to make their case to voters, with the state Supreme Court delaying the nominating contests from March to May because of redistricting legal challenges. The Republican field is still reckoning with Trump\u2019s early endorsement of Rep. Ted Budd, as the political arm of the conservative Club for Growth spends big to promote him as the former President\u2019s chosen candidate. As CNN has reported, Trump enlisted Rep. Madison Cawthorn to try to convince former Rep. Mark Walker to run for the House instead since Budd allies think they\u2019d have a stronger shot in a one-on-one race against former Gov. Pat McCrory, who occupies a more establishment Republican lane. Walker and his wife, seated in front of a Christmas tree and stockings, said in a video message released earlier this week that they\u2019d be reviewing his options over the holidays. \u201cOn paper, it makes more sense for us to reengage in the US House and continue this fight,\u201d Walker said, noting there was a \u201cnarrow path\u201d to Senate victory. While Republicans continue to attack each other here, the Democratic field has essentially sorted itself, positioning Cheri Beasley \u2013 the first Black woman to serve as chief justice of the state Supreme Court \u2013 as the likely nominee. Former state Sen. Erica Smith switched to a House race last month, and state Sen. Jeff Jackson dropped out Thursday, arguing that Democrats need to be united to have a chance of flipping this seat. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan Christmas came early for first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan last month when the Republicans who could have given her the closest race passed. Gov. Chris Sununu announced he\u2019d run for reelection, which was quickly followed by former Sen. Kelly Ayotte taking herself out of contention. Ret. Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc, who raised just five figures in the third quarter, isn\u2019t likely to have the GOP field to himself much longer. There\u2019s no shortage of Republican names swirling around \u2013 with announcements likely coming in the new year \u2013 but that\u2019s also what worries some Republicans: if there\u2019s no field-clearing name like Sununu, candidates could be duking it out until the September primary. Republicans have always felt that Hassan was vulnerable, with or without Sununu, and although the Granite State has trended blue in recent federal elections, they\u2019re optimistic a favorable national environment will put this one in play for them. Still, without a well-defined GOP opponent ready to take on Hassan, this race remains in the bottom half of the seats most likely to flip. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio GOP Sen. Marco Rubio is running for a third term with the backing of Trump and is likely to face Democratic Rep. Val Demings. It\u2019s an uphill climb for Democrats in a state that\u2019s trended red in recent years, but Demings\u2019 profile as the former Orlando police chief and her impressive fundraising are likely to keep Democrats at least competitive. She outraised Rubio by about $2.5 million in the third quarter, although he ended with more cash on hand. Whether she\u2019s able to sustain that momentum (and whether it translates to on-the-ground support) will be key questions heading into the new year. Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) This is another race where the retirement of a GOP veteran has given way to a messy primary. There\u2019s a wide field of wannabe GOP successors to Sen. Rob Portman, except few of them want to actually replicate his tenure in Congress, where he was one of the lead negotiators of the bipartisan infrastructure law. Most are more interested in earning the endorsement of Trump (who trashed the infrastructure deal) and are attacking each other over their loyalty to the ex-President. Trump hasn\u2019t picked a favorite here yet but has indicated he will eventually. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, meanwhile, has been coalescing support to win his primary. Regardless of who emerges from the Republican primary, however, Ryan is in for a tough general election in an increasingly red state. Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring) Trump has also suggested he\u2019ll be endorsing in Missouri\u2019s Senate race, where GOP Sen. Roy Blunt is retiring. The biggest concern has been that he\u2019d pick disgraced former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct. Trump was noncommittal in an interview with Hugh Hewitt earlier this month, who implored him not to endorse the former governor. \u201cWell, that\u2019s an interesting opinion, that\u2019s true. He\u2019s right now leading by quite a bit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI know, but he will lose the seat. We will lose the seat,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cI understand that. Okay, some people feel that,\u201d Trump responded. Kimberly Guilfoyle, a top official on Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign and the girlfriend of Trump\u2019s son, is the national chair of Greitens\u2019 campaign. GOP Rep. Billy Long met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago last month, so he could be another potential endorsee. But the field keeps growing, with state Senate President Dave Schatz announcing his campaign last month. The fear is that an increasingly splintered field will only mean more votes for Greitens, who could jeopardize what should be a safe Republican seat much the same way Todd Akin did in 2012.",

            "article_content": "The country is not ready for what\u2019s coming next from the Supreme Court. Individual justices themselves say it. The court\u2019s message to the country in recent months has smacked of politics. Most conspicuously, the justices have repeatedly rejected requests to prevent a Texas abortion law that outright conflicts with women\u2019s constitutional rights under the 1973 Roe v. Wade. The remade conservative majority also appears ready to strike down New York gun control regulations and require state aid for religious schools in Maine. This moment has been building for years, as the politicized confirmation process delivered justices with firmer ideologies and agendas. But the court\u2019s right turn has been startlingly accelerated by the abortion-rights controversy. What makes this juncture so fraught is the politicized circumstances, the threat to precedent and the warnings from justices themselves. What John Roberts' role in Texas' abortion case could signal for the future of Roe Former President Donald Trump vowed to appoint justices who would oppose abortion rights and overturn Roe v. Wade, and all three of his appointees appear to be working toward that goal with speed. More than anything in recent years, the justices\u2019 actions in abortion cases from Texas and Mississippi have belied Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 adage of 2018, in retort to Trump himself: \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.\u201d While the Texas dispute has suspended abortion rights in that state, a pending Mississippi case would have nationwide ramifications. During oral arguments on December 1, a majority appeared ready to overturn the half-century old Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal nationwide. The justices in 1973 said the 14th Amendment\u2019s guarantee of privacy covers a woman\u2019s right to terminate a pregnancy in the early stages. The current situation recalls, and perhaps rivals, the Bush v. Gore controversy of 2000, when dissenting senior Justice John Paul Stevens lamented the loss of \u201cthe Nation\u2019s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law.\u201d Last week in the Texas abortion case, dissenting Chief Justice Roberts warned, \u201cit is the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system that is at stake.\u201d The 2000 case resolving the disputed Florida presidential election results and ensuring then-Texas Governor George W. Bush won the White House over then-Vice President Al Gore shook the country. The legal issues were largely contained, despite the obvious national implications. The case was decided 5-4 along ideological, if not political, lines. Today\u2019s disregard for precedent and the potential domino effect in other cases suggests a whole new era at America\u2019s high court. Justice Sonia Sotomayor regularly warns the country about the court\u2019s direction. \u201cThis choice to shrink from Texas\u2019 challenge to federal supremacy will have far-reaching repercussions,\u201d she wrote last Friday. \u201cI doubt the Court, let alone the country, is prepared to them.\u201d Roberts as naysayer, however, is new. \u201cThe clear purpose and actual effect of S.B. 8 has been to nullify this Court\u2019s rulings,\u201d he said of the Texas abortion ban, adding, with language from an 1809 precedent, that if other states \u201cannul the judgments of the courts of the United States, and destroy the rights acquired under those judgments, the constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery.\u201d It is a sign of this court\u2019s rightward march that Roberts, a conservative Republican appointee, agonizes over the turn of events. President Joe Biden\u2019s bipartisan commission on Supreme Court reform, which issued a cautious, measured report last week without concrete recommendations, highlighted the politics of the moment and questions of court legitimacy. It emphasized how much power individual justices now hold (serving for an average of 26 years, up from an average 15 years in the 1960s) and the investment of the dueling political parties in who is appointed. Biden Supreme Court commission's draft report details 'profound' disagreement over adding seats to bench \u201cThe highly polarized politics of the current era threaten to transform this already high-stakes process into one that is badly broken,\u201d the commission wrote, saying that the current calls to expand the size of the court trace to 2016 when Senate Republicans refused to act on President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland. After the GOP-controlled Senate shut out Garland, it sped through Trump\u2019s choices of Neil Gorsuch in 2017, Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 and Amy Coney Barrett in 2020. Those three new justices, augmenting a prior right-wing tilt, have altered public expectations for both sides of such culture war issues as abortion, guns and religion. During the Mississippi arguments earlier this month, Kavanaugh diminished the value of precedent and, shunning the right enshrined in 1973, imagined a Constitution that would be, in his words, \u201cneutral \u2026 neither pro-choice nor pro-life.\u201d His words clashed with his 2018 Senate testimony, when he professed respect for Roe and related cases. In a separate, contentious area of the law, the conservative majority has increasingly allowed mixing of church and state. In recent oral arguments, it appeared ready to strike down a Maine education program that provides vouchers for public and private schools, but not those with a sectarian religious curriculum. Liberal Justice Elena Kagan stressed the distinct nature of the program serving students in isolated areas and raised the risk of a sweeping decision directing taxpayer money to religious schools that exclude non-Christians and LGBTQ students: \u201cThese schools are overtly discriminatory. They\u2019re proudly discriminatory. Other people won\u2019t understand why in the world their taxpayer dollars are going to discriminatory schools.\u201d Unlike with the new abortion-rights controversy, the shift toward conservative religious interests has been developing for years. And the pattern on church-state dilemmas is not without caveat, as seen this week when the justices brushed away religious objections to New York\u2019s vaccine mandate. Supreme Court ruling on Texas law was the result of decades of pressure from anti-abortion groups to shape the court Siding with doctors and nurses who protested that the mandate lacked any religious exemptions, Gorsuch wrote in dissent: \u201cWe should know the costs that come when this Court stands silent as majorities invade the constitutional rights of the unpopular and unorthodox.\u201d The shift on abortion rights has prompted the greatest internal recriminations and public outcry. It became evident on September 1 when the court by a 5-4 vote let Texas go forward with a law that prohibits abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, at roughly six weeks. State lawmakers have tried to shield themselves from federal lawsuit by turning over enforcement of the law to private citizens. That tactic outraged Roberts and the three liberals who dissented in September and also from last week\u2019s decision that largely disadvantaged the abortion clinics seeking to prevent the law from being used against them. Gorsuch and fellow conservatives in the majority expressed scant concern for Texas insulating itself from legal responsibility, and, alternatively, found the clinics\u2019 position troubling, as they seek to block the ban that could lead to devastating liability. \u201cTroubling,\u201d Gorsuch wrote, \u201cthe petitioners have not offered any meaningful limiting principles for their theory.\u201d California governor says he will use legal tactics of Texas abortion ban to implement gun control Under S.B. 8, any person can bring a case against a physician or anyone who assists a woman in obtaining an abortion after six weeks; it allows a minimum of $10,000 in damages for successful suits. The Gorsuch bloc permitted lawsuits against one group of state officers, certain licensing officials, but kept S.B. 8 in place. Roberts said the law had already chilled the provision of abortions in Texas, denying women rights that the court had previously upheld. The separate case from Mississippi involves a ban on abortion after 15 weeks. While less restrictive than the Texas statute, it blatantly conflicts with the court\u2019s abortion-rights decisions prohibiting states from interfering with a woman\u2019s choice to end a pregnancy before a fetus reaches viability, that is, can live outside the womb, at about 23 weeks. Roe v. Wade set the fetal-viability cutoff, and it was reaffirmed in the 1992 decision known as Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The majority then, five justices who happened to be Republican appointees, took account of all the political pressure on them to reverse precedent. As they declined, they emphasized the importance of stability in the law. The 1992 adherence to Roe, Kagan observed during this month\u2019s arguments in the Mississippi case, helped \u201cprevent people from thinking that this Court is a political institution that will go back and forth depending on what part of the public yells loudest and \u2026 will go back and forth depending on changes to the Court\u2019s membership.\u201d But changes in the membership have now transformed America\u2019s highest court. As precedents dissolve, people can only guess where the court will go next.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story has been updated following the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on December 10. It originally published on September 4, 2021. The anti-abortion movement has won its biggest returns yet on its decades-long investment on reshaping the courts, with a Supreme Court order that allowed the country\u2019s second most populous state to cut off almost all access to the procedure. For a generation, abortion foes have employed a multi-pronged strategy of electing state and national anti-abortion rights politicians who would pass restrictive bills while unifying the Republican Party around their cause. But creating a regime that severely limits or outright outlaws the procedure depended on one goal over all: getting justices on the bench who would be willing to reverse the approach high court had taken to abortion rights. What John Roberts' role in Texas' abortion case could signal for the future of Roe \u201cThe most likely way that you can affect the court and how they decide cases is by who\u2019s on the court,\u201d Jim Bopp, who has served as the National Right to Life Committee\u2019s chief lawyer since 1978, told CNN. RELATED: What John Roberts\u2019 role in Texas\u2019 abortion case could signal for the future of Roe The pivotal moment came in the 2016 election, when social conservatives who were otherwise skeptical of Donald Trump pulled the lever for him largely because to the vows he made to them on the Supreme Court. During the campaign, Trump broke political norms by promising justices who would \u201cautomatically\u201d overturn Supreme Court abortion precedent, with explicit commitments that were a far cry from the coyness and subtle hints that past Republican candidates would invoke to describe their approach to judicial nominations. At the time, one seat on the Supreme Court was already up for grabs. But ultimately President Trump was able to confirm three justices, while remaking the lower courts as well. Trump\u2019s justices made up the bulk of conservative five-vote majority that allowed Texas this year to implement a six-week ban on abortion, the strictest abortion law that\u2019s been allowed to go into effect since Roe v. Wade and one that blatantly violates the precedent that 1973 decision set. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing unfold now is the end result of decades\u2019 worth of strategy by a bunch of brilliant people who\u2019ve been broadly underestimated by the media in much of the beltway,\u201d said Mary Zigler, a professor at Florida State University College of Law and the author of Abortion and the Law in America. When anti-abortion activists were hashing out their approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they probably did not think that the president who would ultimately deliver for them would be a twice divorced New York real estate mogul who once described himself as \u201cvery pro-choice.\u201d Supreme Court lets Texas abortion law continue but says providers can sue Even during the 2016 campaign, Trump managed to trample over the anti-abortion movement\u2019s carefully planned messaging strategy. But in one regard, he told the activists exactly what they wanted \u2013 and, after years of disappointments from past GOP-appointed justices such as David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, needed \u2013 to hear: that his choices would be cut from an originalist cloth. And he was willing to name names to make that clear. At a February 2016 primary debate \u2013 which fell on the same day that news of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death broke and made the Supreme Court a front-burner campaign issue \u2013 several Republican candidates made promises to fill Scalia\u2019s seat with a justice that would fit his mold. But only Trump offered the names of specific living jurists \u2013 arch-conservative US District Judges Diane Sykes and William Pryor \u2013 who would be of the kind he would appoint. The remark \u201ccaught people\u2019s attention,\u201d said Carrie Severino, the president of the conservative Judicial Crisis Network. \u201cLook, he didn\u2019t know Bill Pryor and Diane Sykes but he had a legal team around him that knew how to identify people would be good candidates,\u201d Severino said. \u201cHe had named names before someone like [Texas Senator and 2016 presidential candidate] Ted Cruz, who I\u2019m sure personally knows both those people and could have named off them off the top of his head.\u201d Trump doubled down on the approach with two lists he released during the campaign of other potential nominees that would guide his approach to the Supreme Court. The May 2016 list of 11 names described them as \u201crepresentative of the kind of constitutional principles I value,\u201d while the second, expanded list \u2013 released that September \u2013 made concrete a promise that he would pick for Scalia\u2019s vacancy one of those 21 individuals. That second list and its firmer commitment was what won over Cruz, the slowest among the 2016 GOP field to drop out, and likely secured up the support of many other Trump skeptics. The tactic resonated with both the anti-abortion community and the conservative legal movement writ large because for years they had felt betrayed by previous GOP appointees to the court, who joined liberals on abortion cases and other decisions of immense importance to the right. It also stood out to them that within the Trump campaign\u2019s inner circle was Don McGahn, a well-known conservative lawyer who went on to be White House counsel, and Mike Pence, Trump\u2019s vice president with well established anti-abortion bona fides. California governor says he will use legal tactics of Texas abortion ban to implement gun control The lengths that Trump went to earn conservatives\u2019 trust on the courts \u2013 coupled with then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s legacy-making decision to block consideration of the nominee President Barack Obama had put forward for Scalia\u2019s seat \u2013 likely delivered Trump the White House. One fifth of 2020 presidential voters deemed the Supreme Court their top priority at the ballot box, according CNN exit polling, and those voters broke decisively for Trump. The mindset among GOP rank-and-file of elevating the courts over all else wasn\u2019t born overnight with Scalia\u2019s death, but the product of a multi-decade campaign to push back on Supreme Court doctrine that conservatives believed overreached beyond the justices\u2019 mandate. The anti-abortion community was easily at home in this movement toward a judicial philosophy known as originalism, which espouses that the constitution should be interpreted by the meaning of the words from when they were written. There, they were joined by other constituencies on the right, like gun rights advocates and economic conservatives who see a judiciary that embraces originalism as key to their policy agendas. But in some ways, Roe was chief of among several Supreme Court decisions that this movement despised. Though there are several policy areas and court precedents that originalism implicates, abortion jurisprudence has stood out in how it has animated the push. \u201cSince 1973, It\u2019s been our opponents who have had the court locked down,\u201d said Mallory Quigley, a vice president of communications for the Susan B. Anthony List, which supports anti-abortion candidates and has mobilized aggressively around Supreme Court confirmation battles. \u201cThey have had everything to lose, we\u2019ve had everything to gain.\u201d Originalist thought permeated from academia into the Reagan administration, with Attorney General Ed Meese delivering several milestone speeches on the subject. The movement also had a champion in Scalia, perhaps the most prominent advocate of the approach. But their path to having now four justices who explicitly embrace the approach was not without setbacks. There was the defeat of the Reagan Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, a prominent originalist, in the Senate in 1987. Democrats explicitly connected Bork\u2019s originalist views with the threat that Roe would be overturned. \u201cThere you have, for the first time, this combination of the originalism movement and the anti-abortion movement in a single political event,\u201d Adam White, a legal scholar at the conservative think tank the American Enterprise Institute, told CNN. Congress could protect access to abortion. Here's why that's unlikely to happen. Still, a 1992 Supreme Court abortion case from Pennsylvania made it only clearer to anti-abortion activists that blind trust in whomever a Republican nominated would not be enough. In that case, the majority reaffirmed Roe while striking down the state\u2019s spousal notification requirement. \u201cConservatives thought they really were on the verge of overturning Roe v. Wade, and suddenly find themselves losing the case in a decision where the key justices are all Republican appointees,\u201d White said. By the George W. Bush administration, anti-abortion activists had honed enough focus on the courts to sink the Supreme Court nomination of Harriet Miers, the White House counsel whom Bush nominated to fill Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor\u2019s seat, because she lacked a track record they could trust. After her withdrawal, Bush instead nominated Justice Samuel Alito, who was among the five who voted not to block Texas\u2019 abortion ban this week. It\u2019s an irony of fate that the death of Scalia, originalism\u2019s most famous practitioner, set the stage for the movement to have its biggest imprint on the court yet. Abortion is just one area of law where the 6-3 majority could take the court in a drastically new direction. Anti-abortion activists played a significant role in making that happen. They lobbied Senate Republicans not to move forward with the nomination of Merrick Garland, Obama\u2019s choice to replace Scalia. They then spent big \u2013 $18 million was what SBA List put forward \u2013 to get Trump elected and keep the Senate under Republican control. The circumstances of the confirmation fights that each Trump nominee faced presented additional obstacles where the unwavering support of the anti-abortion community helped get the nominees over the finish line. Tapper presses GOP governor on Mississippi abortion ban Justice Neil Gorsuch \u2013 whose confirmation required the end of the Senate filibuster for Supreme Court nominees \u2013 benefited from a digital ad campaign and advocacy effort from SBA List. Anti-abortion activists hosted rallies across the country in support of Judge Brett Kavanaugh, including after his confirmation was nearly derailed following allegations of sexual assault from when he was in high school (Kavanaugh has always denied the allegations). While some Republicans expressed discomfort with confirming Justice Amy Coney Barrett so close to the 2020 election, SBA List also put up a six-figure ad buy to urge them to move forward. During each of these confirmation fights, progressives were mocked for warning Roe was on the chopping block. Their warnings are looking prescient now, in light of the Texas action and with an opinion next spring in the Mississippi case which will allow the court to formally over return Roe, if it so chooses. Doubters could have also looked to how South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, while hosting a confirmation hearing for Barrett as Senate Judiciary chairman last fall, borrowed from Trump\u2019s playbook and described in explicit terms what she was being sent to the court to do. He praised her as \u201cunabashedly pro-life,\u201d and told her, \u201ca seat at the table is waiting for you.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments.",

            "article_content": "In an interview with Donald Trump earlier this week, conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt said something truly breathtaking. \u201cYou know, Mr. President, you and I disagree about the election, but we agree on so much,\u201d Hewitt told Trump, segueing into a conversation about China\u2019s hypersonic missiles. Talk about an other-than-that-how-was-the-play-Mrs. Lincoln moment! That Hewitt uttered that line without irony is a telling window into how conservatives have found ways to rationalize Trump and his fundamentally anti-democratic attempts to undermine the faith of the American public in the 2020 election results. Here\u2019s the reality: You can\u2019t just sort of yada yada the election rejection embraced by Trump. Because in refusing to accept the result of the 2020 election and repeatedly (and falsely) alleging voter fraud, Trump is actively working against everything that makes America, well, America. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Hewitt\u2019s attempt to dismiss his disagreement with Trump over the election then as just another policy disagreement is laughable. This isn\u2019t Hewitt saying we should have stayed in Afghanistan and Trump saying we should have pulled American troops out. This is the former President of the United States refusing to accept the results of a national election. And, it\u2019s actually more than that. It\u2019s that Trump has turned election denialism into a litmus test for aspiring Republican candidates. If you aren\u2019t willing to say you believe \u2013 contra all available evidence \u2013 that the 2020 election was stolen, then you not only won\u2019t have Trump\u2019s support but may well find him actively working to defeat you when you run for reelection. (See Brian Kemp and David Perdue in Georgia. Also Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel.) Trump is working to make a belief that the 2020 election was stolen a central piece of the Republican Party platform. And, again, this isn\u2019t like making abortion or trade a party platform. This is making a rejection of American democracy a major part of what it means to be a Republican. Because of all of that, Hewitt can\u2019t simply write what Trump is doing as a place where they disagree. That sort of justification is how we got into this mess, with one of the two major political parties in the country devolving more into a cult of personality than any sort of organization gathered together by a shared set of principles and policies. Refusing to believe in the results of a free and fair election have to be disqualifying for any party leader. It\u2019s non-negotiable. If we can\u2019t agree that the election was fair \u2013 even if our preferred candidate lost \u2013 then we have sacrificed the thing that makes America great. That Hewitt  \u2013 and his fellow conservatives who continue to bend over backward to placate Trump \u2013 can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) see that suggests just how lost the conservative movement is at the moment.",

            "article_content": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell didn\u2019t get the candidate he wanted in New Hampshire. He\u2019s seen states like Pennsylvania and Arizona turn into brutal primary fights. And he\u2019s had to deal with the constant barrage of attacks from former President Donald Trump over his leadership. But the 2022 midterms could still deliver him the majority, in no small part because of the shifting dynamics in Nevada, a state that voted for Democrats in Senate races in 2018 and 2016 and every presidential race since 2008, including for Joe Biden in 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has hit Nevada harder than most states. Republican chances of flipping the Senate next year are rising as President Biden\u2019s approval ratings fall across the country. And GOP Senate candidate Adam Laxalt has done something few Republican challengers have accomplished: Unite the McConnell and Trump wings. Asked on Monday if he\u2019s backing Laxalt against first-term Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, McConnell told CNN, \u201cI am.\u201d In an interview, Cortez Masto said her \u201cnumber one focus\u201d is to help Nevada get through the pandemic and that she understood her race will be one of the toughest next year. She said that tourists have not returned to Las Vegas at pre-pandemic levels and acknowledged that Nevada\u2019s unemployment rate, 7.3%, is the worst in the country. \u201cNevada is a purple state, and it\u2019s always competitive,\u201d Cortez Masto told CNN, noting she won by just two points in her first win in 2016. \u201cMitch McConnell sees Nevada as a top pick up opportunity. He and his allies have already spent millions of dollars against me so far.\u201d Asked about Biden\u2019s low approval rating, she said people care about issues like the economy, health care, education and child care \u2013 not the President\u2019s standing. \u201cWhen I am home, when I talk to Nevadans, it isn\u2019t about the President of the United States,\u201d Cortez Masto said. Laxalt could have a number of vulnerabilities as a candidate. He lost his 2018 governor\u2019s race after then-Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval declined to endorse him. Laxalt co-chaired Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign in Nevada, questioned the integrity of the 2020 election and Biden\u2019s victory in the state, and has already raised the prospect of filing voter fraud lawsuits early for 2022. There are 75,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans in Nevada. The money has been pouring in from both sides: $9 million has already been dumped on the air, according to a media buyer involved in a race. The Senate GOP primary is not over. Major Trump donor Don Ahern has publicly urged the former President to instead back Army veteran Sam Brown, who was severely burned while serving in Afghanistan and raised over $1 million in the third financial quarter of the year. But Laxalt is favored to win the GOP nomination after earning the support of his party\u2019s leaders. In August, Trump endorsed Laxalt, the grandson of former Nevada Governor and Senator Paul Laxalt, saying, \u201cHe fought valiantly against the Election Fraud, which took place in Nevada.\u201d Laxalt is now focused on turning his Senate campaign into a referendum on Biden\u2019s presidency. \u201cWith massive job losses, rising violent crime, and sky-high inflation, Nevada has experienced the failures of Joe Biden\u2019s agenda more than any other state,\u201d Laxalt said in a statement. \u201cCatherine Cortez Masto enables the woke left as they lead our country into stagnation and decline.\u201d Laxalt added: \u201cNevada will be the 51st seat in a new Republican Senate majority when we defeat Masto.\u201d In the interview, Cortez Masto, the first Latina elected to the Senate, countered that Laxalt opposed abortion rights and the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill, which would inject hundreds of billions of dollars upgrading roads, bridges, transit, rail, broadband, airports, ports and waterways in the United States. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a real choice in this election,\u201d Cortez Masto told CNN. The six Senate seats most likely to flip next year are currently held by three Democrats in Nevada, Georgia and Arizona and three Republicans in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden narrowly won five of those states in 2020 and lost the sixth, North Carolina, by about a point. Republicans had hoped to put New Hampshire on the map, but are struggling to find a top-tier candidate against Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan after Gov. Chris Sununu passed. The Democrats control the 50-50 Senate only with the tie-breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. They are hoping to protect their incumbents and pad their majority by winning seats in those battleground states, including in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, where the incumbent Republicans are retiring and leaving behind messy primaries. But Biden is unpopular heading into his first midterm election, when the party out of power typically does well, and the national environment seems to have only gotten worse and worse for Democrats over the past few months. Major surveys conducted in the latter half of November put Biden\u2019s approval ratings among US adults in the 42-46% range. Cortez Masto later said she would want Biden campaigning for her. \u201cThe President is an important part in delivering everything I just talked about\u2014from tax cuts to Nevadans and helping us overcome the pandemic,\u201d Cortez Masto said. \u201cAnd we need to continue to work together for our communities, not just in Nevada but across the country.\u201d Abortion access could come to the forefront of 2022 contests if the Supreme Court weakens or even strikes down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion, in cases next year. In 1990, Nevada passed a referendum allowing for abortions within the first 24 weeks of pregnancy, limiting the effect of the Supreme Court rulings in that state. But Democrats like Cortez Masto will be sure to attack Republicans like Laxalt for opposing abortion rights at a time when they are threatened. \u201cIn my election, I think Nevada should be asking candidates for every office what they\u2019ll do to protect these rights, and those who oppose reproductive rights should be held accountable at the ballot box as they have been before,\u201d she told CNN. Democrats argue that Biden\u2019s polling slide is only temporary, a reflection of the country\u2019s exhaustion with the two-year pandemic, and that their massive Build Back Better Act and new infrastructure bill will give them concrete policies to run on in 2022. (Republicans have already labeled the legislation out of control spending sprees that put America on the path to socialism.) Democrats also say they are prepared for what\u2019s to come; Cortez Masto raised over $3.1 million between July and September, and her campaign had over $8.3 million on hand, while Laxalt raised over $1.4 million. Megan Jones, a veteran Nevada Democratic strategist who worked on Cortez Masto\u2019s 2016 race and former Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid\u2019s campaigns, pointed to Reid\u2019s shocking 2010 victory over Republican candidate Sharron Angle, in a terrible year for Democrats. \u201cWe know how to win in Nevada,\u201d said Jones. \u201cIf they think this is the seat that the majority runs through, come and get us. We\u2019re ready to go.\u201d But Republicans dismiss the comparisons from a dozen years ago. \u201cCatherine Cortez Masto is no Harry Reid,\u201d said Robert Uithoven, a Laxalt adviser. \u201cAnd Adam Laxalt is no Sharron Angle.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "With the looming possibility of the Supreme Court gutting Roe v. Wade, the future of reproductive rights in America is poised to become a central and potentially defining issue in the upcoming midterm elections. The high court is expected to deliver its ruling on a Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks next summer, as campaign season kicks into high gear. At a hearing this week, the bench\u2019s conservative supermajority signaled its intent to uphold the law, going against decades of precedent and likely introducing a volatile new variable in electoral politics. Democratic campaign organizations up and down the ballot, along with allied abortion rights groups, are now ramping up efforts to channel the anger and anguish of pro-choice voters and drive them to the polls. On the federal level, Senate Democrats are stressing the importance of maintaining their majority in order to confirm a new justice in the event President Joe Biden has the opportunity fill a vacated seat. In the states, leading Democrats are warning that Republican victories in legislative and gubernatorial races will lead to another burst of efforts to outlaw or severely curtail abortion rights, in line with the hundreds of restrictions that have been enacted in the last decade \u2013 this time without constitutional barriers to slow or stop them. The need for Democrats to manage resources between federal and state races could create some uncomfortable conversations over the coming months. \u201cThe federal government certainly is not going to come save any of us,\u201d said Heather Williams, executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing swift action to do things like protect abortion rights, protect voting rights, to ensure that our government is looking out for people happens right at the state level. And folks need to get involved there.\u201d That, she told CNN, meant Democrats needed to be more strategic in where and how they spend. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to look at the shining star that is federal elections,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey get all the press, they get the attention. But the truth is, while those lights are shining there, the work is actually getting done in the states.\u201d Republicans have over the last few decades placed more of an emphasis on building power in the states, putting Democrats at a disadvantage they are still struggling to overcome. Republican Governors Association spokesperson Joanna Rodriguez told CNN that GOP candidates next year will have messages tailored to their electorates \u2013 and warned that Democratic attempts to nationalize the issue could have diminishing returns. \u201cIf national Democrats are going to make abortion their driving issue going into next year, they\u2019ve already lost the Kansas governor\u2019s race,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cIt won\u2019t help them in states where it\u2019s not viewed as favorably as they think it is.\u201d Abortion rights have strong support in a variety of national polling. An ABC News/Washington Post survey from last month found that 60% of Americans say Roe v. Wade should be upheld. Only 27% said it should be overturned. But that advantage, consistent through the years, has not always been reflected at the ballot, as the fervor of abortion rights opponents has outstripped that of its supporters. Democrats now are banking on a backlash fueled in large part by voters who back abortion rights, or are at least passively support a right to choose, but had not considered it a top issue in recent years due to the protections granted by Roe v. Wade. \u201cWe must defend a Democratic Senate majority with a power to confirm or reject Supreme Court Justices,\u201d said Jazmin Vargas, spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. \u201cAt the end of the day, these Supreme Court Justices make these decisions, and so we\u2019re going to make this issue salient by reminding voters of the importance of electing a Democratic Senate.\u201d Endangered Democratic incumbents like New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan are seeking to reset the stakes of their races, which could determine control of the split chamber and either open up or further dim options for Democrats after the court hands down its decision. \u201cMy potential opponents support dramatically restricting a woman\u2019s liberty by infringing upon her right to make her own health care decisions,\u201d Hassan told CNN in a statement, \u201cand I will not be shy about contrasting my record of protecting reproductive rights with their support for policies that take away women\u2019s liberty.\u201d Wisconsin state treasurer Sarah Godlewski, who is running in the Democratic Senate primary, told CNN she began to see a clear upswing in activism around abortion rights after the Supreme Court allowed the Texas law to go into effect pending potential challenges. \u201cWhen we saw the Texas ruling a few months ago, there were reproductive justice marches across the state,\u201d Godlewski said. \u201cAnd I haven\u2019t seen energy like that in a very long time, where women were organizing in places that you don\u2019t often see on issues like this.\u201d But she also expressed disappointment over the lack of action by Democrats in Washington. Like her top primary rival, Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Godlewski has pushed for Senate Democrats to ditch the 60-vote filibuster and take legislative action to protect abortion rights. \u201cI\u2019m really frustrated with my own party, to be honest, because we have the House, we have the Senate and we have the White House and we haven\u2019t codified Roe as law,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re allowing this to continue to hang by a shoestring. This issue continues to be an afterthought or an extra credit project.\u201d Chris Hartline, the top spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said it was too early to say whether the court\u2019s eventual ruling \u2013 given the range of options available to the justices \u2013 will change the broader dynamics of the campaign. But he also cast doubt on Democrats\u2019 ability, no matter what comes down, to translate it into a potent political tool. \u201cDemocrats always try to make elections about abortion and it never really seems to work. And we know with the issues that they have in terms of the political environment right now, they were going to try to find something to juice their base,\u201d Hartline said. \u201cAnd abortion seems like it might be it. That\u2019s what they\u2019re going to try. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be successful.\u201d Leading abortion rights groups and some leading progressives are also concerned that Democratic voters disillusioned by internal clashes and stalled legislative efforts by the party\u2019s majorities on Capitol Hill could blunt an electoral backlash against Republicans. \u201cCould we see a giant electoral backlash against Republicans? Yes, I think so. But the Democratic Party can\u2019t just hope that voter outrage is going to save them,\u201d Nelini Stamp, the director of partnerships and strategy for the Working Families Party, told CNN. Stamp also warned Democrats not to underestimate the possibility that conservative, anti-abortion voters, will go to the polls to reward Republicans as they push for new restrictions in the aftermath of the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cThis has been a 40-year Republican promise to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d Stamp said. \u201cSo they\u2019re also going to have people who are motivated and say, \u2018Y\u2019all got the job done.\u2019 And what do we have?\u201d Asked how Planned Parenthood Action Fund will motivate pro-choice voters who turned out in 2018 and 2020 yet feel that their vote made little difference in the fight to protect reproductive rights, Sam Lau, a PPAF spokesman, acknowledged their exasperation, but pointed to recent Democratic gubernatorial wins that put pro-choice governors in positions to protect the right to abortion. \u201cIf not for a governor who believed in reproductive freedom, those states would be looking to pass bills as radical as what we\u2019ve seen in Texas and Mississippi,\u201d Lau said. \u201cWe are at a turning point right now, and it\u2019s clear that we can no longer rely on the courts to protect our rights.\u201d Two of the highest profile 2022 gubernatorial races will take place in Michigan and Wisconsin, where Democratic Govs. Gretchen Whitmer and Tony Evers, respectively, are seeking re-election in states with Republican-held legislatures. On Friday, Evers tweeted out a picture of him at a desk, surrounded by a room of women, putting pen to paper. \u201cI just vetoed five bills that would restrict access to reproductive healthcare in Wisconsin,\u201d he wrote, adding: \u201cI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again today: as long as I\u2019m governor, I will veto any legislation that turns back the clock on reproductive rights in this state \u2013 and that\u2019s a promise.\u201d Christina Amestoy, a senior spokeswoman for the Democratic Governors Association, said she expected a campaign conducted largely in the aftermath of a Supreme Court decision to overturn or gut Roe would make it more difficult for Republican candidates to hedge or attempt to avoid the issue, as Virginia Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin did this past year. \u201cVoters deserve to know where all the candidates stand,\u201d Amestoy said. \u201cI think that (the court\u2019s decision) eliminates or prevents Republican candidates from hiding behind Roe v. Wade as a mechanism to not have to answer on the campaign trail, and only show their true anti-choice colors once I get into office.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The US Chamber of Commerce last year endorsed 23 vulnerable freshman House Democrats \u2013 the most in at least a decade \u2013 and enraged House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy and other top Republicans who accused their long-time big business allies of heresy. A year later, the Chamber is now lobbying hard against the nearly $2 trillion centerpiece of President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda, the Build Back Better bill, which those Democrats who are still in Congress backed when it passed the House this month along party lines. Now it\u2019ll be extremely difficult for those same Democrats to earn the powerful business lobby\u2019s coveted endorsement in the 2022 midterms. \u201cEarlier this year the Chamber was clear: reconciliation was a deal breaker,\u201d said Ashlee Rich Stephenson, the group\u2019s senior political strategist, referring to the sweeping bill. \u201cYou have to earn the endorsement every cycle. \u2026 Just because maybe you were supported once doesn\u2019t mean you will be next time.\u201d As the Republican coalition frayed over Biden\u2019s sweeping infrastructure law, which the Chamber backed, and remains divided over former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in the party, one element has united them in the run-up to the 2022 midterms: The Democratic bill to dramatically reshape the nation\u2019s social safety net. Conservative outside groups are planning to dump tens of millions in attack ads against vulnerable Democrats for supporting the bill, while McCarthy is trying to coalesce a conference often at loggerheads over strategy to focus squarely on the massive measure. Trump's influence looms over McCarthy's race to be next House speaker The two parties are already engaged in intense planning and strategy sessions to message the bill in the midterm elections, even before the Democratic-controlled Senate aims to pass it before Christmas. With the sharp rise in consumer prices, recent supply chain shortages, and the political fallout from the chaotic withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, Republicans are growing extremely confident about their chances to take back the House and Senate in 2022. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve felt good about flipping the House since the beginning of the year,\u201d McCarthy, who has predicted the GOP could pick up more than 60 seats, told CNN. \u201cI should buy a bigger House.\u201d Republicans have a number of reasons to be hopeful. At least 17 House Democrats are not seeking reelection in 2022 after deciding to retire or find another job. The party out of power typically picks up seats during a president\u2019s first midterm election cycle, and the redistricting process could benefit the GOP next year as well. And they now need just a handful of seats to take back a chamber where Democrats hold a 221-213 advantage. \u201cWe\u2019ll win the majority,\u201d said Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who chairs the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d Top Democrats, however, are trying to convince their members that the majority is far from lost. At a closed-door meeting at the headquarters of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee before the Thanksgiving recess, DCCC Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney of New York walked his caucus through internal poll numbers he said showed Democrats standing in an improving position in their frontline districts, according to attendees. Among the issues important to voters: dealing with the supply chain and bolstering manufacturing, taxing large corporations, and repairing roads and bridges, Democratic leaders told their members during their presentation. And the DCCC showed how some key wedge issues \u2013 abortion, the debt ceiling and prescription drug costs \u2013 could benefit their vulnerable members if they message them appropriately. Speaking to her caucus, Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and member of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s leadership team, was blunt: \u201cWe will keep the House,\u201d she said, according to an attendee. Pelosi responded: \u201cDebbie\u2019s right.\u201d Democratic leaders are worried about a replay of 2010, when they struggled to explain the Affordable Care Act\u2019s benefits and lost the House that fall. They are now instructing their members to have at least five events each in their districts to explain the elements of their sweeping agenda \u2013 the Build Back Better bill and the $1.2 trillion infrastructure law \u2013 by January as a start. \u201cPeople will know what\u2019s going to be in it,\u201d Dingell said in an interview. \u201cYou will begin to see the impact of some of it, on childcare, help to seniors. \u2026 Hopefully those things will move relatively quickly, and we need to do a good job of telling people what\u2019s in the bill.\u201d Republicans, meanwhile, see an opportunity to define what\u2019s in the bill and have ramped up their messaging operation in recent weeks. The Republican Study Committee, the largest conservative caucus in Congress, recently circulated a lengthy list of talking points to its members outlining 42 policies in the package that they claim will \u201cwreck America.\u201d The House bill would expand the social safety net and help fight climate change, while establishing free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, provide four weeks of paid family and medical leave, provide subsidies for health care and new tax credits for clean energy and electric vehicles. It would also allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs for older Americans on Medicare and support access to affordable housing. It would be partially paid for by tax increases on corporations and millionaires. Some progressives are upset that the bill doesn\u2019t include other popular proposals, including adding dental and vision benefits to Medicare and free community college, while centrists in the Senate are seeking to trim the bill even further. What remains a challenge for Democrats: Implementing many of these proposals before the 2022 midterms, especially as negotiations in the Senate over the larger bill continue to drag out. And while the infrastructure law took effect earlier this month, it takes time to pump money into public works projects and even longer for the work to be completed. \u201cOur job now as lawmakers is to make sure the money we passed in the infrastructure bill is not only getting into the states, but it\u2019s starting to be spent,\u201d Dingell said. She added: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that people who didn\u2019t vote for it don\u2019t take credit for delivering money they didn\u2019t vote for.\u201d Just 13 House Republicans ultimately voted for the infrastructure law, which McCarthy lobbied his members to oppose. But it was those GOP lawmakers\u2019 support that was essential to getting the bill signed into law, a dynamic that continues to divide the party. Rep. Chip Roy \u2013 a Texas Republican who recently tangled with McCarthy during a private conference meeting over infrastructure \u2013 expressed concern that the GOP defections undermine the Republican message. \u201cThe bottom line is, we\u2019ve got actually a whole lot of unity against the garbage the Democrats are putting out,\u201d Roy said. \u201cBut that unity only goes so far when some break and go help them pass it.\u201d Trump's revenge tour on infrastructure vote splits Republicans in West Virginia House race During a recent conference meeting, McCarthy attempted to quell brewing anger on the right over the passage of the infrastructure bill by urging Republicans not to attack each other and instead focus their ire on the Build Back Better package, according to sources in the room. Indeed, the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm sees the Democrats\u2019 massive social safety net bill as the perfect embodiment of the themes that they\u2019ve been harping on all year: rising inflation, big government and \u201ctax-and-spend liberals.\u201d They believe the culmination of those issues will help deliver Republicans the majority, even as many components of the economic package remain popular with voters. The NRCC circulated a memo this month with internal polling showing that the social safety net bill is underwater in certain battleground districts, while Republicans hold an edge over Democrats on the generic ballot \u2013 another key indicator of a party\u2019s prospects in the midterms. Dan Conston, the president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to McCarthy that is devoted to helping Republicans take back the House, noted that the average midterm pick-up in the first cycle of a president\u2019s term is 28 seats. \u201cIf you look at historical averages, that is a good indication of what is possible,\u201d he said. Conston added Biden\u2019s weakened approval rating is \u201cthe canary in the coal mine for Democrats.\u201d Fact check on Sen. Rick Scott's comments blaming inflation on government spending The conservative American Action Network ran a $14 million ad campaign this fall urging House Democrats to oppose the Build Back Better Act, according to spokesman Calvin Moore, calling the sweeping $1.9 trillion economic legislation Pelosi\u2019s \u201cspending spree.\u201d Conston said the bill will be a \u201creal liability\u201d for vulnerable Democrats since \u201cpeople already connect this overspending to inflation.\u201d But Democrats point to analysis that shows that the bill won\u2019t make inflation worse \u2013 and are betting that prices on goods ultimately will come down as the midterm season heats up and as the Covid-19 pandemic eases. Yet they agree that they need to intensify their efforts countering the GOP offensive. House Majority Forward, a nonprofit affiliated with the super PAC House Majority PAC, has already spent about $8 million to advance Biden\u2019s agenda but pledged this month to spend $20 million more. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that doing hard things will pay off politically,\u201d Maloney, the DCCC chairman, said in an interview. \u201cWe believe it will pay off in what we have achieved \u2013 and remind voters the other side will have zero ideas to help America.\u201d CNN\u2019s Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Since his first job as a young lawyer in Washington, John Roberts\u2019 work has been entangled with Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that gave women a right to end a pregnancy. He helped hoist the banner against Roe in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations. But years later, during 2005 Senate hearings for the chief justice post he now holds, Roberts testified that Roe should be respected as precedent, particularly after being affirmed in 1992. And he has largely held to that. Private SCOTUS files that could reveal what happened in Bush v. Gore remain locked up Now, Roberts, the Supreme Court and the country face a pivotal moment for abortion rights. And Roberts\u2019 action in a dispute the court will take up this week, over Mississippi\u2019s 15-week abortion ban, could be his most consequential. He leads a conservative bench that, since last year\u2019s succession of Amy Coney Barrett for Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has appeared on the precipice of reversing Roe v. Wade. Dueling parties in the Mississippi case known at Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization have laced their briefs with lines from Roberts\u2019 opinions regarding abortion rights and the value of adhering to precedent or, alternatively, discarding it. The chief justice writes with care, never leaving himself in cement, which lets both sides emphasize the words that suit their purpose. Roberts represents more than one vote among the nine. As chief, he steers the discussion. If he is in the majority, he also assigns the opinion that will speak for the court. Further, Roberts has tried to inspire public confidence in the federal judiciary and repeatedly argued that its opinions reflect justices\u2019 neutral, impartial views rather than any political instincts. Polls show that public approval of the court has dropped in recent months, notably since September 1 when the majority allowed a Texas ban on abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy to take effect even as litigation over the law that plainly conflicts with Roe v. Wade was underway. Roberts broke from his colleagues on the right wing in that case, dissenting as he wrote that the court should at least temporarily suspend the ban while courts assessed the validity of the law. The court heard oral arguments on November 1 and has yet to rule. Unlike the distinct procedural dispute in the Texas case, the Mississippi abortion controversy goes right to the heart of abortion rights, testing whether women nationwide have a right to end a pregnancy before viability. That is, when a fetus can live outside the womb, at 22-24 weeks. How the Supreme Court crafted its Roe v. Wade decision and what it means today Both Roe v. Wade, nearly a half century ago, and the decision that affirmed it two decades later, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, declared viability to be the cutoff line for when the pregnant woman\u2019s interest could be eclipsed by protection for the fetus. \u201cCasey reaffirmed \u2018the most central principle of Roe v. Wade,\u2019 \u2018a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy before viability,\u2019\u201d Roberts wrote in a 2020 Louisiana case as he quoted the 1992 decision. The question now is whether that line will hold. After graduating from Harvard law school and completing a Supreme Court clerkship with then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist, Roberts joined the Reagan administration in 1981. Reagan had campaigned on a platform against Roe v. Wade and a declaration of \u201cthe sanctity of innocent human life.\u201d His administration worked against reproductive rights in its policy agenda and court filings. Roberts, who was a junior lawyer in the Reagan Justice Department and then White House counsel\u2019s office, assumed more responsibility for the administration\u2019s legal agenda when the first President Bush came to office in 1989. Roberts became deputy US solicitor general, representing the federal government before the high court. Roberts shepherded the 1991 case of Rust v. Sullivan, as the administration argued it could forbid family planning clinics that received federal funds from providing abortion counseling. The case tested whether that prohibition impinged the free speech of physicians and other health care providers. \u201cWe continue to believe that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled,\u201d the Bush administration asserted in the brief signed by Roberts. It contended Roe v. Wade lacked any support in the Constitution\u2019s text or history. The high court had grounded the right to end a pregnancy in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process guarantee of personal liberty and relied on past cases affirming personal privacy rights. Inside the court: A historic three hours that could decide the future of abortion rights The Supreme Court ruled narrowly for the Bush administration in Rust v. Sullivan, letting the government forbid abortion-related counseling at federally funded clinics, but forgoing any new review of Roe. The following year, in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey case, justices in the majority highlighted at the outset that the Reagan and Bush administrations had argued in a total of six cases over the previous decade for reversal of Roe: \u201cLiberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt. Yet 19 years after our holding that the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to terminate her pregnancy in its early stages, that definition is still questioned. Joining the respondents as amicus curiae, the United States, as it has done in five other cases in the last decade, again asks us to overrule Roe.\u201d During Senate hearings when President George W. Bush chose him first for a US appellate court and then elevated him to the Supreme Court, Roberts said his arguments on behalf of past administrations reflected his professional advocacy and not necessarily his personal views. He also said Roe was entitled to respect under principles of \u201cstare decisis,\u201d that is, adherence to precedent. Unlike fellow conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, Roberts has declined to publicly press for reconsideration of Roe in his writings as a justice. He also has not voted as rigidly against abortion rights as Justice Brett Kavanaugh or been as personally outspoken as Barrett. Before becoming a judge, Barrett, a Notre Dame law professor, was a vocal critic of Roe v. Wade, including signing a statement that denounced Roe\u2019s \u201cbarbaric legacy\u201d and called for \u201cthe unborn to be protected in law.\u201d Roberts is a lifelong Catholic whose wife, Jane, provided pro bono legal counsel to anti-abortion nonprofit Feminists for Life. Roberts told senators in 2005 that his faith would not be a factor in his rulings. The secret Supreme Court: Late nights, courtesy votes and the unwritten 6-vote rule Two years after his confirmation, Roberts helped forge a five-justice bloc to rule that the federal government could ban an abortion procedure in which the woman\u2019s cervix is dilated and the fetus is removed intact. Critics called it \u201cpartial birth abortion.\u201d The 2007 Supreme Court decision essentially reversed a 2000 ruling that had invalidated a similar prohibition on the procedure under Nebraska law. The Supreme Court\u2019s next major abortion case came nearly a decade later, in 2016, and Roberts dissented as the majority struck down Texas requirements that physicians who perform abortions obtain \u201cadmitting privileges\u201d at a local hospital and clinics convert to costly, hospital-grade facilities. But in a 2020 dispute over similar physician credentialing requirements in Louisiana, Roberts voted against the law based on that 2016 precedent. Roberts said he still disagreed with the 2016 decision but would follow it as precedent. His rationale and key decisive vote in that case of June Medical Services v. Russo would, however, bolster states\u2019 ability to defend abortion regulations. The Mississippi case stands to transform reproductive rights. It centers not on a discrete regulation of abortion but a wholesale ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The state wants the high court to reverse the holding of Roe that protects a woman\u2019s decision to end a pregnancy before viability. Mississippi officials assert that \u201cRoe and Casey are indefensible,\u201d and they retrieve lines from Roberts\u2019 opinion in the 2020 Louisiana case suggesting the balancing of government interests and women\u2019s reproductive rights should be left to \u201clegislators, not judges.\u201d Mississippi\u2019s lawyers highlight Roberts\u2019 vote and concurring opinion in the 2010 case of Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, when the justices by a 5-4 vote reversed precedent and lifted regulations on corporate independent expenditures in election campaigns. \u201cStare decisis\u2019s \u2018greatest purpose is to serve a constitutional ideal \u2013 the rule of law,\u2019\u201d the Mississippi state lawyers write, adopting Roberts\u2019 phrasing from 2010 and arguing that \u201cadhering to Roe and Casey \u2018does more to damage this constitutional ideal than to advance it.\u2019\u201d A group of constitutional law scholars backing the Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization counter those arguments with other lines from Roberts\u2019 Citizens Union opinion, noting he wrote that \u201cFidelity to precedent\u2014the policy of stare decisis\u2014is vital to the proper exercise of the judicial function.\u201d Even as he voted to overturn precedent, Roberts had observed in that case that stare decisis promotes predictable development of the law, fosters reliance on rulings and contributes to perceptions of judicial integrity. Klobuchar on whether Supreme Court will overturn Roe v. Wade Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization itself briefly cites Citizen United as it asserts that while some may disagree with past rulings, \u201cit is critical that judicial protection hold firm absent the most dramatic and unexpected changes in law or fact,\u201d so justices not be seen as merely exercising their own preferences. Other supporters of Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, including the Department of Justice, represented by the administration of Joe Biden, revive Roberts\u2019 assertion from the June Medical Services case that \u201cfor precedent to mean anything, the doctrine (of stare decisis) must give way only to a rationale that goes beyond whether the case was decided correctly.\u201d And that is the essence of the Supreme Court\u2019s loyalty to precedent.

            "article_content": "Internal Supreme Court documents that could enhance public understanding of the Bush v. Gore election battle and other significant cases of the late 1990s and early 2000s were to be opened last year under a deal forged by a long-serving justice, but the high court has delayed release of the materials, citing the pandemic. The late Justice John Paul Stevens, whose tenure spanned 35 years, planned for most of his case files to be opened and \u201cfreely available\u201d at the Library of Congress by October 2020. His arrangement with the library \u2013 the details of which have not been previously reported \u2013 covers cases up to October 1, 2005. The secret Supreme Court: Late nights, courtesy votes and the unwritten 6-vote rule Along with the 2000 Bush v. Gore decision that continues to reverberate in election-law controversies, the trove would include documents related to two groundbreaking gay-rights decisions, a seminal University of Michigan affirmative action dispute and several post-9/11 Guantanamo detainee appeals. The release of once-private files can help illuminate one of the country\u2019s most secretive institutions, even as the open files often spawn tensions among still sitting justices. The justices keep many of their procedures confidential and all their negotiations occur behind closed doors. Historians, law professors and journalists mine the papers to understand how the nine operate. The files, which typically include draft opinions and memos written among justices, can shed light on the strategies of individual justices and nature of deliberations, why some appeals were taken, others rejected, and whether justices may have switched votes in cases heard. Such behind-the-scenes vote changes have made a difference in abortion disputes as documents from other justices\u2019 collections have revealed. The new Stevens files could reveal private conversations around a separate social policy dilemma, related to LGBTQ rights. He was the senior justice in the majority when the court in 2003 struck down a Texas ban on private sexual conduct between gay adults, and earlier in 1996, when it blocked a Colorado measure that prevented cities from passing antidiscrimination laws to protect gay people. Yet archives that augment the historical record have in the past created internal conflict. In 1993, when the papers of Justice Thurgood Marshall were opened at the Library of Congress just months after his death, then-Chief Justice William Rehnquist became furious with Library officials, questioning whether Marshall indeed wanted all his files opened so quickly. Rehnquist wrote a letter of rebuke to then-Librarian of Congress James Billington on behalf of the court majority. Rehnquist had tried but failed to induce all eight associate justices to sign the letter, but in the end had to say he was writing for a \u201cmajority of the active Justices.\u201d Some of the justices who declined to join in said they believed Marshall had wanted his papers to be released after his death. Marshall indeed had set the terms of the release of the materials that covered his tenure through 1991. John Paul Stevens: Unassuming but impactful over his 99 years Rehnquist also tried, unsuccessfully, to persuade colleagues to agree for the future to withhold private documents for set periods, for example, as long as all justices with whom an individual served had retired or died. The files of Justice Harry Blackmun, later turned over with his archive to the Library of Congress, show that Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor strongly agreed with Rehnquist in 1993 that the justices should set timelines for the release of papers. According to Blackmun\u2019s notes, the vote was 6-3 and Rehnquist did not want to impose any rule without unanimity. The three justices who voted against the proposed limits were Blackmun, Stevens and Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016 and whose files are now housed at Harvard but closed for the near future. The Supreme Court public information office said Stevens\u2019 papers were still being organized for transfer and that the Covid-19 pandemic had slowed the effort. Library officials said they have no date for when the materials would be turned over. Once in hand, the library would sort and catalog the materials for public access. Stevens, who died in 2019, finalized the agreement for his papers with Librarian of Congress Billington on January 3, 2005, Library officials told CNN. A supplemental agreement was signed on April 20, 2010, which happened to be the day Stevens turned 90 and the year he retired. He was the third longest serving justice in court history. (Billington died in 2018.) Justice Breyer: 'It's important not to have transparency' The opening of justices\u2019 archives flow from special arrangements by individual justices with the Library of Congress and various universities. The late Justice Blackmun arranged to have his extensive files opened in 2004. That move further riled sitting justices. Blackmun had saved just about everything he ever wrote or received from a colleague. Under court practice, a justice sends copies of memos directed to an individual justice during case negotiations to the whole group. Some justices plainly want greater control for posterity over the correspondence they write. Justice Stephen Breyer, in a recent conversation with CNN related to his new book, \u201cThe Authority of the Court and the Peril of Politics,\u201d said he had not yet decided whether to turn his papers over to a library. Breyer said the justices have an \u201cinformal understanding\u201d that certain documents, such as draft opinions and memoranda among justices, would be withheld from public view until after the death of other justices who served on the cases. Breyer acknowledged that such a pact might conflict with individual justice\u2019s wishes regarding their papers. The court\u2019s Public Information Office did not respond to questions about whether any formal or informal agreement for the release of confidential files is in place under Chief Justice John Roberts, who succeeded Rehnquist in 2005. The PIO also declined to answer questions related to any screening of Stevens\u2019 files or possible removal of documents. Susan Stevens Mullen, a daughter of the late justice, said she was not concerned about any culling of his files. In an email exchange with CNN, she attributed the delayed transfer of her father\u2019s materials \u201cto COVID and the impact that closures and work-from-home has had on final review and organization of the papers.\u201d The Library of Congress is also awaiting the transfer of files belonging to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Court officials said that release has also been slowed because of the pandemic. Although Ginsburg\u2019s case files are all scheduled to be housed at the Library, case files will be closed to most researchers as long as any justice who participated in the decision in the matter is alive. Stevens, a 1975 appointee of Republican President Gerald Ford, was known for an independent approach and became a leading liberal of the bench. The Chicago native whose work in Naval intelligence during World War II earned him a Bronze Star, had lone legal career, beginning with a Supreme Court clerkship in 1947-48, then becoming a specialist in antitrust law, before appointment to a US appellate court seat in 1970 and then the Supreme Court. He retired at the age of 90 and continued to write books and essays until his death at age 99. Stevens put no restrictions on his files for the Library of Congress beyond separating them into two categories: materials created before October 1, 2005, and materials created on or after that date. The first set was to be made available \u201cafter the first Monday in October in the year 2020,\u201d which would have been October 6. (Stevens\u2019 case files through 1984 can be viewed by researchers at the Library; those cover much of the ground in the files of other justices; the late 1990s and early 2000s material would likely be of most value to researchers and the broader public.) The latter batch after 2005, coinciding with when Roberts became chief justice, would not become available under the Stevens\u2019 agreement until \u201cthe first Monday in October in the year 2030.\u201d (The justices begin their annual sessions on the first Monday in October.) Stevens declined to condition the release of case files on whether justices who participated in the cases were still alive, and the gift agreement includes no exceptions or exclusions regarding the material to be donated, Library officials said. That means his files would contain correspondence with sitting Justices Breyer and Clarence Thomas and with retired living Justices O\u2019Connor, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy. The materials would also include the work of relatively recently deceased justices Ginsburg (who served 1993-2020), Scalia (1986-2016) and Rehnquist (1972-2005). Those eight justices and Stevens decided the 2000 Florida election dispute between then Texas Governor George W. Bush and then Vice President Al Gore. Their 5-4 decision, ensuring that Bush won the White House, hung over last year\u2019s election as the Donald Trump\u2019s legal team tried to rely on some of its reasoning to challenge state election practices and final results that showed Joe Biden won the presidency. Stevens, the court\u2019s senior liberal at the time, dissented in Bush v. Gore along with the other justices on the left. In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, Stevens, alternatively, was able to seize the majority for decisions that limited President Bush\u2019s assertion of executive branch power and ensured some protection for detainee rights. Stevens also led the majority in two important gay rights cases: the 1996 Romer v. Evans and 2003 Lawrence v. Texas. The papers could help explain his strategy that included assigning both cases to Kennedy, who became the voice of the court on LGBTQ interests in the years that followed, including to declare a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in 2015. Another major case Stevens shepherded during this era was Clinton v. Jones, in which the court ruled unanimously that then-President Bill Clinton could not invoke presidential immunity to avoid a civil lawsuit for alleged sexual misconduct. Justice John Paul Stevens' life in pictures The approach Stevens negotiated for his archive donation to the Library of Congress largely follows that of Marshall (1967-1991) and Blackmun (1970-1994) at the Library of Congress and Justice Lewis Powell (1972-1987), whose materials are housed at the Washington and Lee Law School. Once those files were opened, researchers could readily find documents involving still-sitting justices. Library of Congress spokesman Brett Zongker said the Library has been in contact with the Supreme Court regarding timing for a transfer of Stevens\u2019 materials, but no date has yet been given. Processing and cataloging of files would occur at the Library, and Zongker said it was difficult to estimate how long that would take. He said that first nine years of Stevens\u2019 files, through 1984, were received more than a decade ago and took less than four months to process. However, Zongker wrote that, \u201cThe Library anticipates that the remaining portion of the collection will include a greater variety of papers \u2026 relating to his entire life as well as Supreme Court case files, dockets, and other material covering\u201d Stevens\u2019 subsequent decades on the bench.",

            "article_content": "Republican Glenn Youngkin defeated Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Virginia governor\u2019s race Tuesday night, CNN projects, rolling back progressive gains in Virginia as he became the first Republican to win statewide office in the commonwealth since 2009. McAuliffe\u2019s loss in a state that President Joe Biden won by double digits last year showed the enormous challenges that Democrats are facing next year as they attempt to maintain control of the US House and Senate. McAuliffe, who served as governor from 2014 to 2018 in a state that does not allow successive terms, had struggled to find a message that would galvanize Democrats at a time when Biden\u2019s approval ratings have sagged and the party has been unable to deliver a clear message amid bickering over the President\u2019s agenda in Congress. McAuliffe conceded Wednesday morning, congratulating Youngkin and \u201cwishing the best to him and his family.\u201d He and Youngkin have not yet spoken on the phone, a McAuliffe aide told CNN, adding that the Democrat called Youngkin before he publicly conceded but the governor-elect did not pick up. Economy tops education and Covid-19 as most important issue for Virginia voters, exit poll shows Virginia and New Jersey each have a historical pattern of electing governors in off-year elections who are from the opposite party of the occupant of the White House. McAuliffe defied that pattern when he won his first term in 2013, the year after then-President Barack Obama won reelection. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy had hoped voters would reward him for his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and make him the first Democratic governor to win reelection in the state in more than 40 years. But as the ballots were counted Tuesday night, Republican Jack Ciattarelli was performing much better than expected, another warning sign for Democrats in a state Biden won by nearly 16 points. The race remains too close to call. Dana Bash reacts to CNN projection in Virginia race McAuliffe had hoped to win a second nonconsecutive term by trying to tie Youngkin to former President Donald Trump. But that strategy fell flat \u2013 failing to turn out the Democrats that McAuliffe needed to staunch Youngkin\u2019s momentum and his gains among independent voters. The dynamic provided a cautionary tale for some Democrats who had hoped to use that strategy to defeat their Republican opponents next year in the midterm races. The sour mood of voters also appeared to be a factor in the much closer than expected New Jersey governor\u2019s race. Virginia Democrats clearly underestimated Youngkin, an agile candidate who burrowed into local issues like education and fashioned himself as a champion for parental rights. The Republican successfully kept Trump at a distance but praised him early in the race \u2013 managing to avoid alienating his supporters while successfully making a play for critical voters in the Northern Virginia suburbs who rejected Trump last year. Late Tuesday night, Youngkin was exceeding the performance of the previous Republican gubernatorial candidate four years ago and also significantly outperforming Trump\u2019s margins in the Virginia suburbs, which had been trending increasingly Democratic. McAuliffe\u2019s margins, by contrast, fell below the tallies in previous contests of Biden and Virginia\u2019s current Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, in key areas throughout the state. Youngkin addressed his supporters, promising to deliver on his campaign promises on school choice and cutting some taxes in the state. \u201cWe\u2019re going to embrace our parents, not ignore them. We\u2019re going to press forward with a curriculum that includes listening to parents, as well as a curriculum that allows our children to run as fast as they can, teaching them how to think, enabling their dreams to soar. Friends, we are going to reestablish excellence in our schools,\u201d he said. He appeared briefly before his supporters late Tuesday night. \u201cWe still got a lot of votes to count,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cWe are going to continue to count votes.\u201d McAuliffe had made a gamble by centering his campaign on the notion that Youngkin was a Trump \u201cwannabe.\u201d In the final days on the campaign trail, he referred to Youngkin as \u201cGlenn Trumpkin\u201d and argued that a Youngkin win in Virginia would embolden Trump ahead of possible 2024 White House bid, but that argument does not appear to have energized Democratic voters the way McAuliffe had hoped. Youngkin tapped into some of Trump\u2019s rhetoric to appeal to the GOP base \u2013 by invoking certain culture war issues and talking about \u201celection integrity\u201d early in the race, for example \u2013 but he steered clear of the telerally that Trump held Monday night for the Republican ticket. Winsome Sears, a conservative Republican, will be Virginia\u2019s next lieutenant governor, breaking barriers as the first woman and the first woman of color in the office in the commonwealth\u2019s 400-year legislative history. The preliminary results of CNN\u2019s Virginia exit poll demonstrated the difficult headwinds that McAuliffe faced as he tried to navigate the discord within his party. Only 43% of Virginians said they approve of Biden\u2019s job performance and a narrow majority of voters described the Democratic Party as too liberal overall; while fewer voters described the Republican Party as too conservative. Virginia exit poll: Majority of voters disapprove of Biden About one-third of Virginia voters called the economy the most important issue facing the state, according to the exit poll. Just under one-quarter said education was most important, about 15% chose taxes, about 14% said the Covid-19 pandemic. Just about one-tenth chose abortion. Virginia voters held negative views of both Biden and Trump. Only about one-fifth of voters said they view their vote as a way to express support for Biden, with nearly 3 in 10 saying it\u2019s a way to express opposition, and the remaining half of the electorate saying Biden wasn\u2019t a factor. Despite McAuliffe\u2019s efforts to demonize Youngkin as a Trump warrior, who has said the former President \u201crepresents so much of why I\u2019m running,\u201d the Republican\u2019s campaign presented him as a non-threatening, fleece-vest-wearing Northern Virginia dad and businessman who coached basketball in his free time. Youngkin wooed suburban voters by digging into the GOP\u2019s culture wars \u2013 promising to protect law enforcement funding amid concerns about rising crime nationally, rejecting Covid-19 vaccine mandates for teachers and state workers, and vowing that Virginia schools will not \u201cteach our children to view everything through a lens of race.\u201d At a time when the electorate has increasingly embraced newcomers to politics, Youngkin portrayed his rival as the ultimate political insider as the former chair of the Democratic National Committee and a leading fundraiser for Bill and Hillary Clinton over decades. In a message keyed toward suburban women, Youngkin charged that McAuliffe would allow government to stand between parents and their children when it comes to education, seizing on a comment from the Democrat in a debate that he didn\u2019t think \u201cparents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d One of Youngkin\u2019s closing ads featured Fairfax County mother and conservative activist Laura Murphy claiming that a book her then-high school son was assigned to read gave him nightmares. The book, which the ad does not mention by name, was Toni Morrison\u2019s \u201cBeloved,\u201d which is about the horrors of slavery. Murphy had led a campaign against the teaching of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, leading to two bills \u2013 eventually vetoed by McAuliffe \u2013 that would have allowed parents to reject certain assignments they viewed as explicit. Democrats jumped on the ad, with McAuliffe calling it a \u201cracist dog whistle\u201d and arguing his Republican opponent was using education to divide Virginia by pitting parents against parents, and parents against teachers. McAuliffe labored against the exhaustion of Democratic voters, a more energized Republican base and Biden\u2019s waning popularity. A chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, a Covid-19 surge fueled by the Delta variant and sluggish economy have all taken a toll on Biden, who has struggled to unite his party around his agenda. Progressive and moderate Democrats in Congress have spent months wrangling over the size and scope of the President\u2019s climate and social safety net package, but even if there had been a vote on that $1.75 million economic plan and an accompanying bipartisan infrastructure by Tuesday of this week, it would have been far too late to boost McAuliffe in a state where early voting began weeks ago. Without a tangible achievement to point to from Democratic-controlled Washington, McAuliffe didn\u2019t hide his frustration. He demanded that members of Congress \u201cdo your job and quit the posturing,\u201d in an interview with CNN. The national mood has soured amid lingering fears, restrictions and frustrations related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the uncertain economic recovery. Voters are concerned about inflation, the higher prices they are paying as the holiday season approaches and supply chain bottlenecks that have disrupted the economy. The latest CNN Poll of Polls finds the President at 42% approval to 51% disapproval among US adults, and in a national NBC News poll released Sunday, 7 in 10 said the country is going in the wrong direction. Jennings: Youngkin gives GOP a blueprint on how to talk to voters again The debates featured sharp policy contrasts between the two candidates. Youngkin had argued that McAuliffe\u2019s plans for government spending were too expensive and said he would fuel an economic revival in Virginia by cutting taxes, including the \u201cgrocery tax\u201d which Youngkin says would save Virginians $1,500 in the first year of implementation. McAuliffe had promised a $2 billion investment in education \u2013 twice the amount he proposed in his first term \u2013 and touted 20 plans he had developed to lead the state out of the Covid pandemic. He also called for Covid-19 vaccine mandates for state teachers, health care workers and other essential employees, arguing that Youngkin\u2019s resistance to those measures would jeopardize the state\u2019s recovery. Youngkin said that while he has asked everyone in Virginia \u201cto please get the vaccine,\u201d he believes firing workers who do not comply with vaccine mandates could cripple the state economically. \u201cWe need people on the job. To make life difficult, that\u2019s no way to go serve Virginians,\u201d Youngkin said in the candidates\u2019 final debate. \u201cWe can do this. We can in fact protect lives and livelihoods.\u201d This story has been updated with CNN\u2019s projection. Eric Bradner and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy is locked in a closer-than-expected race that remains too close to call as he tries to become the first Democratic governor in more than four decades to win reelection in the Garden State. Like Virginia \u2013 where Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin won Tuesday night \u2013 New Jersey has trended reliably blue in federal and local contests but has a history of voting in the party out of the White House in its off-year gubernatorial races. On top of their loss in Virginia, the close race in the Garden State \u2013 where President Joe Biden also won by double digits in 2020 \u2013 is a warning sign to Democrats looking to maintain their congressional majorities in next year\u2019s midterms. With 84% of the vote in, Murphy was tied with Republican Jack Ciattarelli. Murphy\u2019s lead over Ciattarelli in a number of late polls had appeared to be at or near double digits, giving Democrats confidence about the outcome and shifting some focus to the eventual margin \u2013 and what it could portend for next year\u2019s midterm elections. Murphy\u2019s campaign acknowledges it\u2019s been a tougher evening than they had expected, but they maintain that they will pull it out in the end, believing that the outstanding votes will break for them, a Murphy adviser said. Here are the major 2021 races to watch Like Youngkin, Ciattarelli \u2013 a businessman and former state lawmaker \u2013 kept Trump at arm\u2019s length, instead hammering Murphy over taxes and what he argued were the effects of the Democrat\u2019s pandemic response on businesses. Democrats are hoping that even a narrow Murphy win will be an affirmation of the party\u2019s commitments to mask and vaccine mandates, which Murphy has championed in a state that has suffered about 28,000 Covid-19 deaths. The final Monmouth University survey of the race showed Murphy with leads ranging from 8 to 14 points, depending on different models of who comes out to vote. Those figures represent a modest narrowing of the race, in which taxes \u2013 an issue that Ciattarelli leads on \u2013 were listed as the top issue. But Murphy\u2019s advantage on the question of who voters trust more to handle the pandemic was significantly higher, 45% to 26%, a gap that has stayed mostly consistent since the summer. The Democrat also enjoys a sizable lead on a question that has roiled the Virginia race \u2013 education and schools \u2013 leading Ciattarelli by 15 points. Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by more than a million in New Jersey, though voters there have shown a willingness to support moderate GOP candidates, like two-term former Govs. Christie Todd Whitman and, before Murphy\u2019s 2017 election, Chris Christie. How New Jersey may prove some politics still is local Like in Virginia, New Jersey Democrats and the Murphy campaign have consistently tied the Republican nominee to Trump, who remains deeply unpopular in New Jersey. The complicating factor, though, is that Biden\u2019s approval in the state has sunk over the past few months. (He was 6 points underwater in the Monmouth poll.) Ciattarelli has downplayed Trump-fueled conspiracy theories over election fraud \u2013 at least as it applied to his own prospects. \u201cDon\u2019t let anybody stay home because they think we can\u2019t win or because it\u2019s rigged,\u201d Ciattarelli said at a campaign event last week. \u201cIt\u2019s not rigged here in New Jersey. We can win this race.\u201d Ciattarelli did not name Trump, but the remark underscored the headwinds created by the former President\u2019s lies about the 2020 election and the awkward dance being attempted by more traditional Republican candidates attempting to keep Trump diehards on board and get them to the polls, without alienating suburban swing voters turned off by Trump\u2019s behavior and rhetoric. At their second debate, in mid-October, a moderator pressed Ciattarelli over his view of Trump and whether he would accept the former President\u2019s support and campaign alongside him. The Republican nominee, who has been critical of Trump but backed him last year, suggested he had no plans to call in the former President, who has not appeared on the trail in New Jersey despite having a home there. \u201cI go out there and campaign on my own,\u201d Ciattarelli responded. \u201cI\u2019ll win my own election.\u201d Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs executive and ambassador to Germany who previously served as the Democratic National Committee\u2019s finance chair, has taken the opposite tack, stumping alongside a who\u2019s who of national Democratic heavyweights. Biden, former President Barack Obama and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who rallied for the governor at Rutgers University, have all headlined events for him. Obama, speaking in Newark last month, zeroed in on Ciattarelli for having previously addressed a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, then later claiming he was unaware of the event\u2019s focus. Five mayoral races to watch on Tuesday \u201cApparently Phil\u2019s opponent says, well, he didn\u2019t know it was a rally to overturn the results of the last election. Brother, come on,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen you are standing in front of a sign that says \u2018Stop the Steal,\u2019 and there\u2019s a guy in the crowd waving a Confederate flag, you know this isn\u2019t a neighborhood barbecue.\u201d Ciattarelli\u2019s camp, in response, has pointed to his past statements affirming that Biden won the election \u2013 remarks he was attacked over by other Republicans during the gubernatorial primary. In a pair of debates, Murphy also hammered Ciattarelli over the Republican\u2019s opposition to mask and vaccine mandates, arguing that the measures have been crucial in combating the Delta variant surge that ravaged a number of GOP-led states. \u201cFor folks to ignore that, disregard that (Covid response) playbook, is putting lives needlessly at risk,\u201d Murphy said during their second meeting. Ciattarelli\u2019s insistence that decisions over masks and vaccines should be a matter of personal choice, he added, \u201cfeels like an answer you\u2019d see in a debate in Texas or Florida.\u201d Murphy has also sought to spotlight concerns over the fate of abortion rights, which are under siege in GOP-led states and could be dealt a devastating blow at the Supreme Court, where the constitutional right to an abortion could soon face an existential test. Both candidates support abortion rights, a policy position that puts Ciattarelli at odds with the national GOP. But he opposes a state bill, called the Reproductive Freedom Act, that would codify Roe v. Wade and expand access by allowing more providers to perform the procedure. Passage of the bill, Murphy said in the debate, would be his \u201cnumber one agenda item\u201d when New Jersey lawmakers reconvene for their next session later this year.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden told reporters during his first news conference in months that he was encouraged by how he was received at this weekend\u2019s Group of 20 Leadership Summit in Rome, dismissing concerns that allies might not take solace in his pledge to turn the page from his predecessor, former President Donald Trump. \u201cThey listened. Everyone sought me out. They wanted to know what our views were, and we helped lead what happened here,\u201d Biden said of other world leaders Sunday evening. \u201cWe got significant support here. \u2026 The United States of America is the most critical part of this entire agenda.\u201d Back in Washington, however, the President\u2019s ambitious legislative agenda is stalling in Congress. And in Virginia, Biden-backed Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe faces a tough election on Tuesday The President also dismissed concerns that poll numbers posed a significant problem for his administration\u2019s priorities, saying, \u201cLook at every other president. The same thing has happened. But that\u2019s not why I ran.\u201d This was Biden\u2019s first solo news conference since the one he held in mid-June in Geneva, Switzerland, following a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. During the wide-ranging question-and-answer session, which lasted less than a half hour, Biden asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s really no substitute for face-to-face discussions and negotiations among the leaders to build an understanding and cooperation.\u201d The President said he \u201cfound it disappointing\u201d that the leaders of major polluters like China and Russia are not showing up at this week\u2019s international summits. Biden said it would be up to nations to deliver on their promises. \u201cThe proof of the pudding will be eating,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you\u2019re gonna see we\u2019ve made significant progress and more has to be done, but it\u2019s gonna require us to continue to focus on what China\u2019s not doing, what Russia is not doing, what Saudi Arabia is not doing.\u201d On Iran, Biden told reporters the US is \u201ccontinuing to suffer\u201d because of Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. The President also reflected on his \u201cpersonal\u201d relationship with Pope Francis, who he visited at the Vatican on Friday Biden praised Francis as \u201csomeone who\u2019s provided a great solace for my family when my son died,\u201d but he did not directly respond to a question about a proposal that tried to to permit individual American bishops to deny communion to politicians, like the President, who support abortion rights. The President\u2019s engagements with reporters have been somewhat limited throughout this first leg of his journey through Europe. While the American press was allowed to ask questions in the room with Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron before their bilateral meeting Rome, the press was entirely shut out of the President\u2019s meeting with Pope Francis. Footage of the meeting from inside the walls of the papal state was distributed by Vatican Television. The President next heads to Monday\u2019s United Nations Climate Summit in Glasgow, Scotland. Earlier Sunday, Biden signed an executive order intended to streamline stockpiling efforts as he looks for solutions supply chain logjams, part of a number of efforts taking place during his final day in Rome for the Group of 20 summit. The order delegates authority to the Pentagon to release materials from the National Defense Stockpile, which the White House says would allow for quicker response to supply shortages. On Sunday, Biden also announced increased funding to promote international supply chain resilience, which he said would help the US and international partners \u201ccut port congestion by slashing red tape.\u201d And he is directing his secretaries of State and Commerce to convene a summit next year focused on the issue. During an event he hosted on global supply chain resilience at the G20 in Rome, Biden also called on countries to renew efforts to address supply issues, particularly relating to national security. He said to the group of world leaders at the event: \u201cI urge all of you \u2026 to consider bolstering your stockpiles critical to national security in your countries. But like so many of our challenges today, it isn\u2019t a problem any one of our nations can solve through unilateral actions. Coordination is key.\u201d Biden said the real way to solve the supply bottlenecks would be ending the coronavirus pandemic, arguing that it\u2019s \u201cthe ultimate key to unlocking the disruptions.\u201d Shortages of goods have become a political liability for Biden and are contributing to inflation. He convened the special session at the G20 to address the topic, where officials say he will ask individual countries to identify ways they can shake loose the blockages. Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2021 US growth forecast by one percentage point \u2013 the most for any G7 economy \u2013 because of supply chain disruptions and weakening consumption. And as supply chain disruptions hiked prices for consumers and slowed the economic recovery, Moody\u2019s Analytics warned that the disruptions \u201cwill get worse before they get better.\u201d Moody\u2019s pointed to differences in how countries are fighting Covid-19, with China aiming for zero cases while the United States is \u201cmore willing to live with Covid-19 as an endemic disease.\u201d The firm also cited the lack of a \u201cconcerted global effort to ensure the smooth operation\u201d of the worldwide logistics and transportation network. Earlier Sunday, Biden raised concerns over Turkey\u2019s possession of a Russian missile system and human rights issues in a meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the White House said, amid simmering tensions between the two nations. The two leaders met for about 55 minutes on the sidelines of the final day of the G20 Summit, taking place this year in Rome. Turkey\u2019s acquisition of the Russian S-400 missile system was fiercely opposed by NATO and by Washington, and signaled a deepening relationship between Erdo\u011fan and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Biden addressed these concerns directly with Erdo\u011fan, a White House readout of the meeting stated, while also underscoring \u201chis desire to maintain constructive relations, expand areas of cooperation, and manage our disagreements effectively.\u201d A senior administration official told reporters after the meeting: \u201cThe President also raised human rights issues, saying that this is a set of issues \u2013 democracy, rule of law, human rights \u2013 that are important to him. And that those are issues that he and his administration will continue to raise.\u201d The two leaders also discussed regional issues, including the political process in Syria, delivering humanitarian assistance to Afghans, elections in Libya, the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and diplomatic efforts in the South Caucasus, the White House said. Biden will also hold his first solo press conference in months on Sunday. The meeting on Sunday morning with Erdo\u011fan was not previously on Biden\u2019s public schedule and was relayed Saturday evening to reporters by a senior administration official. The sit-down came about a week after Erdo\u011fan ordered 10 ambassadors \u2013 including those from the US, France, and Germany \u2013 be declared \u201cpersona non grata\u201d after they released a joint statement calling for the release of jailed Turkish businessman and philanthropist Osman Kavala. Ahead of the meeting, Biden said he planned on having a \u201cgood conversation\u201d with the Turkish President while standing beside him. Biden didn\u2019t answer questions from reporters about whether he planned to raise human rights issues or whether he believed Turkey was too close to Russia. Ahead of the meeting, an administration official told reporters in Rome: \u201cCertainly, the President will indicate that we need to find a way to avoid crises like that one going forward, and precipitous action is not going to benefit the US-Turkey partnership and alliance.\u201d The official added the two leaders are expected to discuss Libya, and their defense relationship. Biden and Erdo\u011fan last met one-on-one in June at NATO headquarters in Brussels, a meeting Biden called \u201cpositive and productive.\u201d It was a closely watched meeting after Biden in April became the first US president in decades to recognize the massacre of Armenians under the Ottoman Empire as a genocide \u2013 a move that risked a potential fracture with Turkey but signaled a commitment to global human rights. Biden skipped two of the more informal events arranged for G20 leaders during this weekend\u2019s summit in Rome. The President did not attend a performance Saturday night held in the 1,700-year-old Baths of Diocletian, where most of the other leaders were treated to a performance of Puccini under soaring stone arches. Instead, the President attended Mass at St. Patrick\u2019s Church with the first lady. On Sunday morning, many G20 leaders gathered at the Trevi Fountain and tossed coins over their shoulders into the water. Biden skipped the event, as he was about to meet with Erdo\u011fan, who also did not attend. Aside from the bilateral with Erdo\u011fan, the President met with Singapore\u2019s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong Sunday afternoon, where the two leaders \u201creaffirmed the importance of the US-Singapore Strategic Partnership and reviewed opportunities to build on the momentum generated by Vice President Harris\u2019 visit to Singapore in August,\u201d according to the White House. Biden \u201cexpressed his desire to deepen cooperation with Singapore in pursuit of our shared interests and a free and open Indo-Pacific, including in upholding freedom of the seas and advancing supply chain resiliency,\u201d the White House statement said. Biden also participated in two G20 sessions on climate and other sustainable development, according to the administration official.

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama urged voters to shake off their exhaustion with politics during his first in-person foray onto the campaign trail in 2021, telling voters in Virginia, \u201cwe can\u2019t afford to be tired.\u201d Obama, in remarks supporting Virginia\u2019s Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe, lambasted his opponent Glenn Youngkin, repeatedly mocking the Republican for a disconnect between how he casts himself and what his policies and private comments say about him. The former president also slammed Republicans for looking to curb voting, asking rhetorically, \u201cWhat are they so afraid of?\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t run ads telling me you are a regular old hoops-playing, dish-washing, fleece-wearing guy, but quietly cultivate support from those who seek to tear down our democracy,\u201d Obama said, hitting Youngkin for the Republican rally earlier this month when organizers pledged allegiance to a flag which was said to be used at the January 6 insurrection. Former President Donald Trump called into the rally, but Youngkin did not appear at the event. Youngkin, who used to run the Carlyle Group, a large private equity firm, has run a number of ads showing him in casual settings, like playing basketball or doing housework. Obama took a shot at the ads, joking, \u201cWhenever a wealthy person runs for office, they always want to show you what a regular guy they are.\u201d Obama argued the disconnect is about more than just standard politics, telling the assembled audience it shows the Republican candidate either actually \u201cbelieves in the same conspiracy theories that resulted\u201d in the January 6 insurrection or he \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe it but he\u2019s willing to go along with it to say or do anything to get elected.\u201d \u201cAnd maybe that is worse,\u201d he added, because it \u201csays something about character. And character will end up showing when you actually are in office.\u201d Later Saturday, Youngkin responded to Obama\u2019s joke about his basketball game by taping a digital ad where he challenges the former President to a game. (Youngkin, who is 6\u20197\u201d, has previously appeared in ads playing basketball and was on Rice University\u2019s basketball team for four years.) \u201cForty-four, I hear you are in town trying to bail out Terry\u2019s campaign,\u201d Youngkin says after sinking a three. \u201cIf you are up for a game, I\u2019m ready.\u201d Why Virginia is the biggest test yet for whether Trump still motivates Democrats During the Virginia rally, when McAuliffe supporters booed at the mention of Youngkin, Obama turned back to a phrase he has used throughout his political career: \u201cDon\u2019t boo, vote. Booing doesn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d Obama\u2019s appearance in Virginia is aimed squarely at turning out the Democratic base, something the McAuliffe campaign and Democrats throughout the commonwealth have been worried about in the closing weeks of the campaign. A recent Monmouth University poll highlighted these concerns: 49% of Republican voters surveyed said they were enthusiastic about the race, compared to 26% of Democrats \u2013 a 23-percentage-point chasm just weeks out from the November 2 election. Obama looked to turn around those numbers, at least in the Richmond area, a solidly Democratic city in the commonwealth where Obama won nearly 80% of the vote in 2008 and nearly 78% in 2012. \u201cI know a lot of people are tired of politics right now,\u201d Obama said, acknowledging the lack of enthusiasm among Democrats. \u201cListen, I will make a confession. I never watch political shows. \u2026 I understand why people might be tired of politics.\u201d The former president added: \u201cHere is the thing, we can\u2019t afford to be tired.\u201d Obama in new McAuliffe ad: 'Virginia, you have a lot of responsibility this year' While Obama did not directly mention Trump, McAuliffe, who spoke before Obama outside the James Branch Cabell Library at Virginia Commonwealth University, did repeatedly. \u201cGlenn Youngkin is not a reasonable Republican,\u201d McAuliffe said. \u201cI call him Donald Trump in khakis. Do we want a lapdog to Donald Trump to be our governor here in the commonwealth? No we don\u2019t.\u201d McAuliffe has looked to boost Democratic turnout in the commonwealth by nationalizing the race, comparing Youngkin to Trump at every opportunity. And he continued the focus on Saturday, arguing his opponent \u201chas to suck up to Donald Trump all the time\u201d and pledging to \u201cbe a brick wall to protect women\u2019s rights\u201d and \u201cnever allow politicians like Donald Trump and Glenn Youngkin ever to make abortion illegal here in the commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d The Richmond rally is the first on Saturday for Obama, who is slated to travel to rally for New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who is running for reelection. Both Democrats have nationalized their races to reelection, hoping to seize on continued anger at Trump in two states that backed Biden in 2020. Obama did just take in an ad he cut for McAuliffe, telling voters they \u201chave a lot of responsibility this year.\u201d \u201cNot only are you choosing your next governor, but you\u2019re also making a statement about what direction we\u2019re headed in as a country,\u201d Obama says in the ad. Out of office and off the ballot, Trump's influence still looms Obama\u2019s appearance also highlights a stark divide in the Virginia race. While McAuliffe has leaned on a stable of top Democratic talent, from Vice President Kamala Harris to Georgia\u2019s Stacey Abrams to President Joe Biden, Youngkin has largely campaigned alone, looking to avoid nationalizing the race in a commonwealth that has rejected Republicans on the statewide level for years. However, Youngkin on Saturday night put out a more resoundingly national message during a rally in Henrico, Virginia, telling supporters \u201cour nation\u2019s future rests in Virginia\u2019s present.\u201d Earlier in October, Youngkin told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, \u201cI\u2019m on the ballot, I\u2019m running against Terry McAuliffe.\u201d He added: \u201cTerry McAuliffe wants anybody but Terry McAuliffe campaigning, he\u2019s inviting the world to come in and campaign with him.\u201d Trump is the most significant reason. The former President lost the state by ten percentage points in 2020 and remains an unpopular figure, especially in vote-rich areas in Northern Virginia. McAuliffe and top Democrats in the state, even without a Trump visit, have used the former president as his primary foil in the race, looking to tie Youngkin to the polarizing Republican at every event. \u201cNot once, but twice, we have rejected Trump and his anti-science, unhinged, anti-choice rhetoric,\u201d Hala Ayala, the Democratic lieutenant governor candidate, said on Saturday. \u201cBut you know what\u2026. [it\u2019s] time for us to do it again.\u201d And voters in Richmond made clear Trump was front of mind in their decision to back McAuliffe. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get McAuliffe in the governor\u2019s position and we get Youngkin, I am afraid we are going to have another Trump invasion and this country doesn\u2019t need that,\u201d said Brenda Johnson, a 73-year-old retired educator who was born in Richmond. \u201cToo many of his principles are the same as Trump\u2019s, and we have suffered so terribly behind that administration that I\u2019m afraid for the country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas took his seat on the far end of the bench in 1991 feeling \u2013 he once said \u2013 \u201cbeat up\u201d by the workload. A bitter confirmation battle marked by allegations of sexual harassment by Anita Hill was over, but liberals still lamented the fact that a 43-year-old conservative would take the place of retired civil rights icon Justice Thurgood Marshall. Flash forward to 2021 and the most momentous term in recent history. The justices are poised to decide a major abortion case as well as broaden gun rights in a dispute out of New York. Another abortion challenge for John Roberts and the Supreme Court Thomas, now 73, sits next to Chief Justice John Roberts in a chair reserved, in this instance, not only for the longest-serving member of the court, but for a Justice who finds himself at the center of a conservative judicial movement, lauded for 30 years\u2019 worth of writing that has become, for some, currency for the future. Since 2017, three new colleagues, perhaps swayed in their views by Thomas\u2019 many opinions, have joined the bench. And Thomas, taking advantage of a revised oral argument format, has broken his historic silence and has launched the first question at every oral argument so far this term. Meanwhile, he has amassed more than 100 former clerks, and some of these faithful followers have gone on to serve in the highest level of government and the judiciary. He started a tradition of taking his law clerks \u2013 who he refers to as his \u201ckids\u201d \u2013 to the Gettysburg battlefields at the end of each term to remind them of the nation\u2019s past. Thomas \u2013 to steal a word from the Gen Z culture \u2013 is now an influencer. At an event Thursday night, hosted by The Heritage Foundation to celebrate his legacy, Thomas addressed a crowd of the conservative faithful, referencing his more difficult days, and thanking those who had helped him. He said it was \u201can absolute joy\u201d to be able to \u201ccelebrate this moment, not because of me, but because of you all and what we are trying to defend in this great country.\u201d He was introduced by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, who called Thomas a \u201clegal titan.\u201d Biden's Supreme Court commission is leaving everyone unhappy McConnell was largely responsible for pushing through President Donald Trump\u2019s nominees on the bench, infuriating liberals by blocking President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee citing the then-upcoming presidential election, but then orchestrating the nomination of Justice Amy Coney Barrett right before Trump lost. He called Thomas the \u201cbrightest possible North Star.\u201d \u201cAt the risk of sounding greedy,\u201d McConnell said, \u201cwe\u2019d like 30 more years.\u201d Thomas said he was a \u201clittle embarrassed\u201d by the attention because he\u2019s a \u201c100% introvert\u201d and he thanked \u201ccountless people I did not know\u201d \u2013 calling them \u201cangels in a very very dark time.\u201d \u201cI appreciate the senators who voted for me, all 52 of them,\u201d Thomas said to laughter. \u201cHey all you need is 50.\u201d (Thomas was confirmed by a 52-48 vote in 1991 after his nomination was very nearly derailed after sexual harassment allegations by Hill, his former employee at the Department of Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.) His remarks came after top appellate lawyers and judges \u2013 many of them former clerks \u2013 from the highest echelons of the judiciary came together in Washington to fete Thomas \u2013 only the second African American to serve on the court \u2013 and his legacy. Panelists at the event discussed his views on the First Amendment, religion and race, as well as his efforts to limit the power of federal agencies and the so-called \u201cadministrative state.\u201d They praised his adherence to the judicial philosophy called \u201coriginalism\u201d and his strongly held belief that the court is not always bound by past precedent, even if a decision has been on the books for decades. After the event he headed back to work to deal with a late-night death penalty application that was still pending. It\u2019s too early for any full opinions this term, but behind the scenes, assignments have begun. Because of his seniority, when Roberts is in dissent and Thomas is in the majority, it is Thomas who will assign the opinion. That fact alone, could shape the Chief Justice\u2019s thinking going forward. The secret Supreme Court: Late nights, courtesy votes and the unwritten 6-vote rule On September 1, a 5-4 vote created a firestorm across the country, by allowing a Texas six-week abortion ban to go into effect pending appeal, nearly nullifying Roe v. Wade in that state. In December, the court will also take up a Mississippi law that bars most abortions after 15 weeks. The state is asking the court to overturn Roe \u2013 the landmark decision that has been on the books for nearly 50 years. Thomas\u2019 vote is not in doubt. In June 2020, for example, he wrote that Roe is \u201cgrievously wrong.\u201d On Thursday, McConnell praised Thomas jurisprudence in the area. \u201cTake his jurisprudence on unborn life,\u201d McConnell said.  \u201cEvery time without fail, Justice Thomas writes a separate, concise opinion to cut through the 50-year tangle of made up tests and shifting standards and calmly reminds everybody that the whole house of cards lacks a constitutional foundation,\u201d he said. The justices will also take on a Second Amendment case, hearing arguments in November. Back in in 2008 in District of Columbia v. Heller, the court held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual\u2019s right to keep and bear arms at home for self-defense. Except for a follow-up decision two years later, the justices have largely stayed away from the issue \u2013 infuriating gun rights advocates and even some of the justices themselves. In 2017, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, Thomas expressed his frustration. \u201cI find it extremely improbable that the Framers understood the Second Amendment to protect little more than carrying a gun from the bedroom to the kitchen,\u201d he wrote. For years Thomas has urged his colleagues to take up another case, and now they have. 'There is no perfect victim': Anita Hill refuses to believe a myth that lets perpetrators off the hook This term, the court will consider New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, concerning a New York law that restricts individuals from carrying a concealed handgun in public. It requires a resident to obtain a license to carry a concealed pistol or revolver and demonstrate that \u201cproper cause\u201d exists for the permit. Residents must show that they have a great need for the license and that they face a \u201cspecial or unique danger to their life.\u201d Justices may also take up a case concerning affirmative action, if not this term, maybe next. In 2013, Thomas made his views on that issue clear. A \u201cstate\u2019s use of race in higher education admission decisions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause,\u201d he said. At the Heritage event, Thomas clerks pointed to Thomas\u2019 pattern, like in the Affirmative Action case, to express his views and hope that they will one day become majority opinions. Judge Allison Jones Rushing, a Trump nominee to the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals and a former Thomas clerk, dedicated her discussion to Thomas\u2019 influence. Stephen Breyer says now isn't the time to lose faith in the Supreme Court \u201cHe has persuaded his colleagues to come along,\u201d she said, even as recently as last term in a case where a 6-3 court, divided along familiar ideological lines, invalidated a California rule that requires charitable organizations to disclose the names of contributors. The case had been closely watched by supporters of campaign finance reform who believe the ruling could eventually lead more anonymous money to enter the political sphere. Thomas concurred in the decision saying that the \u201cright to assemble\u201d includes the right to \u201cassociate anonymously.\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the main dissent for her liberal colleagues. \u201cThat disclosure requirements directly burden associational rights has been the view of Justice Thomas, but it has never been the view of the Court \u201cshe said. It\u2019s no surprise that another former clerk, William Consovoy, is also the lead lawyer behind the affirmative action challenge making its way to the high court concerning Harvard\u2019s admission policies. Consovoy also served as President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer when he attempted to block a subpoena from New York state prosecutors for his tax returns. During the Trump administration, several former Thomas clerks held high positions. Both Neomi Rao and Gregory Katsas worked in the executive branch, and then they were appointed to serve on a powerful appeals court in Washington, DC. Jeffrey Wall served as acting solicitor general for the Trump administration and argued in favor of Trump\u2019s controversial travel ban. Another Trump nominee, James Ho, sits on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals and voted to allow the Texas six-week abortion ban go into effect. Two high-level sources say that if Trump had had the opportunity to appoint another Supreme Court justice, Ho would have been high on the list. And Carrie Severino is the president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a group that played a significant role supporting the Trump administration\u2019s nominees. How the Supreme Court crafted its Roe v. Wade decision and what it means today Thursday night, Thomas thanked them all. \u201cI love my kids,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are my kids, they spend a year of their lives with me and they never get away. I love being a part of their lives.\u201d But as many of his former clerks are moving forward to shape the law, Thomas is still laying the groundwork for issues he hopes one day will garner a majority. He has called, for instance, for the reconsideration of a landmark First Amendment case, New York Times v. Sullivan, labeling it a policy-driven decision \u201cmasquerading as constitutional law.\u201d He\u2019s suggested that Congress weigh whether laws should be updated to better regulate social media platforms. And in 2019, he explained his thinking about an Indiana abortion law that made it illegal for a doctor to perform an abortion motivated solely by the race, sex, diagnosis of Down syndrome or disability of the fetus. The court said it would leave in place a lower court opinion that had invalidated that provision of the law, following \u201cour ordinary practice\u201d of denying petitions that raise legal issues that have not been considered by other court of appeals. In a concurring opinion, Thomas agreed with the court\u2019s decision to decline to \u201ctake up the issue now.\u201d But he went on to warn his colleagues about the potential for abortion \u201cto become a tool of eugenic manipulation.\u201d He said the court \u201cwill soon need to confront the constitutionality of laws like Indiana\u2019s.\u201d Notably, this April a federal appeals court upheld an Ohio law that prohibits a doctor from performing an abortion when the doctor knows the reason is because of a fetal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The judges did not all agree on the reasoning, but laced within the 111 pages were references to eugenics, and Thomas\u2019 opinion.",

            "article_content": "Terry McAuliffe may be running against Glenn Youngkin, but his ultimate rhetorical opponent in the closing days of Virginia\u2019s off-year gubernatorial race is a Republican who lost a year ago. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a Donald Trump in khakis,\u201d McAuliffe said of Youngkin while launching his campaign\u2019s final bus tour on Friday in Arlington. And voters at McAuliffe\u2019s rally on Thursday evening with Vice President Kamala Harris clearly got the message. \u201cHe is a bad photocopy of Trump,\u201d Nelson Zaragoza, a mechanic from Stafford, Virginia, said of Youngkin, comparing him to former President Donald Trump. \u201cHe supports everything that Trump has been trying to push, he is doing the same thing.\u201d The level Democratic campaigns in Virginia have focused on Trump over the last few months has turned the off-year elections into the biggest test yet for whether the former President, who motivated historic Democratic turnout for the years he was either on the ballot or in power, still motivates the party\u2019s base to vote in extraordinary numbers. This lesson, determined by how the tight Virginia\u2019s races for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general end up on November 2, will reverberate within the Democratic Party for years, as both official party committees and outside organizations try to understand how to motivate voters after four years of Trump in the White House. If Democrats win in Virginia, they should thank Donald Trump McAuliffe, a candidate who rarely does subtlety, has not minced words about tying Youngkin to Trump, who remains unpopular in Virginia a year after losing the commonwealth by 10 points. His ads have pilloried Youngkin as a Trump acolyte, the former Democratic governor has repeatedly called him a Trump \u201cwannabe,\u201d and, in the closing weeks of the campaign, McAuliffe is warning that Youngkin and Trump are \u201crunning together\u201d and the former President \u201cwants to use this election to get him off the mat to get him ready for 2024.\u201d This nationalization has played out most notably in Northern Virginia. In cities like Arlington, Alexandria and Falls Church, lawn signs that say \u201cYoungkin=Trump\u201d dot umpteenth patches of grass, as McAuliffe hopes to engage the vote-rich and growing area of the commonwealth that dramatically turned against Trump in 2016 and 2020. \u201cDespite what some say,\u201d said Susan Swecker, chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, \u201cTrump and his agenda are on the ballot, too.\u201d The potency of this messaging is particularly important this year, with Democrats worried that their voter base \u2013 which may be exhausted by an endless stream of what they\u2019ve been told are critical elections \u2013 is now less interested in turning out for the November election. Polls have backed up these fears, with Republican enthusiasm for the race far outpacing Democratic enthusiasm. But voters like Zaragoza and others also expressed concerns on Thursday night that some of their friends were not as engaged in this race. Adina Wells, a 58-year-old woman who attended McAuliffe\u2019s rally with Harris, said many of her friends are \u201cnot as engaged\u201d in the gubernatorial race as they were in the presidential election a year earlier because \u201csome of them fail to realize that if you have somebody who supports (Trump in office), that could help him.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want him to get back in,\u201d Wells said of Trump. \u201cThat is a motivating factor.\u201d McAuliffe and Youngkin face early voting pressures in Virginia race To counter these worries, McAuliffe and his top surrogates have been looking to motivate Democrats with base-boosting issues like abortion and what they see as a responsible response to Covid-19 while warning that a win for Youngkin would be a win for Trump \u2013 who has not campaigned here for the Republican nominee. \u201cDemocrats still get fired up about Trump,\u201d said David Turner, a top operative at the Democratic Governors Association, adding that the messaging is particularly important \u201cwhen turnout is uncertain, and we need to motivate people to go out and vote.\u201d Renae Schumann, a voter who stopped by the early voting office in Chesterfield County last week to cast her ballot for McAuliffe, is one of those voters. \u201cAbsolutely he is on the ballot, too,\u201d Schumann said of Trump. \u201cIf you are not actively against him, I feel like you\u2019re for him. In no way has Youngkin showed or stated that he\u2019s against him, so in my mind it\u2019s clear.\u201d Youngkin has notably looked to localize the race, fighting against nationalizing it in a state that has moved away from Republicans in recent federal elections. \u201cI\u2019m on the ballot, I\u2019m running against Terry McAuliffe,\u201d Youngkin told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny recently. \u201cTerry McAuliffe wants anybody but Terry McAuliffe campaigning, he\u2019s inviting the world to come in and campaign with him.\u201d And his campaign argues recent polls showing the race a dead head are the result of McAuliffe making \u201chis campaign all about the past, while Glenn Youngkin focused on his positive vision for the future.\u201d \u201cNow McAuliffe is sinking and desperate, which is why he is calling in a failed presidential candidate from California to campaign with him,\u201d Youngkin spokesperson Christian Martinez said of the Harris visit. \u201cWe\u2019ve said from the beginning that the only person excited about McAuliffe is McAuliffe, and we\u2019ve been proven right.\u201d Republican candidates can ignore Trump -- but he won't go away Democrats often cite California as proof that focus on Trump in an election works. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, successfully fended off a recall attempt by continually hitting his Republican opponent, Larry Elder, as a Trump acolyte in a state that overwhelmingly rejected the former President nearly a year earlier. But Biden won California by nearly 30 points. The Golden State, which has a nearly two-to-one Democrat to Republican voter registration advantage, is not Virginia, making the November 2 contest the most notable test of Trump\u2019s ability to turn out Democrats ahead of the 2022 midterms. And while New Jersey also had a gubernatorial race on November 2, the state is also far bluer than Virginia. \u201cIf Trump\u2019s influence had truly died out on January 21st, 2021, you might see a very different campaign today,\u201d said Geoff Burgan, a top strategist for the Democratic Attorneys General Association. \u201cBut what we know is that Trump and a lot of Republicans, including the statewide ticket in Virginia, have doubled down on the Big Lie, sham audits and questioning the fundamentals of democracy.\u201d Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring, a Democrat, has run ads tying the Republican attorney general candidate Jason Miyares to Trump and one of the groups that helped fund the rally around the January 6 insurrection. Burgan added: \u201cDonald Trump is one of Democrats\u2019 most potent turnout weapons. No doubt about it.\u201d That is why Democrats seized on a recent Republican rally in Virginia where Trump called into the event and lauded the Republican nominee as a \u201cgentleman\u201d and someone he hopes \u201cgets in there.\u201d McAuliffe wasted no time jumping on the event, turning it into an ad and a potent fundraising tool that helped raise over $2 million, according to his team. Youngkin\u2019s strategy \u2013 focusing on local issues like education and the economy and less about national trends \u2013 is reminiscent of what Republicans did in New Jersey in 2009, where Democrats looked to turn the gubernatorial race into a referendum on former President George W. Bush and leaned on then-President Barack Obama, who had just recently carried that state by over 15 percentage points in 2008. Republicans also won the Virginia governor\u2019s mansion that year. \u201cYoungkin clearly wants this to be a race that is decided on state and local issues and Democrats want it to be about federal issues. But that is what you would usually see in a very blue state,\u201d said Mike DuHaime, who worked as the lead strategist on former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s successful 2009 campaign. Like Youngkin, Christie brought in few surrogates at all and DuHaime said the campaign declined visits by former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin because they wanted to avoid a nationalized contest in a blue state. The biggest difference between 2009 and now, however, is the antipathy for Trump. McAuliffe fights to engage politically exhausted Democrats in close of Virginia campaign The strategy \u201cshows the ideology shift of Virginia more than anything else,\u201d said DuHaime. \u201cBut Trump is very different than George W. Bush. Trump wants to stay in the center of things. George W. Bush faded away and for as unpopular as Bush was, there is a difference between being unpopular and hated vitriolically.\u201d Even as McAuliffe makes running against Trump central to his campaign, there are some concerns among Northern Virginia Democrats that warnings about Trump are not as potent as they once were with the former President out of office. Rep. Don Beyer, who has represented much of Northern Virginia since 2015, said all that has been accomplished in Virginia over the last eight years is \u201cat risk with a person who at least half of him aspires to be a Donald Trump acolyte.\u201d But, he added, there are concerns that people are less focused on opposing Trump than they were when he was on the ballot. \u201cThe further we get from the Trump presidency,\u201d he said, \u201cthat naturally is going to fade.\u201d And it is something McAuliffe has long been concerned about \u2013 openly worrying in an interview with CNN in June, shortly before he won the commonwealth\u2019s Democratic primary, that Trump\u2019s potency could be waning. \u201cWe had Donald Trump here for four years. He drove Democratic term. Donald Trump is not president anymore,\u201d McAuliffe told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very close. \u2026 This is going to be a battle.\u201d Outside political groups working in Virginia, like Swing Left, a group that formed in the wake of Trump\u2019s election in 2016, tell CNN that they have seen no drop off in engagement ahead of the off-year elections. Ryan Quinn, the group\u2019s campaigns director, said their affiliated organization Vote Forward, a group that sends letters directly to voters urging them to get out and vote, has seen four times as many letters written this year than in 2019 when the group was focused on legislative races in the commonwealth. And that Swing Left has made four times as many calls to voters in Virginia this year, too. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen a level of drop-off of enthusiasm,\u201d Quinn said, adding that people know \u201cwhat we\u2019re talking about in Virginia is not just the direction of the state, but also the direction of the overall electoral narrative going into a midterm cycle.\u201d \u201cWhile it was special that we were able to flip the state in 2019,\u201d Quinn concluded, \u201cthis clearly has much greater national import going into the 2022 cycle.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story mistakenly stated the year of Donald Trump\u2019s election. He was elected in 2016.",

            "article_content": "This is a crucial time for the reconstituted Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts, a bench still finding its bearings, seeing public approval drop and facing new scrutiny over its operations and lack of transparency. The Department of Justice on Monday asked the court to halt a near-total ban on abortion in Texas. The justices\u2019 prior action in a related case permitted the prohibition to take effect seven weeks ago in the country\u2019s second more populous state. The future of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that made abortion legal nationwide, hangs in the balance. And the institutional stakes are equally significant. The conflict at this stage of the Texas litigation hinges on the role of the federal judiciary \u2013 including the high court nine \u2013 to vindicate constitutional rights. Justice Department asks Supreme Court to block Texas' 6-week abortion ban \u201cFor half a century, this Court has held that a state may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability (when the fetus can live outside the womb),\u201d Department of Justice lawyers said in their Monday filing, emphasizing that the Texas law \u201cdefies those precedents\u201d by banning abortion before many women would even realize they were pregnant. \u201cThe question now is whether Texas\u2019s nullification of this Court\u2019s precedents should be allowed to continue while the courts consider the United States\u2019 suit,\u201d DOJ added. The Supreme Court gave Texas officials until noon Thursday to respond to the effort to block the law, which has been in effect since September 1 and has forced Texas women to travel to Oklahoma and other nearby states for abortions. The justices on Monday also asked Texas officials to respond to the separate lawsuit from abortion clinics asking the high court to hear the merits of the litigation. Monday\u2019s order expediting consideration of the clinics\u2019 case, pending for several weeks, could be a sign that the justices are ready to deeply reevaluate abortion rights in America, perhaps expanding a Mississippi abortion dispute already pending this session. The Texas clinics have asked the justices to resolve whether the state can evade federal court review by delegating enforcement of the abortion ban to the general public. Read: DOJ filing to Supreme Court to block Texas abortion law However they decide to act in upcoming days, the integrity of the justices\u2019 own institution is on the line. Their earlier action on September 1, spurning a plea by Texas clinics to block the law, unsettled the landscape of reproductive rights, as well as the justices\u2019 image in the public eye. The Department of Justice\u2019s new and forceful plea for intervention offers Roberts another chance to persuade his colleagues to take a more deliberative approach to a subject that incites cultural, social and religious passions. The justices already had scheduled oral arguments for December over a Mississippi law that forbids abortions after 15 weeks. The Texas law prevents an abortion if a fetal heartbeat is detected, which usually occurs around six weeks. The question in the Mississippi dispute is whether all bans on abortion before viability are unconstitutional. The secret Supreme Court: Late nights, courtesy votes and the unwritten 6-vote rule The court\u2019s September 1 decision fell along 5-4 ideologically charged lines. The majority\u2019s one-paragraph order, issued at midnight, without the usual briefing or oral arguments, undermined nearly a half-century of privacy rights decisions and intensified scrutiny on their internal procedures. A consistent line of cases, beginning with Roe v. Wade, have prevented government from forbidding abortion before fetal viability, estimated at about 22-24 weeks. The justices in the majority on the Texas case declared that the clinics had failed to show women would be \u201cirreparably injured\u201d if the law were allowed to take effect. They emphasized that they were not deciding the overall merits of the case and acknowledged \u201cserious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law.\u201d In the majority were Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, along with the three appointees of former President Donald Trump: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Trump vowed to appoint justices who want to overturn Roe, and while none of the three has yet to cast an up-or-down vote on Roe, they each have disparaged the high court\u2019s precedents through statements on or off the bench. Biden's Supreme Court commission is leaving everyone unhappy In dissent, Roberts, along with the three remaining liberals, had urged colleagues to put a hold on the \u201cnot only unusual, but unprecedented\u201d law, cleverly written to shield it from judicial scrutiny. The Texas statute empowers private citizens to sue anyone who assists a woman seeking to obtain an abortion and prevents state officials themselves from enforcing the ban, so they are shielded from liability. \u201cThe desired consequence appears to be to insulate the State from responsibility for implementing and enforcing the regulatory regime,\u201d Roberts wrote in his dissent. \u201cI would grant preliminary relief to preserve the status quo ante \u2013 before the law went into effect \u2013 so that the courts may consider whether a state can avoid responsibility for its laws in such a manner.\u201d Liberal justices objected with more passion. \u201cThe Court\u2019s order is stunning,\u201d wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor. \u201cPresented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of Justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand.\u201d Justice Elena Kagan noted that the justices had acted in the case \u201cwithout full briefing or argument, and after less than 72 hours\u2019 thought.\u201d SCOTUS changed oral arguments in part because female justices were interrupted, Sotomayor says She added that the majority\u2019s action was \u201cemblematic of too much of this Court\u2019s shadow-docket decisionmaking \u2013 which every day becomes more unreasoned, inconsistent, and impossible to defend.\u201d The haste and lack of transparency related to the justices\u2019 emergency procedures, dubbed the \u201cshadow docket,\u201d is one of the subjects being studied by President Joe Biden\u2019s commission on the Supreme Court. That panel will not make formal recommendations for change, yet its overall attention on the court has added to the growing public scrutiny on its operations. Gallup reported last month that the Supreme Court\u2019s job approval rating dropped nine points since July, to 40% of Americans approving of the job the justices are doing. That poll was taken in early September, after the justices first let the Texas abortion ban go into effect. Other recent polls have shown that fewer than one-third of Americans want Roe v. Wade overturned. In the Department of Justice\u2019s request on Monday, Acting US Solicitor General Brian Fletcher pointed up the distinct role of the federal government to protect rights, especially as Texas has thwarted \u201cthe mechanisms of judicial review long recognized by Congress and this Court.\u201d If the Texas law prevails, Fletcher warned, \u201ca state could effectively nullify any constitutional decision of this Court,\u201d including, he noted, to ban handguns in the home (contrary to Second Amendment rights under District of Columbia v. Heller) or prohibit corporate campaign advertising (contrary to First Amendment rights under Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission). \u201cTexas is not the first state to question Roe and Casey,\u201d Fletcher wrote, referring to the 1973 landmark and the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision that affirmed it. \u201cBut rather than forthrightly defending its law, Texas took matters into its own hands by crafting an \u2018unprecedented\u2019 structure to thwart judicial review.\u201d Texas state officials, scheduled to elaborate on their position by Thursday, argued in lower courts that the federal government lacks grounds to challenge the abortion ban. They stressed that the prohibition involves conduct between private parties and maintained the government cannot sue states to vindicate individual abortion rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. A US district court judge in Texas ruled for the Department of Justice earlier this month, producing a 113-page opinion that declared Texas had pursued an \u201caggressive scheme to deprive its citizens of a significant and well-established constitutional right. From the moment (the law) went into effect, women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution. That other courts may find a way to avoid this conclusion is theirs to decide; this Court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right.\u201d A federal appellate court reversed the effect of that order and reinstated the law. The 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined in an October 14 order to address the merits of the DOJ position, citing its prior court action against the Texas abortion clinics. Now, as the Supreme Court weighs the newest plea to intervene, in US v. Texas, the justices may agree to block the abortion prohibition until the merits of a challenge can be heard. Or the court may let the ban remain in place, intensifying the firestorm and again rewarding Texas for a legal framework intended to avoid the scrutiny of judges. Either way, the justices\u2019 action in upcoming days is likely to represent a prelude to the justices\u2019 ultimate resolution of Roe v. Wade\u2019s fate, which their recent moves have thrown in doubt.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Senate contenders in some of the most competitive races announced big fundraising hauls this week \u2013 as they prepare for a costly battle to preserve their party\u2019s razor-thin majority in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock, considered one of the Democrats\u2019 most vulnerable incumbents, raised more than $9.5 million during the third quarter of this year, his campaign manager Quentin Fulks announced Friday. Warnock\u2019s haul \u2013 one of the largest of any Senate candidate \u2013 far outpaces his best-known Republican rival, former football star Herschel Walker. Walker raised $3.7 million in five weeks, according to spokeswoman Mallory Blount. Walker entered the race in late August with the encouragement of former President Donald Trump. Warnock, the state\u2019s first Black senator, ended the quarter with more than $17.2 million in available cash remaining in his campaign account \u2013 as he seeks a full, six-year term in the Senate after winning a special election runoff earlier this year. That\u2019s more than any Georgia Senate campaign has ever reported at this stage in the election cycle, Fulks said. Warnock\u2019s total was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In Arizona, Sen. Mark Kelly, another endangered Democrat seeking a full term, brought in $8 million in total receipts during the third quarter, his campaign announced. (The total includes a refund from a campaign vendor.) But he is expected to report nearly $13 million in available cash for what likely will be one of the most expensive Senate contests of the 2022 election cycle. Herschel Walker cancels fundraiser with supporter who had swastika-shaped image in Twitter profile The midterms are more than a year away, but the stakes are enormous. The ability of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration to advance his agenda hinges on whether Democrats can retain control of Congress. Republicans need a net gain of just one seat to win the Senate majority in 2022. In the House, the GOP will take the majority if they net five seats. In addition, Democrats face the headwinds of history: The party of a first-term president typically loses ground in Congress in midterm elections. Warnock and Kelly, fresh off recent special election victories, have \u201csolidified their status as fundraising juggernauts,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of Inside Elections. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they are not going to lose because of lack of resources.\u201d But while \u201cfundraising is important, most strategists would take a favorable political environment over money any day of the week,\u201d he added. Other fundraising standouts in the July-to-September fundraising quarter include Florida Democratic Rep. Val Demings, who is hoping to face Republican Sen. Marco Rubio next fall. She announced bringing in $8.4 million during the third quarter, surpassing the $6 million the Rubio campaign collected during the same period. In Nevada, another key battleground for control of the Senate, first-term Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto raised nearly $3.2 million in the fundraising quarter and about $14 million in total this year for her reelection bid. Adam Laxalt, a former Nevada attorney general who entered the race for the Republican nomination in August, raised roughly $1.4 million in his first six weeks as a candidate, according to numbers released earlier this week. Laxalt has the backing of both Trump and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, but another Republican, Sam Brown, said he came close to that haul, collecting $1 million. In New Hampshire, first-term Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan raised nearly $3 million and ended September with roughly $6.5 million in cash reserves, according to her filing with federal regulators. She also spent heavily during the three-month period \u2013 plowing more than $1.5 million into media buys alone, well ahead of next year\u2019s general election. If New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu enters the race for the Republican nomination, as expected, the contest is likely to become one of the marquee Senate battles of the cycle. \u201cDemocrats\u2019 massive fundraising shows the strength of our candidates\u2019 grassroots support, and the enthusiasm that exists for Democrats\u2019 work in the Senate,\u201d Jazmin Vargas, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement to CNN. But Republican Party officials said the early Democratic financial advantages do not predict electoral outcomes. In 2020, for instance, Democratic challengers in states such as Kentucky and South Carolina shattered fundraising records but lost their bids to take out sitting Republicans by wide margins. \u201cCandidates from both parties will have plenty of money to get their message out this cycle,\u201d said T.W. Arrighi, national press secretary for the Senate Republicans\u2019 campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cBut Democrats will have to spend that money attempting to cover up the failures of President Biden and Senate Democrats.\u201d In this cycle, Democrats also are looking to open seats now held by Republicans in competitive states as one way to expand their narrow hold in the Senate. In North Carolina, where multiple GOP candidates are jockeying for the nomination to replace retiring Republican Sen. Richard Burr, two Republicans vying for the seat \u2013 former Gov. Pat McCrory and Trump-endorsed Rep. Ted Budd \u2013 each raised about $1 million in the quarter, their filings show. Cheri Beasley, a Democrat running for the Burr seat, announced Friday that she had collected more than $1.5 million to lead the field in fundraising over the three-month period. Beasley, a former chief justice of the state\u2019s Supreme Court, has drawn endorsements from national groups with big donor networks, including EMILY\u2019s List, which works to elect Democratic women who back abortion rights. To help counter the early fundraising strength of individual Democratic candidates, Republican outside groups have begun to put big dollars behind the effort to take the Senate majority. This week, an advocacy group affiliated with McConnell began a $10 million advertising campaign to hammer three Democratic incumbents \u2013 Kelly, Cortez Masto and Hassan \u2013 over Democrats\u2019 domestic policy plans. The ads cast a Democratic policy bill still being hashed out on Capitol Hill as imposing \u201cthe largest tax increase in decades.\u201d In Arizona, one of the Republicans vying for the chance to take on Kelly in the general election, Blake Masters, raised about $1 million in the third quarter. But Masters has the backing of a super PAC, called Saving Arizona PAC, funded by his boss, Peter Thiel, the billionaire tech entrepreneur. It already has begun advertising on his behalf and blasting another Republican seeking the nomination, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich. Masters runs Thiel Capital and the Thiel Foundation. Some Republican candidates brought in substantial sums, too. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, viewed as a potential candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2024, raised more than $8.3 million in the third quarter for his reelection bid in a safe Republican seat, new filings with the Federal Election Commission show. He ended September with nearly $19 million in available cash. Any remaining funds from his Senate bid can be transferred to a presidential campaign account should he decide to run for higher office. Federal candidates face a Friday deadline to report their fundraising and spending during the third quarter of 2021. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will meet with Pope Francis during their trip to Rome later this month for the G20 conference, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement. \u201cThey will discuss working together on efforts grounded in respect for fundamental human dignity, including ending the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling the climate crisis, and caring for the poor,\u201d Psaki said in a statement. Biden, a lifelong devout Catholic who attends weekly Mass meeting, will meet the Pope in Vatican City on October 29, Psaki said. The G20 Leaders\u2019 Summit is taking place from October 30 to October 31 in Rome. The meeting will come amid a debate within the US Catholic Church over granting communion to Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, including the nation\u2019s second Catholic President. Biden had been denied the sacrament once in 2019 in the run-up to the election and the issue drew new attention in June when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops proceeded with a plan that could deny communion to such public figures, setting up a potential public rebuke of the President. The Pope said last month that bishops debating whether to deny communion to public figures who support abortion rights should make their decisions from a \u201cpastoral\u201d viewpoint and not a political one. \u201cThe problem is not theological, it\u2019s pastoral,\u201d Francis told reporters. \u201cHow we bishops deal with this principle. We must be pastors, also with those who are excommunicated. Like God with passion and tenderness. The Bible says so.\u201d Biden has said he is personally opposed to abortion but does not believe he should impose his views on the rest of society. The President often wears his late son Beau\u2019s rosary on his wrist and frequently speaks about the important role that his faith plays in his life, particularly in carrying him through grief. Biden\u2019s first wife and infant daughter were killed in 1972 in a car crash right after he had won his US Senate seat. Beau Biden, an Iraq War veteran who served as the attorney general of Delaware, died in 2015 from brain cancer at the age of 46. Biden\u2019s faith was woven into his messaging during the 2020 presidential campaign. His speeches, particularly during the campaign, often included quotes from Scripture and Catholic hymns, as well as references to the nuns and priests from whom he learned in school. During the 2020 Democratic primary, Biden dropped his long-held support for the measure that blocks federal funds from\u00a0being used for most abortions, called the Hyde Amendment. Biden said at the time that he changed his mind because Republican state lawmakers had enacted laws making access to abortions more difficult for women who cannot afford the procedure or travel to obtain it. More recently, Biden said last month that a Texas state law\u00a0that bans abortion\u00a0after as early as six weeks into pregnancy\u00a0is \u201calmost un-American,\u201d and called it an \u201cunprecedented assault on a woman\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d as guaranteed by Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision that affirmed the legality of a woman\u2019s right to have an\u00a0abortion. This story has been updated with additional background information.",

            "article_content": "A 36-member commission set up by President Joe Biden to study the US Supreme Court is set to release draft materials on Thursday, the White House announced. The Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States was established in April partly as a compromise with liberals, who called for the expansion of the number of justices on the conservative-dominated Supreme Court \u2013 dubbed \u201ccourt packing\u201d by critics. Biden brought up the idea of creating the commission while campaigning for president, as he was being pressured by fellow Democrats to take a stand on court expansion to try to bring greater balance to a bench dominated 6-3 by conservatives. The court appears poised to continue its right turn on abortion rights, religious liberty and voting restrictions. But according to the White House, the commission is examining far more than just expanding the bench. White House establishes commission to study the Supreme Court -- but it won't make final recommendations for reform White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced the upcoming release of the commission\u2019s \u201cdraft preliminary discussion materials\u201d during Wednesday\u2019s press briefing, telling reporters the materials have not been submitted to the White House for edits or feedback. She added that the materials\u2019 release will be followed by a public meeting of the commission on Friday. \u201cOur objective here is to allow this process, made up of a diverse range of experts and voices, to move forward and represent different viewpoints and we\u2019re not going to comment on it \u2013 or the President wouldn\u2019t comment on it \u2013 until a report is final and he has the chance to review it at that period of time,\u201d Psaki said. A final report will be submitted to Biden in mid-November. The White House has previously said that \u201cthe commission\u2019s purpose is to provide an analysis of the principal arguments in the contemporary public debate for and against Supreme Court reform, including an appraisal of the merits and legality of particular reform proposals,\u201d adding that commissioners would examine such options as term limits for justices; changing the size of the court; and altering its case selection, rules and practices. The commission is not expected to make final recommendations for reform. Many Democrats also remain incensed that Senate Republicans blocked the 2016 Supreme Court nomination of then-US Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland for nearly a year, but then moved swiftly to confirm President Donald Trump\u2019s appointees, including Amy Coney Barrett just days before the November 2020 presidential election. Biden signaled on the campaign trail that he\u2019s \u201cnot a fan\u201d of court packing. While discussing his idea to form a commission, Biden told CBS News last fall that he wanted \u201crecommendations as to how to reform the court system because it\u2019s getting out of whack.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about court-packing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a number of other things that our constitutional scholars have debated. \u2026 The last thing we need to do is turn the Supreme Court into just a political football, whoever has the most votes gets whatever they want. Presidents come and go. Supreme Court justices stay for generations.\u201d CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court appeared inclined Tuesday to allow a Kentucky Republican attorney general step in to defend a controversial state abortion law after the state\u2019s Democratic governor declined to continue doing so. At issue in the case is a law that restricts a standard second-trimester abortion method known as \u201cdilation and evacuation\u201d that is used after 15 weeks of pregnancy. It was signed into law in 2018 but has so far been blocked by the courts. The justices aren\u2019t directly considering the constitutionality of the law. Instead, the dispute involves a procedural issue: whether the attorney general can revive a challenge to the law after other state officials said they would no longer pursue an appeal. Kentucky is one of several states where attorneys general are elected \u2013 giving rise to potential conflicts if the governor of a state is of a different party. If the justices were to rule in favor of the state\u2019s attorney general in the case at hand, abortion providers are concerned it would trigger more attempts to defend abortion laws when state officials are from opposing parties. Advocates fear Texas and Mississippi abortion laws will worsen the Black maternal health crisis Tuesday\u2019s arguments take place as the justices are already dealing with the issue of abortion on other fronts and Republican-led states are pushing to limit abortion rights across the country. Not only did a 5-4 court allow the Texas law to take effect pending appeal on September 1, but the court will hear arguments in December in a case where Mississippi is asking the Supreme Court to overrule Roe v. Wade. The Kentucky law has already had a complicated procedural background. It was signed by Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, and immediately challenged by EMW Women\u2019s Surgical Center \u2013 and two of its doctors. They filed suit arguing the law imposed an undue burden on the right to pre-viability abortion. At the time, Attorney General Andy Beshear, a Democrat, said his office did not have the authority to defend the law and he agreed to be bound by the decision of the state\u2019s secretary of state. After a five-day bench trial, a district court blocked the law, and the case went to the federal appeals court. At the same time, however, an election occurred and Beshear became governor. In the same election, Daniel Cameron, a Republican, was elected attorney general. After the appeals court affirmed the district court, the divide between the parties opened. The Beshear administration said it would not appeal the decision. Why it matters that Supreme Court justices can look each other in the eye again That prompted Cameron moved to intervene in the case, attempting to revive the dispute, only to lose when the federal appeals court said his request came too late. The lower court emphasized that the office of the attorney general had already agreed to step out of the case, and now it was too late to try to step back in. Cameron appealed to the Supreme Court. Kentucky\u2019s Principal Deputy Solicitor General Matthew Kuhn told the justices that as a matter of Kentucky law, Cameron has the final say on whether to accept a decision that enjoined a state law, and that even under the previous attorney general, the office had preserved the ability of the attorney general to \u201cparticipate in any appeal.\u201d He said Cameron \u201chad the ability to protect Kentucky\u2019s interests when it became unrepresented\u201d and that the decision to defend the law represented a \u201chand off\u201d from one state official to another. In court Tuesday, justices on both sides of the political spectrum questioned the lower court\u2019s decision, and seemed inclined to allow the case to continue. The ACLU\u2019s Alexa Kolbi-Molinas stressed that the office of attorney general had already spoken on the law and that Cameron stands in the \u201cshoes of his predecessor.\u201d \u201cIntervention is not a revolving door,\u201d she said, and added that the lower court did not abuse its discretion by holding that Cameron\u2019s attempt to get into the case came too late. But Justice Stephen Breyer suggested that Cameron should at least be able to back to the lower court to make his case. \u201cThere have been a lot of party changes, \u201d Beyer noted. And Chief Justice John Roberts said that even though the office of attorney general had said before the district court that it would not defend the law back then, it was \u201cnot necessarily\u201d the \u201clast word.\u201d He noted that after the election, the change of parties reshuffled the deck. Justice Elena Kagan, too, expressed concern about \u201cnobody\u201d being able to defend the law. Opponents of the law say that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision will be limited to whether the appeals court was correct to block Cameron from reviving the dispute. But because the issue touches on abortion, they fear a loss could lead to Kentuckians losing access to abortion if Cameron were ultimately to prevail.",

            "article_content": "Virginia Democrat Terry McAuliffe has admitted President Joe Biden\u2019s political woes drag on his gubernatorial campaign. But they pale against the shockwaves that would rip through the White House if he loses his race next month at a perilous time for the party in Washington. If Republican Glenn Youngkin triumphs in a margin-of-error tussle in the commonwealth, already alarmed Democrats would tip into full-on panic about next year\u2019s midterms, when their party faces a historical disadvantage as the party in the White House. The devastating blow would swell doubts about Biden\u2019s own political authority and capacity to drive an endangered agenda through Congress with a spending and debt cliff looming in December. And Youngkin, a wealthy former private equity executive, would trigger an inquest among Democrats over whether tarring GOP candidates with the polarizing aura of Donald Trump \u2013 as McAuliffe has done incessantly \u2013 will be quite so potent when they\u2019re not running in deep blue states like California and when the ex-President is not on the ballot. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, the once and possible future Virginia governor tried to explain why the race is so close in a state where Biden thrashed Trump by 10 points only 11 months ago. Black voters were central to Terry McAuliffe winning Virginia in 2013. Will they help him again? \u201cThis is an off-off-year. If you look at the history of Virginia, it\u2019s not a presidential year turnout. Turnouts go from like 70 percent down to somewhere in the 40s,\u201d said McAuliffe, who won a close gubernatorial election in 2013, a year that followed a Democratic White House win. \u201cListen, we\u2019re going to win this race because I\u2019m right on the issues,\u201d McAuliffe told Dana Bash. Pundits sometimes over-interpret individual races, trying to extrapolate from them the results of future elections elsewhere while ignoring their idiosyncrasies. But a Democratic defeat in what has become a reliably blue state over the last decade would be impossible to ignore and would cause political headaches for Democrats that reach beyond the Biden presidency. Republicans have struggled in recent years to balance the increasingly populist and nationalist leanings of the pro-Trump base with a need to appeal to highly educated, affluent voters in the suburbs. The task is especially hard in the Northern Virginia suburbs around Washington, DC, which teem with federal workers and highly educated and affluent voters. But if Youngkin can thread the needle, the wider political world will take note. \u201cEvery gubernatorial election in Virginia is seen as a leading political indicator. How the parties do in Virginia\u2019s governor\u2019s race, the year after a presidential election, is seen as a harbinger of how the parties will do in the midterm elections,\u201d said Stephen Farnsworth, a professor of political science at University of Mary Washington in Virginia. McAuliffe is a long-time friend of Biden, who endorsed him in the primary, and he shares the President\u2019s moderate leanings. His victory in a Democratic primary over more progressive rivals was seen as an endorsement of Biden-style centrism. Democrats have a midterm turnout problem. Being more liberal won't help. But he recently admitted that the President was \u201cunpopular\u201d in Virginia and he would have to \u201cplow through\u201d the \u201cheadwinds from Washington,\u201d though he has since sought to reframe his remark by venting broader frustration at the failure of Democratic lawmakers to pass Biden\u2019s agenda. He is particularly passionate about a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill that progressive House Democrats have refused to pass as they fight to ensure the passage of a larger social spending measure opposed by moderate Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Democratic leaders hope to pass the agenda this month ahead of the Virginia election on November 2. But if anything, the battle between left and more moderate factions is becoming even more heated in Washington \u2013 threatening that timeline and McAuliffe\u2019s campaign in the final weeks. If McAuliffe loses and the bills remain in limbo in early November, the implications for the measures themselves \u2013 and a prolonged stalemate that could damage 2022 Democratic congressional candidates \u2013 will be foreboding for the party. In the short-term, a Republican triumph in Virginia and implications that Democratic voters lack enthusiasm less than a year into their party\u2019s control of Washington would further dent Biden\u2019s political standing after a brutal summer of raging Covid-19 infections, the chaotic pullout from Afghanistan, rising inflation and lagging jobs numbers. It would also weaken the President\u2019s sway in Congress heading into a critical period with Democratic leaders facing a daunting task of funding the government and raising the debt ceiling in early December with tiny minorities. \u201cBoth parties want the bragging rights of a winner in Virginia. And if McAuliffe loses, that\u2019s going to scare some Democrats on the fence on the Biden agenda,\u201d Farnsworth said. Such an outcome would be sure to intensify the battle for the soul of the Washington Democratic Party that has put Biden\u2019s presidency on a knife-edge. Moderates may interpret a McAuliffe loss as a sign that voters are souring on the vast multi-trillion dollar Biden administration spending proposal. Progressives would double down on their view that moderate Democrats \u2013 by blocking that $3.5 trillion social spending plan \u2013 are dampening enthusiasm among liberal voters. In the end, Virginia may well correspond to its prevailing political character, and McAuliffe could inspire sufficient suburban voters to win a rare second term in office in a state where governors are barred from serving consecutive terms. But a Youngkin victory would also raise profound questions for Biden and Democrats in the longer term that will reverberate in the 2022 midterm elections and the 2024 presidential election. Youngkin walks fine line on 'election integrity' Since 2008, when Barack Obama became the first Democrat to win the state since President Lyndon Johnson, Virginia has held talismanic appeal for the party. Its demographic changes \u2013 a suburban population explosion, an influx of young, diverse more socially liberal voters, many in the tech sector, along with a reliable African American voting bloc around the state capital of Richmond \u2013 have superseded conservative, rural voters that made the commonwealth a southern bastion for decades. The state is also seen by Democrats as a template for other southern states that are becoming increasingly purple, like Georgia and North Carolina, where Democrats see demographic trends providing a long-term path to power even as some former perennial swing states like Ohio trend Republican. After finally gaining control of all the centers of power in Virginia in 2020, Democrats have passed a transformational agenda, including measures on gun control, abortion and a minimum wage increase, that a Republican in the governor\u2019s mansion could halt. So a McAuliffe loss would have strategic consequences in the state itself as well as being a terrible morale blow to Democrats running for office elsewhere. McAuliffe has driven home a relentless attack on Youngkin, blasting him in almost every media appearance and rally as a Trump clone. \u201cI\u2019m running against a Donald Trump wannabe,\u201d McAuliffe said on \u201cState of the Union,\u201d repeatedly linking his rival to an ex-President who alienated suburban Virginians who dislike culture war politics. Since many work in the government across the Potomac River, Trump\u2019s frequent abuses of power held particular resonance. \u201cI really hate to see what Glenn Youngkin is trying to do to Virginia what Donald Trump did our country,\u201d McAuliffe said. A Youngkin victory might suggest that running a searingly anti-Trump campaign against Republican candidates when the ex-President is not up for election himself may not be as effective as some Democratic strategists hope. Still, Democrats can console themselves with the fact that Trump can be relied upon to be involved in the midterms. He is doing everything he can to make himself the GOP kingmaker as he fires up what is beginning to look like an inevitable 2024 presidential run. After he alienated many women and suburban voters in 2018, when Democrats flipped the House, and in 2020, when Democrats won the White House and flipped the Senate, his ubiquitous presence \u2013 including the extremism and lies about the 2020 election that were on display at a massive rally in Iowa on Saturday night \u2013 could have a similarly damaging impact on Republican fortunes in 2022. That may be especially true if his attempt to stack GOP slates with loyalists prevents more moderate Republicans from running where they may have more appeal than hardline Trumpists in head-to-head races against Democrats. Plus, the more Trump\u2019s involved, the more he may help gin up Democratic turnout. Virginia Republicans seize on parental rights and schools fight in final weeks of campaign But by winning Virginia, Youngkin could also offer an example to other Republicans in battleground states of how to deal with the hangover from Trump\u2019s presidency while keeping the base on board. He has offered coded messages to Trump voters by talking about election integrity, for example, and was endorsed by the former President. But Trump hasn\u2019t shown up in Virginia to campaign for Youngkin, despite McAuliffe goading him to do so. The Republican has also shaped a message on economics that might appeal to both affluent Northern Virginians and those struggling against rising prices in an economy emerging from the pandemic. He proposes eliminating the state\u2019s grocery tax, suspending a recent rise in the gas tax and a list of cuts in state taxes and new rebates. He also beat more overtly pro-Trump candidates in the GOP primary. Still, his formula might not work so well in battleground states that lack Virginia\u2019s vast suburbs and other demographic characteristics and where Trump\u2019s demagogic appeal and lies about election fraud in 2020 have more currency for base voters. Youngkin\u2019s race will be keenly watched by national Republican strategists who believe issues like how transgender kids participate in school sports and a furor fanned by right-wing media commentators over critical race theory could help weaken the Democratic dominance in the suburbs. He was quick, for instance, to seize on a comment by McAuliffe in their second debate when the former governor said, \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d The issue is a lightning rod for conservative media and played into controversies on race in education that motivates Republican voters at a time when schools have also been consumed by debate over Covid-19 mask mandates. McAuliffe\u2019s attack may resonate with sympathetic suburban voters, but it was a line that actually helped Youngkin demonstrate to base voters that he was firmly on their side \u2013 voters he needs to turn out to win. So while Biden and McAuliffe have the most to lose on November 2, Youngkin\u2019s campaign is also a test case for how the GOP can improve its competitiveness as it eyes big gains in the midterms and hopes for a return to the White House two years later.",

            "article_content": "Supreme Court justices have revealed a new level of defensiveness and anger in recent weeks, showing irritation with public expectations, the news media and one another. The extraordinary public display extends beyond any single justice or case, although the majority\u2019s decision to let a Texas near-ban on abortions take effect has plainly triggered much of the consternation. On Thursday, Samuel Alito became the fifth of the nine justices to speak out, denouncing critics he said were seeking to portray the court as \u201csneaky\u201d and \u201csinister\u201d in an attempt \u201cto intimidate\u201d the justices. Alito told a Notre Dame Law School audience that the court has been wrongly cast as \u201ca dangerous cabal \u2026 deciding important issues in a novel, secretive, improper way, in the middle of the night.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito says Supreme Court is not a 'dangerous cabal' He and other justices newly speaking out have condemned the news media for playing up the significance of the court\u2019s September 1 decision that allowed an abortion ban after about six weeks of pregnancy to take effect. But as dissenting justices wrote, the decision undermined the court\u2019s precedent on abortion rights dating back nearly a half century. And the impact on the ability to obtain abortions in Texas is undeniable. Rarely have so many justices uttered such provocative, off-the-bench comments at the same time. Some are at cross purposes, but they all highlight the potential for declining confidence in America\u2019s highest court. Public opinion polls and new congressional scrutiny reinforce a possible new threat to the court\u2019s reputation and legitimacy. Conservatives have tried to minimize the significance of their rulings and suggested they are merely responding to cases that come their way. But as the right-wing majority \u2013 now with three Donald Trump appointees \u2013 has moved aggressively, liberals have not kept their despondency quiet. \u201cThere is going to be a lot of disappointment in the law, a huge amount,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in a speech Wednesday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor: 'There is going to be a lot of disappointment in the law, a huge amount' The gulf between the justices is not unlike the differences between red and blue America. A disconnect also exists between the conservative majority and the public. Gallup reported that the court\u2019s job approval rating had dropped 9 points since July, to 40% of Americans approving of the job the justices are doing. That poll was conducted in early September after the order declining to block the Texas abortion law and after it also had rejected Biden administration initiatives on US asylum policy and an eviction moratorium during the pandemic. Other recent polls have shown that fewer than one-third of Americans want Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide, overturned. The court\u2019s image and institutional acceptance may matter even more in the weeks ahead, as the justices undertake a new session that includes continued abortion-rights disputes, a test of Second Amendment rights and gun regulation, and a controversy over public aid for religious schools. The speeches of Supreme Court justices tend to be rooted in history and broad legal themes and they often seek to be inspirational. They usually shun talk of cases or current events. Most avoid politics. Justice Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s address at the University of Louisville\u2019s McConnell Center in early September stood out, and not only because it was the newest justice\u2019s first major appearance since her confirmation last year. Justice Amy Coney Barrett says Supreme Court is 'not a bunch of partisan hacks' She was introduced by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who had a strong hand in shaping the current Supreme Court. The Kentucky Republican blocked then-President Barack Obama\u2019s 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland, saying the presidential election year precluded Senate action on a Supreme Court nominee. Four years later, after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s death, McConnell ensured that Barrett was confirmed just days before the 2020 election. \u201cMy goal today is to convince you that the court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks,\u201d Barrett told the audience. \u201cThe media, along with hot takes on Twitter, report the results of decisions,\u201d she said, according to local media reports at a speech where no audio or video recordings were allowed. \u201cIt leaves the reader to judge whether the court was right or wrong based on whether she liked the results of the decision.\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas, also a conservative, struck a similar theme against the news media when he spoke to a Notre Dame Law School audience last month. \u201cI think the media makes it sound as though you are just always going right to your personal preferences,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIf they think you\u2019re anti-abortion or something personally, they think that\u2019s the way you\u2019ll always come out.\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer, who has been promoting a new book in a round of interviews, has focused on how long it took the court to build public confidence over the decades. Justice Clarence Thomas says judges are 'asking for trouble' when they wade into politics The senior liberal has urged audiences not to take such confidence for granted. He also had urged people not to see the justices as \u201cjunior-varsity politicians.\u201d Breyer, too, has criticized journalists and politicians for identifying justices by the presidents who appointed them and their political parties. The Bill Clinton appointee also argues that the current 6-3 split at the high court does not reflect politics or ideology but rather jurisprudential methods. On today\u2019s court, however, all six conservatives were appointed by Republican presidents and the three remaining liberals were appointed by Democratic presidents. In earlier eras, alignments did not break as neatly along political lines. Decisions in closely watched cases often follow the familiar lines. In the 2020-21 term, the six conservative justices (over liberal dissent) narrowed the reach of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and ruled against union organizers on agricultural land. The recent disputes regarding abortion, the eviction moratorium and asylum policy also split the justices largely by ideological and political affiliation. Of all the recent remarks by justices, Alito\u2019s were the most pointed and surprising. It is unusual for a justice to engage in such an extended public defense of internal procedures. His remarks at the Notre Dame Law School addressed the justices\u2019 process for emergency requests on what has been dubbed \u201cthe shadow docket.\u201d That phrase has mainly been used by critics, but liberal justices have also invoked it, and in the Texas abortion case, Justice Elena Kagan said the majority\u2019s action was \u201cemblematic of too much of this court\u2019s shadow-docket decisionmaking \u2013 which every day becomes more unreasoned, inconsistent and impossible to defend.\u201d Such cases are resolved without full briefings or oral arguments, often without any public explanations or recorded votes. They sometimes come late at night, such as the Texas order, which was issued at midnight September 1. Breyer speaks out on Supreme Court's Texas abortion law decision Alito tried to make the case that critics had wrongly cast the justices\u2019 handling of emergency requests as sinister and threatening. He said they act in \u201cthe dead of night\u201d because filings come to them late. He said the justices are not \u201cso deluded\u201d that they think they can \u201csneak\u201d through orders without detection. Alito also scoffed at attention members of Congress were putting on the so-called shadow docket and the Texas case. Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, holding a hearing on Wednesday, said he was skeptical of justices\u2019 assertions that politics do not influence their actions. Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, observed that during the Trump years the high court routinely favored the Republican administration in such emergency orders. \u201cSo,\u201d said Durbin, \u201cwhen Justice Breyer decides to write a book and Justice Barrett decides to go to the McConnell Center in Louisville, Kentucky, and argue that \u2018no politics, we\u2019re just playing them straight, calling them as we see them,\u2019 and then you look at this (Texas abortion case), well, it defies description.\u201d Speaking to his audience a day later, Alito attributed \u201cpolitical talk\u201d and criticism to \u201cunprecedented efforts to intimidate the court or damage it as an independent institution.\u201d",

We hop from crisis to chaos and back again in the news business, focusing each day on the things that matter most that day. But particularly in the midst of this life-altering pandemic and after the democracy-altering Trump era \u2013 which might not be over \u2013 it\u2019s worth looking back at what felt like it really mattered in the past, and what it means today. Monica Lewinsky details mental health struggles she endured during Clinton affair scandal Listen to David Axelrod\u2019s Axe Files podcast interview with Monica Lewinsky, who after decades being known as the intern who had the affair with the President has solidly taken control of her story. She\u2019s involved in the new FX miniseries about it, but Lewinsky has also emerged as an activist against bullying and cyberbullying. It\u2019s not inconceivable that younger generations will know her just as much if not more for her activism than for the sensational coverage of her affair with Bill Clinton decades ago. It\u2019s hard to believe that a male politician like Clinton could survive his affair and his lying about it in this #MeToo era. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo was forced out by allegations of harassment, after all. And he had begun his tenure with the support of activists organized under the Time\u2019s Up banner, although that support did not age well. Have things changed? Axelrod asked Lewinsky if she thought Clinton\u2019s behavior would be accepted today. \u201cI would hope not,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not as sure that we\u2019re quite as far form that if it were a handsome young Democratic president who was quote unquote good to women.\u201d The Clinton example is unlike that of former President Donald Trump, who was accused of harassment but won anyway in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. Bill Clinton was an avowed defender of women\u2019s rights and man in a supreme position of power compromised by his treatment of a young woman. Lewinsky was caught in the middle. \u201cI was not supported by the left. I was not supported by the right. It was a very painful and terrifying place to be,\u201d she said. After listening to the Lewinsky episode of Axelrod\u2019s podcast, I noticed another blast from the sensational past in CNN\u2019s excellent Total Recall podcast, in which Dana Bash revisits the rise of Arnold Schwarzenegger as California\u2019s governor. This is evidence that scandals fade over time. I recall his governorship and the recall election that put him there. I recall his time in office as a moderate Republican, a model for the party before it embraced Trumpism. I had actually forgotten that in he final days of that 2003 recall election, Schwarzenegger too faced allegations of groping and sexual harassment. He denied most of the allegations, apologized \u201cif I offended anyone,\u201d and won anyway. There\u2019s been a raft of speeches and books from Supreme Court justices recently and they do not paint a picture of a court in harmony. \u201cThere is going to be a lot of disappointment in the law, a huge amount,\u201d liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said Wednesday at an event hosted by the American Bar Association. \u201cLook at me, look at my dissents.\u201d Here\u2019s the full story on her remarks. Coming days before a new court term in which Roe v. Wade could be overturned, Sotomayor said people need to change laws they don\u2019t like and react to court decisions they disagree with. \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t change Texas\u2019 law,\u201d Sotomayor said, referring to the abortion law the Court allowed to go into effect despite her blistering dissent. \u201cBut you can and everyone else who may or may not like it can go out there and be lobbying forces in changing laws that you don\u2019t like.\u201d Counterargument: \u2018The court is not a cabal.\u2019 Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, who favored letting the Texas law take effect before its dubious constitutionality is reviewed, told an audience at Notre Dame Thursday that there is no secret agenda in the court\u2019s new and likely long-lasting conservative majority. He said his goal was to \u201cdispel some imaginary shadows\u201d and reject the idea it is acting in a way that is \u201csneaky or dangerous.\u201d He complained that criticism of the court is put forward to incorrectly imply \u201cthat a dangerous cabal is deciding important issues in a novel, secretive, improper way, in the middle of the night, hidden from public view.\u201d Read more. Another argument: The court is not \u2018a bunch of partisan hacks.\u2019 Alito\u2019s defense of the Court is in line with the newest justice, Amy Coney Barrett, who tried to convince an audience in Louisville this month that the court is driven by judicial philosophy. (Court defenders always say this, and I\u2019m sure justices don\u2019t seem themselves as partisan. The problem is that on both sides they generally, with notable exceptions, vote in extremely predictable ways that reinforce the objectives of the political party that nominated them). Agreement from the left. Justice Stephen Breyer, a liberal justice, said he and his colleagues aren\u2019t \u201cjunior varsity politicians.\u201d He said the court will adjust to the times, it just takes time. \u201c\u201dIf you go back into history, you know the court has had many ups and downs,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria as part of a book tour. He has rejected the call by some Democrats that he resign in time for Biden to nominate a younger liberal before Republicans win back the Senate, and he opposes efforts to expand the court and dilute the power of the conservative majority. \u201cIf you go back into history, you know the court has had many ups and downs,\u201d Breyer said. Agreement from the right. Justice Clarence Thomas said something similar in September when he argued for the importance of institutions in society. \u201cI think the media makes it sound as though you are just always going right to your personal preference,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cSo if they think you are anti-abortion,\u201d they think \u201cthat is the way you will always come out.\u201d \u201cThat is a problem,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cYou are going to jeopardize any faith in the legal institutions.\u201d Final counterargument. Now that there\u2019s a very strong conservative majority of justices likely to control the court for decades even as the country inches to the left, particularly on social issues, that means the court\u2019s \u201cjudicial philosophy\u201d could become increasingly out of whack with what most people want. The proof of partisan hackery is in the political effect of the decisions. It doesn\u2019t really matter if they\u2019re partisan hacks. The simple fact is that Roe v. Wade has a very strong chance of being overturned. Voting laws have a very strong chance of being further gutted. And so on. Lawmakers checked one essential box off their difficult to-do list Thursday: They passed a bill to fund the government. But it\u2019s a temporary reprieve and will keep the government open only until December 3. The coming months will also see them tackle the thornier issues of raising the debt limit, figuring out if there\u2019s enough support to pass infrastructure bills \u2013 there\u2019s both a bipartisan version and a more sweeping Democratic add-on. Democrats want to pass the longer-term funding bill in conjunction with their effort to raise the debt limit, but Republicans, who can block most legislation in the Senate, have formed a blockade against it. One-party control is not enough to govern. It used to be rare for a government controlled by one party \u2013 in this case Democrats \u2013 to be struggling to avert shutdown. But it happened under President Donald Trump. Now President Biden is going to have to figure it out how to avoid the same fate. Read more in CNN\u2019s report.",

            "article_content": "Reassured by the results of California\u2019s gubernatorial recall election last week, Democrats now face tougher electoral tests this fall that will measure whether they can defend their most important political advance of the Donald Trump era. Big gains in well-educated inner suburbs ringing the nation\u2019s major cities keyed all the Democratic victories throughout the Trump years, from their recapture of the House of Representatives in 2018 to President Joe Biden\u2019s win in 2020. Now Democrats face the challenge of preserving those advances without Trump directly on the ballot. Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s decisive victory in the California recall election offered a positive sign, with partial results showing him matching or even exceeding his 2018 performance in the biggest suburban counties \u2013 and significantly improving over his already strong 2018 showing with college-educated White voters, according to exit polls. But preserving the party\u2019s Trump-era gains with suburban voters may be tougher in the upcoming Virginia race to replace outgoing Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. Polls consistently show Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin, a wealthy political newcomer, staying surprisingly close to Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former Virginia governor, in a state that has trended steadily blue over the past decade. McAuliffe\u2019s best hope of repelling Youngkin\u2019s challenge is to maintain the advantage Democrats have established in the state\u2019s booming suburbs, particularly those in Northern Virginia near Washington and others around Richmond. McAuliffe and Youngkin spar over Covid vaccine requirements in first Virginia debate Whether McAuliffe can protect that ground will likely not only determine the Virginia governor\u2019s contest but also offer a key gauge of attitudes across the broader suburban battlefield looming in the 2022 midterms. \u201cIf you took the results of what happened in Virginia in 2017 and spread it across the country, that was 2018,\u201d says Democratic consultant Bradley Komar, who served as Northam\u2019s campaign manager in 2017. \u201cSo all eyes will be on Virginia to see if we are holding our gains in the suburbs. Are we motivating our voters without Trump in the White House?\u201d The 2016 presidential race produced a widening geographic divide, with Hillary Clinton and down-ballot Democrats improving in big urban centers and their inner suburbs and Republicans from Trump on down solidifying their control of small-town, exurban and rural communities. The 2017 Virginia governor\u2019s race provided the first confirmation that this divergence would continue \u2013 and even intensify \u2013 with Trump in office. In that race, Republican nominee Ed Gillespie generated big margins and passionate turnout from the state\u2019s preponderantly White and culturally conservative smaller communities. But he was overwhelmed by a decisive move toward Northam in the state\u2019s affluent, well-educated and racially diversifying suburban communities (along with solid African American turnout in cities such as Richmond and Norfolk). Northam notably improved in the historically Republican-leaning suburbs of Richmond. But the big shift came in the growing Northern Virginia suburbs. Northam won the big five suburban counties outside Washington by a stunning 263,000 votes. That was about double the margin McAuliffe had squeezed from those same counties while winning the governorship in 2013 and a bigger net advantage than Barack Obama managed even with a presidential-year turnout in 2012. That suburban tsunami was enough to propel Northam to a commanding 9-percentage-point win overall in a state that previously had been considered a battleground between the parties. The 2017 Virginia model, largely mirrored that year in Democrat Phil Murphy\u2019s win in the New Jersey governor\u2019s race, set the mold for elections in the Trump years. In 2018, Democrats recaptured the majority in the House of Representatives by routing Republicans in more affluent and better-educated districts, literally from coast to coast. Before the election, as I\u2019ve written, Democrats held 57% of the 182 seats with more college graduates than the national average; after the election, they held almost three-fourths of those seats. The suburban wave largely rolled on through 2020. Big, sometimes enormous, gains in affluent, diverse inner suburbs were key to Biden\u2019s victory in almost every closely contested state. Compared with Clinton in 2016, he swelled the margins by 100,000 votes in the four suburban counties outside Philadelphia, by 175,000 votes in Denver and its suburbs, and by 200,000 votes in Atlanta and its giant suburban neighbors. Biden comfortably carried Virginia by winning the big five suburban communities outside Washington by more than 500,000 votes, about 115,000 more than Clinton and more than double Obama\u2019s advantage there just eight years earlier. On the other side of this divide, Republicans through the Trump years benefited from expanding margins and explosive turnout among rural and small-town voters. Even in the 2018 Democratic sweep, that allowed Republicans to oust Democratic senators in North Dakota, Missouri and Indiana, three states with large White rural populations. Likewise, Trump\u2019s rural strength allowed him to hold states such as North Carolina and even Texas despite big Biden gains in their metropolitan centers. Democrats in 2020 also faced the limits of their suburban gains, losing some of the 2018 seats they had won in more conservative suburban areas (like Charleston, South Carolina, and Orange County, California) and failing almost completely to capture any of the further House seats they targeted in more traditionally Republican suburbs around Dallas, Houston, St. Louis and Indianapolis. This upscale vs. downscale, college educated vs. non-college educated divide really correlates to vaccination too. Don\u2019t think about it as just a Democrat vs. Republican fault line, think about it as a fault line between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. When you draw the line there, you bring a lot of independents with you and even a few Republicans. Sean Clegg, a senior strategist for California Gov. Gavin Newsom Even with these caveats, the parties emerged from the Trump presidency confronting a widening trench between rising Democratic strength inside the nation\u2019s major metro areas and consolidating Republican dominance beyond them. A key question for political professionals is whether those exaggerated patterns persist beyond Trump or, on both sides of the trench, revert somewhat toward the mean with him no longer at center stage. Last week\u2019s results in the California gubernatorial recall pointed mostly toward persistence. In partial vote counts as of this weekend, more than three-fourths of voters opposed the recall in San Francisco and its big surrounding counties of Marin, Alameda and Santa Clara (the home of Silicon Valley); in each case those results matched or even exceeded the margins for Newsom in his 2018 win and Biden in 2020. In Southern California, as of the latest count, Newsom dominated the affluent Westside of Los Angeles, won a solid three-fifths of the vote in San Diego County and even narrowly carried Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties, suburban behemoths that Republicans once usually won. (Even if the final counts tilt any of those counties narrowly toward the yes position, Newsom at worst neutralized what was once a GOP strength.) Why Democrats should be worried about Virginia's governor's race The \u201cno\u201d vote amassed big margins in the more sparsely populated inland counties that have become the California GOP\u2019s last redoubt, but until the final ballots are counted (a process that will take weeks), it won\u2019t be entirely clear whether those places kept pace with the robust turnout in the blue-leaning population centers. While cautioning that the final numbers could point toward a different conclusion, Sean Clegg, a senior strategist for Newsom, says, \u201cI think we got asymmetric turnout.\u201d Newsom\u2019s was the first Democratic campaign that faced the puzzle of motivating the party\u2019s base voters without Trump in the White House. After polls earlier this summer showed Democratic voters largely disengaged, the campaign mobilized them with three central messages. Newsom stressed the commitment of his Republican opponents to repeal the mask and coronavirus vaccine mandates he has imposed to fight the Delta variant; highlighted that his GOP rivals would seek to roll back access to abortion, as Republicans have done in Texas and other states; and linked his rivals to Trump, whom he portrayed as a continuing threat to American democracy. Newsom above all leaned into the difference on Covid-19 mandates, and exit polls conducted by Edison Research for CNN and other media organizations showed it was a winning contrast for him. In the survey, about two-thirds of voters said his approach to the pandemic had been about right or not strict enough, and he won about 85% of them. The issue was especially cutting with the college-educated voters key to the Democrats\u2019 suburban gains under Trump. In the California exit poll, according to details provided by the CNN polling unit, about four-fifths of both White and non-White college-educated voters said they supported Newsom\u2019s mandate for masks in schools and more than 7 in 10 in both groups described his approach to the pandemic as about right or even insufficiently strict. About two-thirds of non-Whites with at least four-year college degrees and an astounding 70% of college-plus Whites opposed the recall, the exit poll found; in the 2018 race, Newsom had won 59% of those college-plus White voters. There\u2019s just a lot more energy when the guy you hate is in the White House than when he is out. I think California is the anomaly, because California is so Democratic. Glen Bolger, Republican pollster \u201cThis upscale vs. downscale, college educated vs. non-college educated divide really correlates to vaccination too,\u201d says Clegg, noting that vaccination rates are much higher for Americans with college degrees than those without them. \u201cDon\u2019t think about it as just a Democrat vs. Republican fault line, think about it as a fault line between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. When you draw the line there, you bring a lot of independents with you and even a few Republicans.\u201d Newsom\u2019s private polls, as well as late public surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California and the University of California at Berkeley\u2019s Institute of Governmental Studies, all showed about two-thirds or more of vaccinated voters opposing the recall. 5 takeaways after Gov. Gavin Newsom prevails in California recall Because Virginia remains more competitive than solidly blue California, many political analysts believe that the results in its big suburbs may provide a more revealing gauge of sentiment in the subdivisions for 2022. (November\u2019s New Jersey governor\u2019s race is not drawing as much attention, because the state is considered more reliably Democratic, but also because it\u2019s unclear whether GOP nominee Jack Ciattarelli can mount a serious challenge against Murphy.) Youngkin, the Virginia GOP nominee, has two big advantages over Gillespie in 2017. One is that voters from the party out of the White House typically are more inspired to vote in off-year elections. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot more energy when the guy you hate is in the White House than when he is out,\u201d says Glen Bolger, a veteran Republican pollster. \u201cI think California is the anomaly, because California is so Democratic.\u201d Youngkin\u2019s other big edge is that even though Biden won Virginia by 10 percentage points, recent Monmouth University and Washington Post/Schar School polls have shown more voters disapproving than approving of his job performance, as he\u2019s shed support among independents amid his late-summer slump. Yet even with Biden sinking underwater, both of those surveys still showed McAuliffe narrowly leading Youngkin. McAuliffe is betting mostly on the same three messages that lifted Newsom in California. He\u2019s relentlessly linked the Republican to Trump, who endorsed him. McAuliffe has also called for codifying the right to abortion in the Virginia Constitution, an issue that has gained relevance since five GOP-appointed Supreme Court justices recently refused to block a Texas law banning abortion after about six weeks. Above all, McAuliffe has hammered Youngkin for opposing mask and vaccine mandates to fight the Covid-19 outbreak. \u201cGlenn Youngkin is against requiring masks, even though doctors and scientists have made it clear that it\u2019s key to keeping our kids safe and our schools open,\u201d a young mother declares in a new ad McAuliffe unveiled this weekend. McAuliffe has pledged to maintain the mask mandate Northam has required for K-12 students and the governor\u2019s vaccine mandate for state employees. And while McAuliffe hasn\u2019t gone as far as Newsom in proposing a statewide vaccination mandate on public school teachers and staff or health care workers, he\u2019s urged employers to set such rules and left open the possibility of imposing them himself as governor if conditions warrant next year. (He also praised Biden\u2019s proposed federal vaccination mandates on employers of 100 or more.) As last week\u2019s first debate between the candidates showed, Youngkin has resolutely opposed all state and federal mask and vaccine mandates, and while he\u2019s generally sought to downplay his opposition to abortion, he was caught on tape telling supporters he would go \u201con offense\u201d around the issue if he wins and the GOP retakes control of the state legislature. The Washington Post/Schar School poll underscored the challenge that positioning creates for Youngkin in the state\u2019s burgeoning suburbs: College-educated White voters preferred McAuliffe over Youngkin on handling both the virus and abortion by margins exceeding 15 percentage points. On the bottom-line question, the poll showed McAuliffe leading among those well-educated White voters by 12 points, a significantly bigger margin than Northam amassed among them in 2016. There is a real Republican base in Virginia, and Youngkin needs to turn the Trump voters out \u2013 but without offending the suburbs. He\u2019s in a much tougher spot than McAuliffe when it comes to picking the right issue. Bradley Komar, Democratic consultant To Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, those results capture the squeeze facing Youngkin. To maintain the super-heated energy that Trump generated among the GOP\u2019s mostly rural Virginia base, \u201che can\u2019t change\u201d his opposition to vaccine mandates or legal abortion, even though those views limit his suburban potential. \u201cYoungkin\u2019s affable and he\u2019s a good guy. But he can\u2019t do anything about the positions that are hurting him [in the suburbs],\u201d says Sabato. Bolger, the GOP pollster, says Youngkin doesn\u2019t need to run as competitively in the Virginia suburbs as Republicans did a decade ago because the party now generates so many more votes in rural areas. \u201cWe have to do better than we did in 2018 and 2020, but I don\u2019t think we have to do quite as well as we did\u201d in the first elections of this century, through around 2012, Bolger says. But Komar, the Democratic strategist, says Youngkin faces the conundrum that the hardline Trump-style positions necessary to maintain an elevated rural advantage inherently limit his potential suburban inroads. \u201cThere is a real Republican base in Virginia, and Youngkin needs to turn the Trump voters out \u2013 but without offending the suburbs,\u201d Komar says. \u201cHe\u2019s in a much tougher spot than McAuliffe when it comes to picking the right issue.\u201d Youngkin\u2019s best hope, Sabato says, may be to peel away the outer DC suburbs of Loudon and Prince William counties from the more steadfastly liberal and Democratic suburbs of Fairfax, Arlington and Alexandria closer to the city itself. (The Washington Post/Schar survey showed signs of that happening.) To secure an upset, Youngkin probably also needs a further decline in Biden\u2019s approval rating; conversely, any recovery for the President before Election Day will narrow the Republican\u2019s path. Last week\u2019s Washington Post/Schar poll was reminiscent of a late July Berkeley poll in California that stunned Democrats by showing an unexpectedly close recall race because their voters were mostly disengaged. McAuliffe is betting he can wake them up the same way Newsom did, primarily by portraying his Republican opponent as a threat to progress against the Covid-19 outbreak. Sabato thinks that will be a strong card to play. \u201cOn the vaccine side, it was the anti- vaxxers who had the energy; now it\u2019s the vaccinated population furious at the unvaccinated,\u201d he says. The balance of opinion on mandates won\u2019t fall the same way in every state; a Des Moines Register poll released Monday found a narrow majority in Iowa opposing Biden\u2019s proposed employer mandate (with huge rural opposition outweighing majority urban and suburban support). But the latest CNN survey conducted by SSRS found narrow, but consistent, national majorities supporting most vaccine mandates and even bigger numbers backing mask rules; support for the various requirements consistently exceeded 60% among college-educated White voters and 70% among Americans who have obtained the vaccine. (More than 90% of college-educated White adults have taken the vaccine, various polls show.) People voted for Biden because they didn\u2019t want Donald Trump in their living room for four more years, but they didn\u2019t vote for all this woke stuff and all these taxes and things. Everybody who wins, they overread their mandate \u2026 and I think voters are going to pump the brakes. Tom Davis, a former US representative and former chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee \u201cFor college-educated people, vaccine mandates don\u2019t seem too onerous,\u201d says Tom Davis, a former chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee who represented a district from Northern Virginia in the US House. Davis, now a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight, says that however these debates play out, the underlying dynamics of first-term midterm elections still point toward GOP gains in 2022, particularly with Biden\u2019s approval rating sagging. \u201cPeople voted for Biden because they didn\u2019t want Donald Trump in their living room for four more years, but they didn\u2019t vote for all this woke stuff and all these taxes and things,\u201d he says. \u201cEverybody who wins, they overread their mandate \u2026 and I think voters are going to pump the brakes.\u201d But if there\u2019s any path for Democrats to avoid, or even minimize, those traditional losses next year it runs through the suburban communities that shifted toward them in the Trump years. Newsom\u2019s advisers believe they found a formula to do so with his trinity of Trump, abortion rights, and vaccine and mask mandates. With McAuliffe largely replicating that playbook, Virginia looms as the next big test of whether they\u2019re right.",

            "article_content": "One year after the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, schools and hospitals have been christened for her, scholarly awards created in her name and artworks designed with her visage. Ginsburg\u2019s pioneering women\u2019s rights legacy endures, along with the signature lace-collar motif on T-shirts and trinkets. But there\u2019s another vestige of Ginsburg\u2019s legacy that has captured national attention over the past year, the one left by her September 18, 2020, death that allowed President Donald Trump to name a third conservative justice \u2013 the one that now threatens Roe v. Wade and that lingers as 83-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer deflects questions regarding when he will retire.   Liberals today are reconciling the mixed legacies of Ginsburg, who died at age 87 after rejecting earlier calls from her own admirers to step down. As the court flexes the muscle of its new conservative supermajority, many liberals bemoan Ginsburg\u2019s refusal to retire while Democratic President Barack Obama was in office and could have named her successor. Some law professor critics, writing in The New York Times, Washington Post and elsewhere, have made that refusal the starting point for their disapproval of Breyer\u2019s delayed retirement. Other liberals, however, offer a nuanced assessment of Ginsburg\u2019s past and America\u2019s present. \u201cThere\u2019s no way she would have wanted the court to be in the place that it is today. But we can\u2019t go back and change that fact,\u201d says Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women\u2019s Law Center. \u201cI don\u2019t think it undermines the dramatic work she did, for decades and decades, to protect women. \u2026 Do I wish that she was replaced by someone else? Absolutely. But I don\u2019t think she\u2019s the only one to blame here for that.\u201d Ruth Bader Ginsburg's most notable Supreme Court decisions and dissents Ginsburg\u2019s memory, one year after her death from complications of cancer, holds multiple dimensions \u2013 as did her life. She first achieved national prominence as an in-the-trenches women\u2019s rights advocate. She argued six cases before the Supreme Court, winning five of them and helping to guarantee greater equality under the law based on sex. The Brooklyn-born Ginsburg became a justice in 1993 and, after a reputation as a moderate jurist on a lower US appellate court, began amassing a distinctively liberal record. By the time she died, Ginsburg was known largely for her dissents, as well as the opera-loving, weight-lifting persona she cultivated. In 2013, a law student had dubbed her the \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d after Ginsburg penned a caustic dissenting opinion in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, as the majority rolled back protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The meme went viral, and the reserved jurist became something of a rock star, especially to young women. A year before her death, as she was fulfilling a speaking commitment in Buffalo even after discovering a recurrence of pancreatic cancer, she told the audience: \u201cIt was beyond my wildest imagination that I would one day become the \u2018Notorious RBG.\u2019\u201d Earlier, when liberals were urging her to retire, particularly when President Obama had the benefit of a Democratic-majority Senate, Ginsburg asked rhetorically in one 2014 interview, \u201cSo tell me who the President could have nominated this spring that you would rather see on the court than me?\u201d But two years later the fundamentals of Supreme Court nominations changed and for Ginsburg the stakes shot up. When Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016 and Obama nominated then-Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked all action on the nomination. The following November, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton for the presidency. That meant Ginsburg, who wanted a Democratic president to name her successor, had to hang on until the end of 2020. She nearly made it. Her last months were spent in and out of the hospital, undergoing rounds of chemotherapy and other treatment. On October 26, just days before the November 2020 presidential election, won by Joe Biden, Trump was able to gain swift GOP-controlled Senate confirmation for Amy Coney Barrett, a former US appellate judge and Notre Dame law professor. Ginsburg saw that coming in her last days. She gave her granddaughter a message to make public: \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d Thousands of people traveled to the Supreme Court to pay their respects as Ginsburg\u2019s casket was positioned at the top of the Supreme Court steps. She then became the first woman to lie in state at the US Capitol. Even at the time, it was evident that she was leaving behind a significant record of achievement and providing the catalyst for a transformed court. Trump had offered Barrett the Supreme Court slot on September 21, three days after Ginsburg\u2019s death. America\u2019s highest court, for decades resting on a 5-4 conservative-liberal axis, with swing-vote justices often providing moderation, suddenly became controlled by a 6-3 conservative supermajority. That has already caused a retrenchment on individual rights and liberal-era precedent. Most recently, the court allowed a Texas ban on abortions at six weeks of pregnancy to take effect. The prohibition conflicts with the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade, which said states could not interfere with a woman\u2019s choice to end a pregnancy before viability, that is, when the fetus could live outside the womb, at about 22-24 weeks. Now, some law professors on the left have urged Breyer to consider the consequences of Ginsburg\u2019s decision against retirement. (Like Ginsburg, Breyer was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.) The Supreme Court's actions on abortion and voting rights would have stunned RBG Writing in the Washington Post, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California-Berkeley law school, said in May, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t want to risk having his seat go to someone with an opposing judicial philosophy \u2013 which just happened to the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2013 and if he wants to give President Biden the best opportunity to choose a successor who shares his values, Breyer should step down as soon as possible.\u201d Breyer, currently promoting a book and brushing off questions about any retirement plans, may believe he can avoid the plight of Ginsburg if he retires by the end of the 2021-22 session next summer. That would be several months before the November Senate elections, when Democrats face the most obvious chance of losing their current one-vote majority in the chamber. Breyer, appointed in 1994 and entering his 28th term next month, lacks the celebrity status of Ginsburg. Katie Gibson, a Colorado State University professor of communication studies who has analyzed Ginsburg\u2019s writings, says some of that \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d attention may have distracted from her call for action in the law, particularly to preserve abortion rights. 20 years of closed-door conversations with Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u201cI really wonder about the cost of lifting her up as a heroic icon,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cHer legacy certainly deserves celebration, but people placed so much weight on her shoulders, looked at her as a savior, that they might not have been prepared for this moment now that she is gone. \u201cShe was telling us that we have a problem, that we need to be moving in our states, doing the necessary work to protect abortion rights,\u201d Gibson added. \u201cHer plea for collective action was somewhat lost in the cultural frenzy that celebrated Justice Ginsburg as a heroic individual, and I think we are seeing the consequences of that now.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Virginia gubernatorial candidates Terry McAuliffe and Glenn Youngkin sparred on Thursday over what each would do in the fight against the coronavirus, revealing a significant divide between the Democrat\u2019s backing of vaccine mandates and the Republican\u2019s argument that vaccination is a personal choice. The fight over measures to combat Covid-19 was the focus of the first gubernatorial debate from the outset of the contest, with both candidates attempting to go on offense on the issue during the event hosted by Appalachian School of Law in Grundy, Virginia. Youngkin argued that while he personally supports the Covid vaccine and wants everyone to get the shot, he believes \u201cthat individuals should be allowed to make that decision on their own.\u201d He also pushed for McAuliffe to join him in taping a public service announcement to \u201cencourage all the Virginians to get the vaccine.\u201d Pressed on whether he, as governor, would join his Republican colleagues and challenge President Joe Biden\u2019s recent vaccine mandates, Youngkin did not give a direct \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer, but said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that President Biden has the authority to dictate to everyone that we have \u2026 to get the vaccine.\u201d Biden announced earlier this month a series of new vaccine rules on federal workers, large employers and health care staff. McAuliffe, a former governor of Virginia, fired back, calling Youngkin anti-vaccine and saying that he, as governor, would back up employers who mandate vaccines and would call for such mandates for people working in health care and in most education settings and for those pursuing higher education. The Democrat also said, after being pressed by moderator Susan Page, that he would support adding the Covid vaccine to those required for students older than 12, since the US Food and Drug Administration has authorized use of the vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds. \u201cI am for requiring, mandate vaccinations. He\u2019s not,\u201d said McAuliffe, who is running for a second stint in office in a commonwealth that bars governors from serving successive terms. \u201cHe wants to do PSAs. PSAs aren\u2019t going to get you anything. I want everybody to be vaccinated here in the commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d Youngkin responded to the barb by saying, \u201cMy position on the vaccine has been very clear. I absolutely encourage all Virginians to get the vaccine.\u201d McAuliffe jumped back in: \u201cHe is not requiring vaccinations. That is the difference between the two of us. Asking to do a PSA is a political stunt. \u2026 Who cares about PSAs? Half the people wouldn\u2019t know who you are on TV.\u201d McAuliffe\u2019s campaign is also putting money behind this message, running a statewide TV ad this week featuring a doctor calling out Youngkin for opposing certain vaccine and masking mandates. A recent CNN poll found that Americans have grown more supportive of coronavirus vaccine mandates for workers, students and in everyday public life, with specific support for requiring vaccinations for office workers returning to the workplace (54%), students attending in-person classes (55%) and patrons attending sporting events or concerts (55%). The fight to stop the spread of the coronavirus has become one of the most salient political issues for Democrats right now, with many Republicans pushing back against any vaccination mandates. The Democratic strategy to focus on the coronavirus and mandating the vaccine has been buttressed by the recent failed recall of California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who defeated the attempted ouster by running primarily on the strict coronavirus measures he put in place while the state\u2019s top executive and attacking his primary Republican opponent, Larry Elder, for saying he would roll back those coronavirus actions. A primary lesson Democrats have taken away from Newsom\u2019s easy win is that pledging to aggressively fight the coronavirus pandemic, including by mandating vaccines in certain settings, is good politics, especially with the Democratic base and independent voters who are concerned about the spreading Delta variant. That is why McAuliffe returned to the issue throughout the debate, at one point attacking Youngkin\u2019s pledge to do certain things on his first day in office by blithely saying, \u201cHis day one plan would be to unleash Covid.\u201d The issue, though, was not the only one to split the candidates during the debate, with each taking on the topics of abortion rights, Virginia\u2019s economy and election integrity. Both candidates pledged that they would accept the results of the gubernatorial election, even if the other won. And Youngkin said he doesn\u2019t \u201cbelieve there\u2019s been significant fraud in Virginia elections\u201d and that he did not agree with former President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on the Virginia voting system. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to have a clean, fair election and I fully expect to win,\u201d Youngkin said. Even still, McAuliffe looked to tie Youngkin to Trump throughout the night, calling the gubernatorial candidate a \u201cTrump wannabe\u201d who has been endorsed by the former President and is \u201cfollowing all Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d On abortion, Youngkin said he would \u201cnot sign the Texas bill\u201d that bans most abortions after as early as six weeks into pregnancy, calling the law \u201cunworkable and confusing\u201d and noting it doesn\u2019t contain the exceptions he supports. The Texas law does not include exceptions for rape or incest, although there is an exemption for \u201cmedical emergencies.\u201d But after being pressed by the moderator on whether he would support a similar law that barred abortions just after a fetal heartbeat is detected \u2013 which is often before a woman knows that she is pregnant \u2013 and included the exceptions he supports, Youngkin said, \u201cI do believe that a pain threshold bill would be appropriate.\u201d McAuliffe, meanwhile, said he would support \u201censhrining Roe v. Wade in the Virginia Constitution\u201d and pledged to stand up to abortion laws like the one in Texas. Youngkin criticized McAuliffe\u2019s record and positions on crime and policing, claiming the Democrat would end so-called qualified immunity, civil lawsuit protections currently afforded to police officers. Progressive activists have argued that qualified immunity has been abused and shields police officers from punishment for misconduct, particularly in cases of police brutality toward minorities. \u201cWe\u2019re going to protect qualified immunity, and my opponent is going to get rid of it,\u201d Youngkin said. Asked by a moderator if he would end qualified immunity, McAuliffe said, \u201cNo, I would not end it.\u201d Youngkin accused McAuliffe of flipping his position from the one he had held during the Democratic primary. In an April statement from McAuliffe\u2019s campaign, spokesman Jake Rubenstein said the candidate supported ending \u201cpolicies like qualified immunity that can prevent accountability when heinous acts are committed against Virginians.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died a year ago this week, had been well aware that the conservatives on the Supreme Court were poised to take a right turn in areas concerning reproductive health and voting rights. But the liberal icon would likely be stunned to see how far and how fast the court has actually moved. Over the last year, the Supreme Court has not only allowed a Texas law that bars abortion after as early as six weeks into pregnancy take effect, but it announced it will hear a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade during the upcoming term in a case out of Mississippi. In addition, last July, the court scaled back voting protections in a dispute that followed the most litigious presidential election in history. \u201cJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg knew that laws about voting rights and reproductive choice are not abstract legal ideals,\u201d Jessica A. Levinson of Loyola Law School told CNN. \u201cBut she might have been astonished by the breadth and depth of the court\u2019s decisions to eviscerate protections for access to the polls and a woman\u2019s ability to obtain an abortion.\u201d The two issues represent a part of Ginsburg\u2019s legacy built over her near 30-year tenure on the high court. She was a prolific supporter of access to abortion and contraceptive coverage, and she condemned efforts to weaken the Voting Rights Act. Indeed, in 2013 after the Court gutted a key provision of the historic law, Ginsburg issued an opinion that reverberated throughout a new generation of progressive activists who came to refer to her as the \u201cNotorious RBG.\u201d The majority\u2019s move to scale back the law, Ginsburg famously wrote, was like \u201cthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\u201d Because Ginsburg died just weeks before Election Day, then-President Donald Trump was able to replace her with a conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 a move with critical implications. After Barrett took the bench, the court considered the Mississippi case for months behind closed doors before finally announcing it would hear arguments next term and decide a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy. The justices, in agreeing to take up the case and consider the law that bars most abortions in the state after 15 weeks of pregnancy, will hear the most important abortion dispute in some 30 years. Barrett also provided the critical vote early this month when the court allowed the Texas law that bars abortion before most women even know they are pregnant to go into effect pending appeal. And last term, she was in the majority when the court broke along traditional ideological lines and upheld two controversial Arizona provisions that restricted how ballots could be cast. Supporters of abortion rights fear that Barrett\u2019s votes will undermine Ginsburg\u2019s legacy when it comes to abortion. During her confirmation hearing in 1993, Ginsburg declared: \u201cThere is something central to a woman\u2019s life, to her dignity.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a decision that she must make for herself,\u201d she continued, \u201cand when government controls that decision for her, she\u2019s being treated as less than a fully adult human responsible for her own choices.\u201d On the bench, she repeatedly ruled in favor of reproductive rights. In 2007 when the court upheld a federal law that barred so-called \u201cpartial birth abortion,\u201d Ginsburg dissented. She took issue with the majority\u2019s contention that \u201cwomen who have abortions come to regret their choices, and consequently suffer from \u2018[s]evere depression and loss of esteem.\u2019\u201d   \u201cThis way of thinking reflects ancient notions about women\u2019s place in the family and under the Constitution \u2013 ideas that have long since been discredited,\u201d Ginsburg said. In 2014, the majority ruled in favor of a closely held corporation that brought a religious objection to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that health care plans include contraceptive coverage. Ginsburg dissented, calling the majority\u2019s decision one of \u201cstartling breadth.\u201d In a concurring opinion in a 2016 case in which the court blocked abortion restrictions in Texas, Ginsburg wrote to emphasize what would happen to poor women if the restriction had been allowed to go into effect. \u201cWhen a State severely limits access to safe and legal procedures, women in desperate circumstances may resort to unlicensed rogue practitioners,\u201d Ginsburg said, adding, \u201cat great risk to their health and safety.\u201d In 2020, she dominated during oral arguments in a case concerning a Louisiana law that required doctors to have admitting privileges in a nearby hospital. \u201cMost of the people who get abortions never have any need to go to the hospital, isn\u2019t that so?\u201d she queried, continuing to dismantle each argument in favor of the law, point by point. In another case in 2020, when the court was hearing oral arguments by telephone because of Covid 19, Ginsburg called in from her hospital bed as she was fighting off infection. The case concerned the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to weaken the Affordable Care Act\u2019s so-called contraceptive mandate. \u201cYou have just tossed entirely to the wind what Congress thought was essential \u2013 that is that women be provided these services with no hassles, no cost to them,\u201d she told a government lawyer. \u201cJustice Ginsburg said time and again that we will never have true gender equality in the absence of women having reproductive freedom,\u201d said Amanda Tyler, a former Ginsburg law clerk who was writing a book with the justice at the time of her death. \u201cThe two are inextricably intertwined,\u201d Tyler said. Flash forward to September 1, just shy of the one-year anniversary of Ginsburg\u2019s death. In a late night order, the court formally allowed the controversial Texas law to go in effect. Overnight, Roe became a dead letter in the second largest state. Critics of the law said it was carefully crafted to make it difficult to challenge in court. That\u2019s because it specifically precluded Texas officials from enforcing it. Instead, any individual, from anywhere in the country, could bring a lawsuit against a person who helped someone access the procedure in violation of the law. The majority \u2013 including Barrett \u2013 said that while the court wasn\u2019t weighing in on the constitutionality of the law, it would allow it to go into effect pending appeal. \u201cIt is unclear whether the named defendants in this lawsuit can or will seek to enforce the Texas law against the applicants in a manner that might permit our intervention,\u201d the majority wrote. John Roberts has lost control of the Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, in dissent, wrote that the law was \u201cunprecedented.\u201d He said that he would have blocked the law to give courts the chance to consider procedural questions. \u201cThe desired consequence,\u201d Roberts wrote, \u201cappears to be to insulate the State from responsibility for implementing and enforcing the regulatory regime.\u201d Writing for her liberal colleagues, Justice Sonia Sotomayor went much further, lashing out at the majority for its \u201cstunning\u201d order. \u201cPresented with an application to enjoin a flagrantly unconstitutional law engineered to prohibit women from exercising their constitutional rights and evade judicial scrutiny, a majority of Justices have opted to bury their heads in the sand,\u201d she said. Ginsburg would not only have disputed the case on the merits, but those who know her said she would have called out the procedural tactics. \u201cGinsburg was a consistent voice for procedural integrity at the Court,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cShe would have been up in arms over the court allowing such a restrictive law to go into effect in direct contravention of longstanding precedent and while the court has a pending merits case before it implicating the same core issues.\u201d \u201cWe are now seeing just how profoundly unfortunate her absence from the Court is, given that her vote could have stayed the Texas law from going into effect,\u201d Tyler concluded. In the voting rights area, the court has also moved right since Ginsburg\u2019s death. In 2013, Roberts wrote a 5-4 majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, effectively gutting Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain the permission of the federal government or the courts before enacting new laws related to voting. Shelby County ruling could make it easier for states to get away with extreme racial gerrymandering Ginsburg dissented, invoking the umbrella metaphor and calling the Voting Rights Act \u201cone of the most consequential, efficacious, and amply justified exercises of federal legislative power in our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d Last term, with Ginsburg no longer on the bench, the court heard a case concerning two provisions of Arizona voting law that critics said violated a separate provision of the Voting Rights Act. Justice Samuel Alito wrote the 6-3 majority opinion upholding the laws and stressing that the state had an \u201centirely legitimate interest\u201d in the prevention of fraud. Justice Elena Kagan responded fiercely in dissent, noting that the justices had \u201cno right\u201d to remake the law. \u201cWhat is tragic here is that the Court has (yet again) rewritten\u2014in order to weaken\u2014a statute that stands as a monument to American\u2019s greatness, and protects against its basest impulses,\u201d Kagan wrote. In her dissent, Kagan cited Ginsburg eight times.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are trying to distance themselves from Saturday\u2019s right-wing rally on Capitol Hill, an event that could present a tough optics problem for the party as Democrats plan to tie all Republicans to the most extreme elements of the GOP. No sitting member of Congress is scheduled to appear at the \u201cJustice for J6\u201d event in Washington, DC, which is being organized by a former Donald Trump campaign staffer in support of the rioters who were arrested for storming the US Capitol on January 6. But even without a presence on the ground, several Republican lawmakers have offered public support for insurrectionists who have been jailed. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election have become a litmus test in the GOP, with 78% of Republicans in a new CNN poll saying Biden did not win the 2020 election, while efforts to downplay the deadly events of January 6 have become pervasive on the right. And several Republican congressional candidates either participated in the January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d protest that incited the riot or will speak at the upcoming demonstration. The revisionist history that is coursing through the GOP \u2013 and which will take center stage at Saturday\u2019s rally \u2013 is threatening to become a political liability for the GOP, although Republican operatives believe the economy and inflation will be the most salient issues in the midterms. At the very least, events like the one this weekend are opening old wounds for the GOP and putting Republican leaders in an uncomfortable position: they are eager to turn the page on an ugly chapter in their party\u2019s history, but are being forced to grapple with a fired-up base that is increasingly sympathetic to the rioters. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, is already framing the next year\u2019s elections in these terms: \u201cDemocrats want to move infrastructure, and Republicans want to be insurrectionists.\u201d Temporary fencing to surround Capitol ahead of September 18 right-wing rally House Republicans only need to pick up five seats to win back the majority, and historical trends and redistricting maps both favor the GOP. Democrats, facing an uphill climb in their quest to retain power, are now coalescing around a midterm strategy that highlights the GOP\u2019s extremism on everything from election lies and conspiracy theories to vaccine misinformation and strict abortion laws. Specifically, Democrats are signaling that they plan to paint vulnerable Republican lawmakers as Trump-loyal radicals \u2013 especially after the failed effort to remove California\u2019s Democratic governor on Tuesday, which Maloney argued was a rejection of the Trump brand and the GOP message. \u201cThat ought to send a chill down the spine of Kevin McCarthy, who thinks he can do this toxic Trump stuff without the Trump turnout that papered over how bad that message is for voters in swing districts,\u201d Maloney said. Republicans, however, strongly pushed back on the notion that any broad electoral trends could be extrapolated from the recall effort in the Golden State, where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2 to 1. \u201cThe recall election won\u2019t have any impact on the midterms and anyone who claims otherwise doesn\u2019t have a clue what they are talking about,\u201d Torunn Sinclair, a spokeswoman for the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm, said in a statement. As Democrats sharpen their message, law enforcement officials are bracing for potential violence and unrest on Saturday. The event comes the same week that the US Capitol Police arrested a man near the Democratic National Committee headquarters who was spouting White supremacist views and had in his truck knives that are illegal in DC \u2013 a reminder of the increasing threat posed by far-right extremists and domestic terrorism. Yet even as the right-wing rally has sparked renewed fears of political violence, GOP leaders have not publicly condemned the upcoming event and its cause or actively encouraged people to skip it, though McCarthy did tell reporters he doesn\u2019t think any Republican members will attend and top Republicans, including Trump, haven\u2019t promoted the event. McCarthy has also remained silent after freshman Rep. Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina suggested \u201crigged\u201d elections could \u201clead to one place, and that\u2019s bloodshed\u201d and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama offered measured sympathy for a suspect who claimed to have a bomb in his truck near the Capitol last month and was critical of Democratic lawmakers. Democrats are amplifying their warnings that the GOP\u2019s continued embrace of Trump\u2019s election lies and other extremist rhetoric could lead to a January 6 repeat. And Democrats are also slamming some on the far right for turning rioter Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed as she tried to storm the Capitol, into a martyr. An internal intelligence memo reviewed by CNN warned that there have been heated discussions online about Babbitt in connection to the Saturday rally, which Rep. Eric Swalwell has characterized as a Republican celebration of \u201ccop killers.\u201d Even some in the GOP wish their own party would do a better job of calling out lies about the 2020 election. \u201cFrankly, I think we need more honesty,\u201d freshman Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump for inciting an insurrection, said during a recent Washington Post Live event. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what can be done when individuals feel like they\u2019re being winked and nodded to.\u201d \u201cThese are literally life or death implications,\u201d he added, \u201cand leaders need to be clear of where they stand and need to be clear what they believe.\u201d Saturday\u2019s rally is expected to be smaller in scale than the one on January 6, but law enforcement officials are preparing for the possibility that the crowd could turn violent or be armed. As a precautionary measure, the temporary fencing around the Capitol is being reinstalled, while the Capitol Police have requested assistance from the National Guard should they need it that day. Matt Braynard, the organizer of the event, has insisted it will be peaceful and has encouraged attendees not to wear any Trump or election-related gear. Some of the most haunting images and videos from January 6 are of the pro-Trump mob beating police officers with American flag poles. Saturday\u2019s speaker lineup includes Joe Kent, who is running to unseat Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington state, another of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, and Mike Collins, who is vying to replace Rep. Jody Hice, a Georgia Republican who is running for secretary of state in the Peach State after pushing to overturn last year\u2019s presidential election results in Congress. The public appearance by the pair of congressional candidates, who are both face GOP primaries, suggests that supporting the jailed rioters is something they believe could give them a boost with their conservative base. Even if no sitting member of Congress attends, several House Republicans \u2013 including Reps. Louie Gohmert of Texas, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Matt Gaetz of Florida and Paul Gosar of Arizona \u2013 have aligned themselves with a similar cause, referring to the jailed insurrectionists as \u201cpolitical prisoners.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll be able to make [the rally], but we know that there were people that were arrested for January 6 activities, and they have been so badly mistreated,\u201d Gohmert told CNN before the recess break. \u201cSo we haven\u2019t given up.\u201d Ahead of the rally, the top four congressional leaders received a security briefing from US Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that law enforcement seems better prepared this time around. \u201cThe Leadership of the Congress, on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, has been briefed by the Capitol Police Board on the nature of the threat and the unprecedented preparations to address another attempt to defile our national purpose,\u201d Pelosi said Wednesday in a \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter. In describing the rally, Pelosi added: \u201cThere is a wish by some to continue the assault on the U.S. Capitol with misinformation and malice. \u2026 Working together, we will honor our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution, as we engage in reconciliation and pass legislation For The People.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated who would participate in local rallies.

            "article_content": "Pope Francis on Wednesday said bishops debating whether to deny communion to public figures who support abortion rights, such as President Joe Biden, should make their decisions from a \u201cpastoral\u201d viewpoint and not a political one. \u201cThe problem is not theological, it\u2019s pastoral,\u201d Francis told reporters while traveling from Slovakia to Rome on Wednesday. \u201cHow we bishops deal with this principle. We must be pastors, also with those who are excommunicated. Like God with passion and tenderness. The Bible says so.\u201d His comments come amid a simmering debate within the US Catholic Church over granting communion to Catholic politicians who support abortion rights, including the nation\u2019s second Catholic President. Biden had been denied the sacrament in the run-up to the election and the issue drew new attention in June when the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops proceeded with a plan that could deny communion to such public figures, setting up a potential public rebuke of the President. By a vote of 168 to 55, with six abstentions, the bishops had gone forward with plans for a report on the meaning of the Eucharist in the church. The vote is part of a longer process, and the Vatican would have to approve any action on behalf of the bishops. Catholics for Choice, a liberal Catholic group that advocates for abortion rights, said at the time that it was \u201cprofoundly saddened\u201d by the vote and condemned using the Eucharist \u201cas a weapon of punishment.\u201d \u201cIn a country and church already riven with tension and division, today the bishops chose to be partisan instead of pastoral, cruel rather than Christ-like,\u201d the group said. \u201cThey have chosen to disobey Jesus\u2019s command to \u2018feed one another,\u2019 but everyday U.S. Catholics \u2013 67 percent of whom oppose withholding Communion and other Sacraments from supporters of abortion rights \u2013 will continue to know better and do better.\u201d An abortion rights advocate and the first Catholic US president in nearly 60 years, Biden displays a devotion to regular religious services not seen from recent presidents, who were professed Christians but intermittently attended church or worshipped privately while in office. He married his late first wife, Neilia, in a Catholic church, attends weekly Mass, and peppers his political speech with quotes from Scripture, Catholic hymns and references to the nuns and priests he learned from in school. Pew surveys show more than half of US Catholics favor abortion rights and most American Catholics do not believe Biden should be refused communion. \u201cThe pastor knows what to do. In every moment that he leaves the church\u2019s pastoral path he immediately becomes a politician,\u201d Francis said Wednesday. ",

            "article_content": "The attempted recall of California Gov. Gavin Newsom will reach its crescendo on Tuesday, with polls and ballot return data so far showing the Democratic governor in a strong position to stay in power in the nation\u2019s largest Democratic state. The recall effort is a largely a mail-in ballot election. All active voters in the state receiving have been sent a ballot in the mail ahead of Election Day, but people who would like to vote in person have been able to do so, as well. In-person polls close at 8 p.m. PT on Tuesday in California. California recall election: Live results and news A string of recent surveys have shown Newsom and the anti-recall effort with a strong lead. The most recent survey from the Public Policy Institute of California found that 58% of likely voters favor keeping Newsom in office, compared to 39% who would like to remove him. But if a majority of Californians vote to remove Newsom, the second question on the ballot will determine who replaces him. Republican talk radio host Larry Elder is running away with the contest, according to the same polls.   Newsom has closed the attempted recall by nationalizing the contest, focusing on what it would mean for California \u2013 one of the most liberal states in the country \u2013 to be represented by a Republican, comparing Elder to former President Donald Trump and slamming the way other Republican governors have led their states during the coronavirus pandemic. Elder has repeatedly hit Newsom for more local issues \u2013 ranging from homelessness to drought to crime \u2013 but has ended his campaign by baselessly suggesting \u201cshenanigans\u201d in the contest, claims that have been echoed, without evidence, by Trump and right-wing media. Newsom\u2019s ouster would be a massive blow for Democrats, but if he is able to win on Tuesday, the recall failure could ding Republican plans to run against Democratic overreach in combating the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 especially in a series of competitive California House races in 2022. Here are six things to watch for on Election Night in California: Newsom was blunt when asked on Sunday whether the margin of his potential victory on Tuesday mattered. \u201cA win is a win,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe are just trying to get our people out.\u201d But national Democratic officials and operatives across the country will be watching the results with an eye on lessons to take away for the 2022 midterms and beyond. Recalls are unique elections \u2013 they are far more about the incumbent, less about the national environment and this election is happening at an uncommon time for people to vote \u2013 but if the \u201cno\u201d on recall vote only wins by single digits in deep blue California, several top Democrats will worry about what that portends for the party in 2022. Newsom\u2019s team was well aware of this headed into the recall. Early polls showed Republicans were far more animated to vote in the recall, even if they were outnumbered nearly 2-to-1 in the state. That gave Newsom\u2019s top operatives a bit of agita, with their nightmare scenario being a fired up Republican base and a depressed \u2013 or unaware \u2013 Democratic base. Based on ballot return data \u2013 Democrats appear to be overperforming their party registration in ballots that have already been returned \u2013 that worst-case-scenario has not been realized. Before the results are even announced, leading Republican candidate Elder has seized on former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud and baselessly raised the prospect of \u201cshenanigans\u201d in California. Casting doubt on the integrity of elections \u2013 despite the reality that there is no evidence of widespread fraud anywhere in the United States \u2013 has become popular in GOP politics and is almost demanded by a base still loyal to Trump. And Elder \u2013 who had previously said President Joe Biden won in 2020 \u201cfairly and squarely\u201d \u2013 has more recently embraced those same lies. \u201cThe 2020 election, in my opinion, was full of shenanigans,\u201d Elder said recently on Fox News. \u201cAnd my fear is they\u2019re going to try that in this election right here and recall.\u201d Elder is being egged on by Trump, who said in a statement filled with falsehoods on Monday, the day before the election: \u201cDoes anybody really believe the California Recall Election isn\u2019t rigged?\u201d Elder said his campaign has a team of lawyers that will \u201cfile lawsuits in a timely fashion\u201d if problems arise. Newsom may have been looking to keep his job as the top executive of California. But his message in the closing days of the campaign has been notably national. Newsom repeatedly warned Democratic audiences that Elder was \u201cto the right of Donald Trump,\u201d invoking the former President who remains deeply unpopular in California. The governor also compared his leadership to that of Republican governors in Florida and Texas, accusing the two taking their states off a \u201cCovid cliff.\u201d And the Democratic leader called on numerous national Democrats \u2013 from President Joe Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris to former President Barack Obama to Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar \u2013 to come to his aid in the final weeks of the campaign. Elder, too, has taken a national tone on his campaign by noting that he, in the possibility of a US Senate vacancy, could appoint a Republican and end Democratic control of the legislative body. This strategy has turned Tuesday\u2019s election into a pseudo-referendum on whether Trump \u2013 and the ongoing specter of Trumpism \u2013 can still turn Democratic voters out a little less than a year removed from the 2020 election. Based on conversations with numerous Democratic voters in California, it is clear Trump remains front of mind. \u201cWhen you have another candidate who\u2019s very similar to what we had 4 years ago, that\u2019s not what we want in California,\u201d said Maria Morales, an elected official in El Monte, California. \u201cWe want to be as progressive as we had in the past.\u201d Republicans had hoped a recall election in deep-blue California would reveal a national playbook on how to run against Democratic overreach in combating the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, if polls are accurate, it could have the opposite effect \u2013 revealing broad public support for measures like the vaccine mandates Newsom has imposed on teachers and health care workers. Newsom has not only run toward strict coronavirus measures, he has made them central to his closing argument to voters and used Elder\u2019s pledge to roll back the rules against the Republican gubernatorial hopeful. Other Democrats on the ballot this year, including New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Terry McAuliffe in Virginia, have also embraced vaccine mandates. Though all three are running in blue states, their approach showcases the increasing belief among some Democrats that the tide of public sentiment is turning against Republicans who are advocating for the personal rights and choices of those whose refusal to get vaccinated is helping prolong the pandemic. If Newsom wins by a healthy margin, it could strengthen Democrats\u2019 belief that tough measures intended to stop the spread of Covid-19 will pay off this year and in next year\u2019s midterm election. It could be a long night. If the recall is close, California is not known for speedily counting ballots, meaning the eventual outcome of the contest could take some time to determine. Every active voter in California has been mailed a ballot for this recall and, for those ballots to be counted, they must be returned either in person by the close of polls on Tuesday, or they must be postmarked by Election Day and received by county officials by September 21, seven days later. California was one of only a few states to change their election rules for the 2020 election and require that all voters receive a ballot in the mail before Election Day. That practice continued for the recall and Democrats in the state\u2019s legislature have advanced a bill that would ensure all active registered voters receive a ballot for all elections going forward. Newsom did not say whether he would sign the bill during a conversation with reporters on Saturday, but did say, \u201cThe prospect of California extending it is afforded the governor of California and I hope to be there to consider the signing that.\u201d Rarely has a candidate garnered as much attention, while registering as little interest from voters, as reality television star and former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner. Jenner began the recall campaign with one major asset: In a massive field of little-known candidates, she had widespread name recognition. After all, California had seen political novices leverage their celebrity status before: In 2003, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger emerged as the Republican winner after the state recalled unpopular Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. Jenner, though, at times faced hostile and transphobic treatment \u2013 including at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Dallas. She stumbled in interviews, both early and late in the race, including saying on CNN last week that she supported abortion rights but also supported Texas\u2019 decision to outlaw abortion beyond six weeks \u2013 before many women even know they are pregnant. And she left the state, and the country, in July, in the middle of her campaign, to film a reality television show in Australia. Jenner now enters Election Day barely registering in the polls.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. There is something strange and circular in our ongoing fight over what freedoms Americans should enjoy. We are precisely 20 years out from the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, after which Americans gave up a lot of individual liberties in the name of safety. Air travel, especially, was changed forever and the government began moving toward a much more expansive use of surveillance. Now we\u2019re in a place where people are completely fine taking off their shoes and belts in public before they can board domestic flights because of a foiled long-ago plot, but have resisted wearing masks \u2013 let alone offering up their Covid vaccine status \u2013 in-flight amid a deadly global pandemic. And Republicans are accusing President Joe Biden of authoritarianism, rejecting his effort to compel companies to make employees submit to either vaccinations or regular testing. The effort, which has been announced but not yet detailed, will come through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which means it\u2019s a matter of workplace safety. RELATED: Biden\u2019s six-step Covid plan, explained Republican governors have promised to sue the Biden administration to stop the effort. It\u2019s a flip of the script from the Trump years. We\u2019re still reeling from four years in which Americans saw a President consider using the military in his own country and actively and openly tried to stop the democratic process, which would have robbed every American of some kind of freedom. There is ample evidence then-President Donald Trump was reading from an authoritarian playbook in his effort to upend the election. The Republican congresswoman, Elise Stefanik of New York, who tried to help Trump object to the election he lost, argued Biden\u2019s public safety efforts were \u201cunconstitutional, unlawful, and an authoritarian power grab that has become a hallmark of his failed Presidency.\u201d RELATED: Biden to GOP critics looking to challenge new vaccine requirements in court: \u2018Have at it\u2019 The feds have accusations too. Further complicating questions of freedom is Biden\u2019s accusation that states rejecting local mask and vaccination rules are incorrectly imposing their will and endangering people in the process. Vigilante abortion lawsuits in Texas are a twist on rights. Separately, his Department of Justice is suing Texas over its restrictive new law that all but outlaws abortions in the state by giving private citizens a sort of vigilante license to sue anyone who facilitates an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. Wartime measures. Biden\u2019s vaccine requirement effort is extraordinary in terms of government intervention, compelling companies to touch many millions of workers. But this is a war against Covid-19, which has killed so many hundreds of thousands of Americans. Questions of rights. When a government can require people to stay home, when it can require them to wear a mask indoors, have become so political even though they are central to the effort against Covid-19, which has no politics. The details are still coming, but it will be challenged in court. RELATED: This is what a US endgame for Covid-19 should look like, Fauci says A vaccine is different than putting a person in prison. There\u2019s a difference between Biden\u2019s decision to use the government to get people stuck with an FDA-approved vaccine and other extraordinary suspensions of rights. President Franklin D. Roosevelt rounded up and detained Japanese Americans during World War II. President Abraham Lincoln suspended habeus corpus during the Civil War. President Andrew Jackson forced Native Americans from their homes and marched many to their deaths. All of these were ultimately rejected by courts, but not in time to reinstate rights, restore property or give back lands. The question now is whether a shot in the arm will be viewed as a national imperative or government overreach. The Supreme Court has said the public interest in combating disease outweighs an individuals opposition to a vaccine. But it did that more than 100 years ago, in 1905, regarding smallpox, a disease the World Health Organization declared eradicated in 1979. Here\u2019s a nugget bringing it all together. In 2002, when the country was still extremely concerned about terror attacks, President George W. Bush ordered 500,000 members of the military to get the smallpox vaccine in the off chance of a biological warfare terrorist attack. Today, American schoolkids get a wide range of vaccines, all approved by the FDA. A number of states \u2013 15 according to the National Conference of State Legislatures \u2013 allow opt-outs for nothing more than personal belief and skepticism. Those have led to a resurgence of  certain vaccine-preventable diseases, like measles. A new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS and released ahead of the 20th anniversary of 9/11 finds Americans still feel the affects of the attacks. Here are some interesting points from CNN\u2019s report on the poll: Twenty years from now, when Covid, hopefully, is something we\u2019ve defeated, I wonder if people will be talking about how the pandemic changed their lives and if the idea of Covid-19 vaccines will be at all controversial.",

            "article_content": "John Fetterman thinks Senate Democrats are making a big mistake. The party has a rare opportunity with a majority in Congress and control of the White House. But Fetterman, Pennsylvania\u2019s lieutenant governor who is running for Senate, fears Democrats are wasting that opportunity by not eliminating the filibuster and failing to enact key priorities. \u201cStop apologizing for the space we take up as a party and ram some stuff through and get it done,\u201d Fetterman said in an interview with CNN. \u201cAs a Democrat, I would just hate to be in a position of only being able to accomplish what Mitch McConnell allows us to.\u201d Fetterman, who stands at a towering height of 6-foot-8 inches tall and has tattoos down his arms, identifies as a populist and said during the interview that he is running as a \u201cget sh*t done Democrat.\u201d He argues the party is not delivering on promises to voters and warns the stakes are too high for inaction as bills to protect voting rights and prevent gun violence hit a wall in the Senate as a result of the filibuster, which requires 60 votes to pass most legislation. \u201cWhen you have the kind of extreme measures that are being used by the Republicans, now is the time to stand together. These are dangerous times,\u201d he said. \u201cI guarantee the Republicans, given the chance, would be far more ruthless.\u201d The fight over the filibuster has created a major dilemma for Democrats: Should the party shatter precedent and go it alone to lock down major legislation or focus instead on across-the-aisle cooperation? With key moderates opposed, there are no signs that Senate Democrats, who control only 50 seats, will eliminate the 60-vote threshold, but pressure continues to build and either choice risks a backlash. Whatever happens will be a major part of the legacy Democrats leave behind. The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip \u201cWhen you really put together a core list of the things that are wildly popular and desperately needed by our country that we could accomplish by simply putting this rule aside to get it done, it\u2019s astonishing,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d The Democratic Senate candidate has a message for anyone in his party who won\u2019t support policies like a $15 dollar minimum wage, voting legislation and safeguarding access to abortion. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re a Democrat if any one of those issues isn\u2019t something (where) you can say, \u2018Yes, we need to protect universal voting access rights. Yes, you can\u2019t live on anything less than $15 an hour. Yes, this is settled case law, Roe v. Wade,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a party for you if you don\u2019t support all of those kind of basic, fundamental populist things.\u201d Pennsylvania is a political battleground that went for Joe Biden in 2020 and Donald Trump in 2016, but Fetterman doesn\u2019t fit the mold of the kind of play-it-safe centrist candidate the Democratic party often runs in swing states. The state will have an open Senate seat in 2022 since Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for reelection. The contest has quickly become one of the most high-profile Senate races in the country and is widely viewed as Democrats\u2019 best chance to pick up a Senate seat in the upcoming midterms. Fetterman mounted an unsuccessful Senate bid in 2016, before he became lieutenant governor. This time around, as a statewide elected official who\u2019s leading the fundraising race, he has been talked about as an early front-runner in the Democratic field. He has so far raised the most of any candidate in the race, Democrat or Republican, at a total of over $6.5 million. He faces a crowded Democratic primary field and a high-profile opponent in Conor Lamb, a Democratic congressman who represents the state\u2019s 17th congressional district and became nationally known in 2018 when he flipped a House seat from red to blue in a special election. Lamb is a recent entry to the field, having announced his campaign in August, and has so far raised over $1.4 million. The race will put to the test whether a Democrat like Fetterman can win a Senate seat in a purple state like Pennsylvania in the current era of bitterly-divided partisan politics. He has long championed marijuana legalization and officiated same-sex marriages before it was legal in his home state. He has defiantly flown pro-legalization and LGBTQ pride flags outside his office at the state capitol after Republicans in the state legislature pushed to take them down. He once called Trump \u201cno different than any other random internet troll,\u201d and endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary as the Vermont independent ran on a progressive platform. Asked if he has spoken with Bernie Sanders recently, he said, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. I also endorsed and campaigned heavily for Hillary Clinton too, and I also campaigned strongly for Joe Biden too. It\u2019s always been about what\u2019s best for Pennsylvania.\u201d (Fetterman stayed neutral in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and backed Biden during the general election.) On Fetterman\u2019s left arm is a tattoo of the zip code for Braddock, the struggling steel town where he served as mayor until 2019. On his right arm are the dates of violent deaths that took place in Braddock while he was mayor. He proudly proclaims that he only owns one suit, and chose not to live in the lieutenant governor\u2019s mansion. Instead, he lives with his family in a converted car dealership in Braddock, while he and his wife, Gisele, opened up the pool at the mansion to the public. \u201cThe people of Pennsylvania don\u2019t owe me a mansion with a chef and a gardener,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud that my family and I live across the street from a steel mill and a union hall. This is where my wife and I want to raise our family, not in a mansion \u2026 and we\u2019ve opened up the swimming pool to kids across Pennsylvania.\u201d As he campaigns across the state of Pennsylvania, Fetterman has asked crowds of voters what they think of how Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema are voting, and if that\u2019s what they want in their senator. Manchin and Sinema, two influential moderate Senate Democrats, have both been outspoken in saying they oppose eliminating the filibuster. \u201cIt\u2019s like boo, no, no no,\u201d Fetterman said, describing the reaction he has gotten from voters when he asks the question. \u201cAt no point does anyone ever raise their hand and say \u2018no, I think that\u2019s the right way forward.\u2019\u201d Asked if he\u2019s picking up on voter frustration when he gets that kind of response, he said, \u201cFrustration is a generous word. It\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s anger. It\u2019s exasperation. Why are we squandering this opportunity?\u201d Manchin and Sinema have also recently indicated they do not support spending $3.5 trillion on a massive economic package that Democrats hope to soon pass in Congress without Republican support to address health care, the climate crisis and a range of other priorities. \u201cIf you, as a Democrat, are pleased with the way they are voting, or not voting, then I am not that kind of Democrat,\u201d Fetterman said, referring to Manchin and Sinema. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much a criticism as just making a statement and differentiating between myself and that.\u201d Manchin represents the deep red state of West Virginia, while Sinema represents Arizona, a longtime conservative stronghold that voted for Biden in 2020. Both have argued the filibuster helps facilitate bipartisanship and protects the country from extreme swings in policymaking as control of government moves from one party to the next. They have also argued the filibuster is a critical tool that ensures the minority party still has a seat at the table and Democrats can use it to defend and uphold their priorities when they do not control the majority. The recent negotiation and passage in the Senate of a $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package with funding for roads, bridges, rail and transit is evidence that collaboration between the two parties can yield results. But Fetterman argues that if Democrats make bipartisanship the overarching goal, they will cede important issues to Republicans, and he warns the GOP is already enacting extreme policies. \u201cLook at what they\u2019ve already done to voting rights,\u201d he said. \u201cLook at what they\u2019ve already done to abortion rights. Look at what they\u2019ve already done to just basic truth, the way they talk about the election in my state and all these other states.\u201d There is one way, though, that Fetterman thinks Democrats should emulate Republicans to get things done. \u201cRepublicans have demonstrated time and time again of being ruthless. Look at what they did with Merrick Garland. Look at how they exploited the death of Justice Ginsburg and they rammed Amy Coney Barrett through. They move with efficiency when they need to and this is a time when Democrats should emulate that and enact these things,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re clutching our own pearls over saying, \u2018Hey let\u2019s drop this antiquated rule and pass this fundamentally and immensely popular and beneficial and transformative legislation for the American people who voted us into control of the White House, the Senate and the House.\u2019\u201d A number of Democrats are competing in the Senate primary. In addition to Lamb, other candidates include state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and Val Arkoosh, who serves as chair of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners. Asked why he thinks he\u2019s the best candidate in the Democratic primary, Fetterman replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never said that I am. That\u2019s up to the people of Pennsylvania to decide.\u201d The candidates and their records are now under scrutiny as they fight to make it to the general election. While Fetterman supports a wide range of liberal policies, he opposes an immediate ban on fracking, an industry central to the local economy in parts of Pennsylvania. He argues that Democrats can\u2019t abandon workers employed by the industry and dismissively tell them to \u201cgo learn how to code,\u201d and says the party must acknowledge that powering the country with renewable energy won\u2019t happen overnight. \u201cI\u2019ve never taken a dime in money from the industry and I never will,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cTwo things are true at the same time. Republicans have to be honest and acknowledge our climate crisis. Democrats also must acknowledge the reality of our energy grid, our energy sources and the needs of energy security for our nation.\u201d \u201cWe should transition away from carbon-based fuels, but that is not something that you can just flip a switch metaphorically, no pun intended, and start immediately like banning fracking,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a transition.\u201d He has also faced questions over a 2013 incident in which he left his home armed with a shotgun after hearing what he believed to be gunshots and confronted a man who turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger. Fetterman has said the man was wearing a face mask and he was not aware he was Black, and that race played no part in his actions. He has noted the man was running toward an elementary school and the incident took place in the aftermath of the Sandy Hook school shooting. \u201cI made the decision at that point to intervene to stop him from going any further until the first responders could arrive,\u201d he says in a video released by his Senate campaign. Fetterman told CNN he didn\u2019t have anything further to add on the subject beyond what he has already said publicly when asked about the incident. If he makes it to the general election, there will be more challenges, including whether a Democrat like Fetterman can win over conservatives and Trump voters in a purple state. Trump recently endorsed Sean Parnell, an Army veteran and former congressional candidate, in the competitive Republican primary. Fetterman has a track record of success at the state level having won a statewide Democratic primary for lieutenant governor and then a statewide general election when he was on the ticket with Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf in 2018. \u201cThere are enough reachable people in our Commonwealth that just want stuff to work. They want things to run,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about saying we\u2019re going to turn these deep red counties blue. This is about acknowledging there are enough people in Pennsylvania that are open to a message of, \u2018you want infrastructure? Hey how\u2019s your internet service, how\u2019s your cell phone service? Well, It sucks. Let\u2019s change that,\u2019 \u2026 We don\u2019t have to agree on everything to agree on enough things.\u201d But Fetterman knows there are some voters that will never be reachable. \u201cIf you believe that horse dewormer is the way to go with Covid, hey, you need to know I don\u2019t. I\u2019m vaccinated. I believe in masking. If that means I don\u2019t get your vote well then I\u2019m sorry about that, but at least you know the truth.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett, Greg Krieg, Eric Bradner and Samira Said contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "When California Gov. Gavin Newsom took the lectern from Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren here at Culver City High School on Saturday, his warning to the audience took a markedly national tone. \u201cYou saw the Big Lie, you saw what happened on January 6, you have seen the voter suppression laws all across the country and you saw what just happened in Texas,\u201d he said, referring to a number of Republican-led efforts that have infuriated Democrats. \u201cWe said last year, we all said this\u2026 the most important election in your lifetime was last November, defeating Donald Trump. But know this, we did not defeat Trumpism.\u201d Then he turned to his own fight: \u201cIt is still alive all across this country and\u2026 it has come to the state of California.\u201d What to know about the California recall The Democratic governor may be fighting for his job as the top executive in the nation\u2019s largest state, but his message in the waning days of the campaign has been national, warning Californians that what Republicans are doing in states like Florida and Texas could come to the Golden State if voters decide to oust him in favor of a Republican on September 14. And he\u2019s cast his leading opponent, Republican Larry Elder, as someone who will bring Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party to the state that proudly stood against the former President during his four-year term. Taking her cues from Newsom, Warren wasted little time on stage before making the same national pitch, arguing \u201cgovernors matter\u201d because of recent controversial moves in the fight against the coronavirus by Ron DeSantis, Florida\u2019s Republican governor, and on abortion by Greg Abbott, Texas\u2019 Republican governor. \u201cIf what happened in Texas or Florida or South Dakota makes you worry about the future of our nation\u2026 then Governor Larry Elder should absolutely terrify you,\u201d she said, before dealing the biggest applause line: \u201cLarry Elder dreams of being California\u2019s own Donald Trump. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I would fight with everything I\u2019ve got to keep from putting one more Donald Trump Republican in office.\u201d For Newsom in this final phase of the race, it\u2019s a turnout game rather than a campaign about persuasion. Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1 in a state that President Joe Biden won by nearly 30 points. But polls throughout the summer showed that Republican voters were much more fired up than Democratic voters about casting their ballots in the recall. Still, in order to overcome their math problem in the Golden State, Republicans would have to post a massive turnout while Democratic turnout remained relatively low. Latino voters could be key to Gavin Newsom keeping his job Early ballot returns suggest that Newsom has made some headway in convincing Democrats that there is a real risk to their agenda if they don\u2019t participate. With more than 5 million ballots returned, Democrats were maintaining a strong advantage \u2013 overperforming their registration level in the state. But their party\u2019s voters are much more comfortable voting by mail, and Republicans could still turn out in large numbers as voting centers open this weekend and they have a chance to cast their ballots in person or on Election Day. So Newsom\u2019s team is taking no chances, which is why they have brought Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and others into the state \u2013 and why they hope President Joe Biden will still make an appearance to keep Democratic turnout strong in the closing days. Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to campaign with Newsom on Wednesday. The best way to boost turnout, according to top Democrats in the state, is to heavily lean into the national implications of the race. At nearly every event Newsom does \u2013 virtual or in person \u2013 the governor has argued that the recall is a chance for Democrats to push back against the conservative GOP agenda of the post-Trump era. The recall election, the Democratic governor said Thursday, \u201cis part of an extended narrative that started with a big lie, extended to the insurrection on January 6, extends to the voter suppression laws you\u2019re seeing all across the country \u2013 and yes, to what you saw yesterday in Texas and the assaults on women\u2019s rights and reproductive freedom in this nation.\u201d At nearly every public event since Texas\u2019 six-week abortion ban went into effect on Wednesday, Newsom has alluded to the law and sounded the alarm about his chief opponent\u2019s opposition to abortion to argue that this race has national implications. Newsom fights recall by sharpening contrast with Elder in effort to energize female voters \u201cWhat more evidence do we need than the last 48 hours as we reconcile what just happened with the US Supreme Court and what is happening in Texas,\u201d Newsom said Thursday evening in a get-out-the-vote event with Latino leaders after the Supreme Court formally denied a request from Texas abortion providers to freeze the state law. Elder maintains that his own opposition to abortion would not lead to changes \u2013 reasoning that any moves he made in that direction would be thwarted by the Democrat-controlled legislature. But Elder, too, is not shying away from the national implications of the contest. On Mark Levin\u2019s radio show Friday, Elder said the reason national Democrats are interested in the race is because of the \u201c50-50 split in the Senate in Washington, DC\u201d and the possibility of having to replace Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the state\u2019s 88-year-old senior Democratic senator. \u201cGod forbid Gov. Elder should replace Dianne Feinstein,\u201d Elder said. \u201cThey are afraid I am going to replace her with a Republican, which I most certainly would do. And that would be an earthquake in Washington, DC.\u201d During a news conference with Newsom following the rally Saturday, Warren repeatedly deflected questions about Feinstein\u2019s health and whether she believed it was a real possibility that Newsom would have to appoint someone to replace California\u2019s senior senator in the next few years. Feinstein\u2019s team has repeatedly said she has no plans to retire before her term is up. Newsom has explicitly warned that his recall would help national Republicans and hurt Biden, who needs all the votes he can get to move his agenda through Congress, where Democrats narrowly control the House and hold a tie-breaking vote in the Senate because of Harris. \u201cWho would have Larry Elder appointed to replace Kamala Harris,\u201d Newsom asked rhetorically on Thursday about his decision to nominate then Secretary of State Alex Padilla to the seat when Harris became vice president. \u201cWould Chuck Schumer be majority leader or minority leader? What would that mean to the Biden agenda? Would there be a stimulus bill that has provided relief to restaurants like this?\u201d On Friday, Newsom made his pitch to LGBTQ voters squarely about stopping the kind of politics that elevated Trump: \u201cWe defeated Trump last year. We all worked hard to defeat Trump. We said it was the most important election in our lifetime, but we haven\u2019t defeated Trumpism.\u201d The messaging is a smart use of California\u2019s political tilt for Newsom, said Matt Barreto, a professor at UCLA and a top adviser to \u201cBuilding Back Together,\u201d the outside political group aligned with Biden. \u201cCalifornia is even more Democratic in national politics than it is in state politics. It is a smart move to remind people that there are national implications. Nobody knows what the tea leaves are but there could be another Senate appointment,\u201d he said, nodding to a possible Feinstein replacement. Some 22 million ballots have been mailed to the state\u2019s registered voters, asking them to them first to answer a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d question on whether they want to recall Newsom, then to choose from a list of more than 40 candidates to replace him. Though a majority would have to vote to oust Newsom, if that first question were to succeed, it\u2019s possible his replacement could win with a simple plurality. That\u2019s one reason why Newsom and his Democratic allies have been so eager to attack Elder, who has polled the highest among the main competitors. Newsom has accused Elder of wanting to turn California\u2019s Covid response into hotspots like Florida and Texas, where cases have sparked of late. California recall contender Larry Elder makes misleading claim that young people don't need Covid-19 vaccines \u201cThis is a matter of life and death,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cIt is not hyperbole to suggest that.\u201d And presenting himself as a champion for women\u2019s reproductive rights, Newsom has especially been using Elder\u2019s positions on social issues to convince Democratic voters that they must return their ballots, even if they are frustrated by the many crises that the state is facing, including the Covid-19 pandemic, wildfires, drought, homelessness, and a dearth of affordable housing. Despite saying he\u2019d appoint a Republican to a vacant Senate seat, Elder has been evasive about how he would use his executive powers he\u2019d have as governor if he won. \u201cBefore Roe v. Wade in California, abortion was pretty much available on demand, and in the event that Roe v. Wade is overturned, abortion will still be pretty much available on demand here in California,\u201d Elder said during a Zoom press conference on Wednesday, the same day the Texas law took effect. \u201cI am pro-life and I don\u2019t believe Roe v. Wade was decided properly, and in the unlikely event that Roe v. Wade is overturned, the matter goes back to the states and to the legislatures,\u201d Elder said when asked about the Texas law. \u201cWe have two-thirds super majorities in the (California) Senate; two-thirds super majorities in the Assembly; and there is zero possibility that all of a sudden, those two-thirds are suddenly going to become pro-life.\u201d Earlier in the week when asked by CNN to respond to Democratic supposition that he might use the powers of the governor\u2019s office \u2013 including executive orders or his purview over state agencies and the state budget \u2013 to restrict access to abortion if elected, Elder deflected by challenging the premise of the question: \u201cWhat does Roe v. Wade have to do with my campaign?\u201d he said repeatedly. \u201cWhy are you bringing this stuff up?\u201d Elder has used that strategy of deflection \u2013 accusing reporters of asking about issues that he says are not part of his agenda \u2013 to rebut questions about his past statements on an array of controversial issues that could alienate progressive and moderate voters in this blue state. During an interview with CNN on Monday, when asked about his position that the minimum wage should be zero, he said he wouldn\u2019t plan to do anything about it if elected as California\u2019s governor: \u201cThat\u2019s not even close to anything on my agenda list.\u201d But Newsom and his allies on the campaign trail aren\u2019t buying into that. \u201cThis is a profoundly consequential race, not just here in California, but all across the country,\u201d Newsom said Thursday.",

            "article_content": "Vice President Kamala Harris will campaign with California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday in the Bay Area, following through on her commitment to help the embattled Democratic governor defeat the Republican-led effort to oust him in the September 14 special election. The former California senator will be the most high-profile surrogate to appear with Newsom, who was targeted by Republicans for recall early last year \u2013 an effort that gained steam because of anger among many Californians about his pandemic restrictions. Newsom is campaigning in Los Angeles on Saturday with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as they attempt to activate Democratic voters, who had been much less enthusiastic about returning their ballots than Republicans, according to polling throughout the summer. Advisers hope that the vice president will help reinforce to progressive voters the stakes of Newsom\u2019s potential ouster and replacement by a Republican, especially how California could affect the fragility of the Democratic majority in the 50-50 US Senate. As governor, Newsom appointed Harris\u2019 Democratic replacement in the Senate, and he could potentially be tasked with that role again if he had to name a replacement for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is 88, if she were to decide to retire early \u2013 though she has no plans to do so. Latino voters could be key to Gavin Newsom keeping his job Newsom\u2019s allies believe Harris can emphasize the California governor\u2019s power to advance women\u2019s rights \u2013 especially in the wake of Texas\u2019 strict six-week abortion ban going into effect, as well as the agenda of progressive voters and voters of color. Harris\u2019 visit will also represent her first opportunity to test out a pre-midterm election message, following a chaotic few weeks that halted much of the momentum the White House had built in the early summer months to pass their fall agenda. \u201cIn many ways, Biden\u2019s successes somewhat hinges on having a willing partner in California,\u201d a source familiar with planning told CNN. \u201cThis period between now and the midterms is critical for the Biden administration \u2013 for their chances of holding control of Congress, but probably also the White House. In the nation\u2019s most populous state, the White House knows it needs a strategic partner to close the unvaccinated gap, spend down hundreds of billions in the CARES Act and American Rescue Plan, among other priorities. A Republican governor would probably undermine many of those objectives,\u201d the source added. Harris had been scheduled to campaign with Newsom last month but canceled her rally after a terrorist attack in Afghanistan killed 13 US service members amid the final days of the US withdrawal from the country. The White House has said that President Joe Biden also intends to campaign for Newsom but the timing of that event has not been formally announced.

            "article_content": "Both the premise and promise of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency and a possibly brief Democratic grip on Washington are suddenly on the line, as the legacy of past electoral disappointments and harsh realities of power suddenly converge. In the seven-month span of Biden\u2019s term, this is the worst of times for Democrats. A stroke-of-midnight eclipse of Constitutional abortion rights in Texas that shocked liberals, a new threat from moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin to Biden\u2019s vast congressional agenda and the President\u2019s own stumbles in Afghanistan dragged this White House to its lowest moment yet. Friday brought its own series of bad news for the President in the form of a disappointing August jobs report \u2013 only 235,000 jobs were added to the economy last month, far off the estimates of 728,000 or more \u2013 and General Motors\u2019 announcement that it is shutting down production at most of its plants in North America for a week or two as the microchip shortage becomes a crisis. Add in the Republican Party\u2019s expanding assault on voting rights and a looming fight over raising government borrowing levels, and Democrats face a struggle to repay the faith of their 2020 voters. And that\u2019s without horrendous tests from a pandemic that is again filling hospitals, targeting unvaccinated Americans \u2013 including, increasingly, kids who have been left waiting on regulators \u2013 and looking likely to dog the White House deep into midterm election year. Each of these crises is putting Biden\u2019s leadership under extreme examination and in several cases exposing his inability to meaningfully shift prevailing dynamics because of divides in his own party and Republicans\u2019 obstructive power.   The President has issued stirring and even angry demands for action on voting rights and abortion rights. But a 50-50 Senate and a new conservative Supreme Court majority severely limit his options \u2013 unless he is prepared to embrace the political earthquakes of abolishing Senate filibuster obstruction rules and enlarging the nation\u2019s top bench, which he has neither the political majorities nor personal inclination to do, to the fury of progressives. The challenges facing Biden also highlight a more over-arching question about his governing philosophy. How can a President dedicated to restoring and using traditional Washington methods to pass a massive program do so when confronted by a Republican Party that has already shown itself ready to shred regular order to gain and regain power? The new difficulties follow a head-spinning three weeks that actually started in triumph when Biden succeeded in shepherding a bipartisan infrastructure bill and $3.5 trillion spending blueprint through the Senate. But the sequence of subsequent dramas has stretched the White House, exposed the limits of the Democrats\u2019 thin majorities and \u2013 in the case of the chaotic withdrawal from Kabul \u2013 displayed the capacity of outside events to destabilize presidencies at any moment. Biden turns to nation building at home, but the political threats he left behind in Afghanistan could come back to haunt him It\u2019s one thing for the progressive wing of the party to demand sweeping presidential action to enforce their priorities immediately. But the Democratic Party is hardly an ideological monolith. Its congressional leadership, who must be conscious of the moderate lane Biden traveled to the White House, appears to have neither the internal unity or stomach to flex power ruthlessly in the manner of rule-breaking Republicans on the filibuster and the high court. And the cumulative power of conservatism built up over years, even with Republicans currently locked out of power in Washington, is showing itself to be a formidable political force. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a master of obstruction, deploys the filibuster with aplomb and enjoys heaping pressure on moderate Democrats, every one of whose votes the President needs. And the conservative majority on the Supreme Court, by refusing to block a near-total Texas abortion ban, drove home its power to destroy liberal dreams not just now, but for years to come. Apart perhaps from the shock victory of Donald Trump on election night in 2016, the Texas abortion law \u2013 which bars abortion after as early as six weeks into the pregnancy and contains no exceptions for rape or incest \u2013 may be the most traumatic moment for liberals in many years. It was obvious the new Supreme Court conservative majority was gunning for Roe v. Wade. But the manner in which the justices acquiesced in the effective stripping of Constitutional rights of women in Texas in a 5-4 decision, which included no hearings or detailed arguments, was staggering. As was the fact that the Texas law, which allows anyone in the US to sue a person \u2013 doctor, family member or Uber driver, for example, who helps someone else get an abortion \u2013 appears to introduce a form of vigilante justice with grave implications for other constitutional rights. For decades, the threat to abortion was expected to come in a frontal assault on the 1973 Roe decision. Biden launches federal effort to respond to Texas law as he faces pressure to protect abortion Now, unless the Supreme Court reverses itself at a later date, conservative states have a formula to simply bypass the landmark legislation entirely. Biden reacted to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision with a strongly worded statement and instructed his administration to examine what options there are to guarantee a woman\u2019s right to choose in Texas. The President decried \u201can unprecedented assault on a woman\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d Vice President Kamala Harris promised the ruling was not the \u201clast word\u201d on Roe v. Wade. Attorney General Merrick Garland said the Justice Department was \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the Texas abortion law. Garland\u2019s statement was especially ironic since had McConnell not twisted convention to deny him a Supreme Court seat in President Barack Obama\u2019s last year in office, the entire outcome of the Texas abortion episode may have been reversed. But in any case, strong statements are unlikely to change the momentum of this issue, or satisfy progressives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi vowed to bring up a measure guaranteeing equal access to abortion as soon as the chamber returns from recess next week. She said the Texas law is \u201cthe most extreme, dangerous abortion ban in half a century, and its purpose is to destroy Roe v. Wade.\u201d But there are nowhere near the 60 votes needed in the Senate to pass such a major piece of legislation that almost all Republicans would oppose. To overcome that barrier, Democrats would have to vote by a simple majority to change the filibuster. But Manchin, several other Democratic senators and even Biden himself have balked at such a step, partly due to fears about how a future unfettered Republican Senate and White House could swiftly remake America \u2013 perhaps in the image of anti-abortion, pro-gun Texas. Another option backed by many progressives during last year\u2019s election campaign was a scheme to simply expand the Supreme Court to counter what Democrats see as at least two illicit Republican appointments. John Roberts has lost control of the Supreme Court Biden, a Washington institutionalist, whose entire political project relies on forging national unity through bipartisan measures like his infrastructure bill, has shown little interest in such a step that would ignite a political firestorm. Biden did form a commission to advise him on court reform. But it was widely seen as a way of side-stepping demands by the Democratic left for court packing. Ultimately, the Texas abortion law and the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal to stop it reflect the hangover from what seems to become a more disastrous election for Democrats in 2016 with every year that passes. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat paved the way for Trump to seat three new justices \u2013 Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett \u2013 and the Texas abortion law is just the start. The Democrats\u2019 underperformance in another election, the 2020 congressional contests, are behind their other big political problem this week. Only two runoff victories in Georgia allowed Democrats to take control of the Senate in a disappointing showing since Biden did far better in unseating Trump. The resulting 50-50 majority in the Senate means that every single vote is needed to pass anything by a simple majority. Biden cannot lose even one Democrat. So Manchin\u2019s new warning that he is not just uncomfortable with the size of the $3.5 trillion dollar spending package but also the concept and the idea of passing it at the current moment threatened real trouble for Biden\u2019s domestic legacy. \u201cInstead of rushing to spend trillions on new government programs and additional stimulus funding, Congress should hit a strategic pause on the budget-reconciliation legislation,\u201d Manchin wrote in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cA pause is warranted because it will provide more clarity on the trajectory of the pandemic, and it will allow us to determine whether inflation is transitory or not.\u201d Biden\u2019s legislative skills mean it\u2019s far too early to assume he will not be able to talk Manchin around. There have been other moments when the legislation\u2019s prospects have seemed dark. And most bills have near death moments before they pass. But the complex choreography needed for this particular measure leaves it especially vulnerable. And it\u2019s also fair to ask how low Senate Budget Committee Chairman Bernie Sanders and House progressives are willing to go on the size of the final package and on its timing. Not very far, if key House progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is to be believed. \u201cMaybe we hit the \u2018cancel\u2019 button on this so-called \u2018bipartisan\u2019 charade of an Exxon lobbyist drafted infrastructure bill unless we actually pass a law that helps people\u2019s lives with healthcare expansion, childcare, climate action, etc,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter. Manchin\u2019s doubts do not just endanger a single Democratic priority. The spending blueprint is a monster that pretty much includes all of Biden\u2019s top priorities in a measure that can evade the filibuster and pass with a limited device known as reconciliation. But if Democrats can\u2019t get Manchin on board it is doomed. And this is also about more than one bill. The spending bill is part of a delicate dance designed to convince progressives like Ocasio-Cortez to back the bipartisan infrastructure measure that she mentioned. That proposed law would be a landmark of the Biden presidency but falls far short of the hopes of more liberal members.",

            "article_content": "As conservative talk radio host Larry Elder has surged to the front of the Republican pack in the effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrats have redoubled their efforts to activate female voters to come to Newsom\u2019s defense \u2013 warning that California could face a very different future under Elder or another Republican whose positions are largely outside the mainstream in the state. Many female voters are exhausted and frustrated by Covid-19 restrictions, last year\u2019s school closures and the state\u2019s homelessness crisis \u2013 all key vulnerabilities for Newsom\u2019s team as they fight against Democratic apathy ahead of the September 14 election. So the controversy over Elder\u2019s positions and past derogatory remarks about women has supplied the governor\u2019s allies with welcome talking points as they urge disengaged and disenchanted Democratic women to return their ballots. Elder\u2019s past comments have drawn increasing scrutiny in recent weeks \u2013 putting the talk radio host on the defensive. After his comments about women surfaced, two of his most prominent GOP opponents on the ballot, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer and reality TV star Caitlyn Jenner, called for him to drop out of the race to replace Newsom. What you need to know about the California recall Faulconer sharply criticized Elder for his past comments about women during a debate sponsored by KCRA 3 and the San Francisco Chronicle Wednesday night \u2013 alluding to the talk radio host\u2019s past assertion that women exaggerate sexism and his books that appeared to suggest employers should be able to discriminate against women who are or intend to get pregnant, which was first reported by Media Matters. \u201cHis attack on working women is unconscionable,\u201d Faulconer said of Elder, before addressing \u201call the working moms out there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to support your right to raise a family, to have a career. Unlike what Larry Elder is talking about, I\u2019m going to make sure that California\u2019s daughters have the same opportunities as California\u2019s sons. We need a governor that\u2019s going to stand up for working women and knows that every woman in this state can have a career, can raise a family.\u201d Vote-by-mail ballots have now been sent to 22 million voters across the state who are being asked two questions: first, whether they want to recall Newsom, and second, who they would like to replace him with. There are no establishment Democratic candidates vying to replace Newsom among the 46 candidates who qualified for the ballot, and party leaders are urging Democrats to skip the second question altogether and just vote \u201cno\u201d on the recall before returning their ballots. In recent days, Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California has joined with other groups that favor abortion rights in trying to activate their members both in the Golden State and nationally against what they have framed as an \u201cextremist recall attempt.\u201d Mid-way through a year when other states across the country have enacted 90 abortion restrictions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, and the Mississippi\u2019s GOP attorney general asked the US Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, leaders with Planned Parenthood have argued that Newsom\u2019s ouster could jeopardize coverage for abortion in California\u2019s Medi-Cal program, as well as access to birth control and funding for other public health programs that serve women. Elder told the Mercury News in a recent interview that he believes Roe v. Wade should be overturned and that the decision on abortion rights should go back to the states. The newspaper reported that Elder said he doesn\u2019t understand why California voters would be worried about abortion rights, because the state has an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature that is unlikely to pass new limitations. Newsom has highlighted those issues \u2013 and how they could be at risk given the governor\u2019s purview over the state budget and the line-item veto \u2013 while also noting that a Republican governor would have broad powers to appoint judges and other key positions like the heads of agencies in California. He has also emphasized the importance of Democrats\u2019 narrow control of the 50-50 US Senate, asking female voters to imagine who a Republican like Elder would have appointed to fill Kamala Harris\u2019 Senate seat after President Joe Biden chose her to be his vice president. Many of his Democratic allies have noted that Newsom\u2019s appointment power carries huge significance for their party, because US Sen. Dianne Feinstein is 88 and less than half-way through her six year term \u2013 even though her aides say she has no plans to retire early. During a livestreamed conversation hosted by Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California last week, Newsom noted that while 50% of voters would have to vote to recall him, the replacement candidate could be decided by a simple plurality \u2013 \u201cmeaning it could be a very small subset of the electorate that will ultimately determine the fate and future\u201d of California, he said. \u201cThat could directly impact women\u2019s reproductive rights and the issues of women and girls,\u201d Newsom told activists during the conversation, noting his own advocacy for increasing access to reproductive services, expanding supplemental payments to physicians and working to \u201cdouble the health care and reproductive budgets in this state.\u201d \u201cAll of that could be impacted by someone like a Larry Elder who has been devoutly for decades opposed to (Roe v. Wade), who doesn\u2019t believe in a glass ceiling, doesn\u2019t believe that women are as smart as men,\u201d Newsom said, referring to Elder\u2019s comment in a 2000 column that \u201cwomen know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m proud of being a sanctuary state. I\u2019m proud of being a universal state\u201d when it comes to reproductive rights, Newsom added. \u201cI\u2019m proud of being a state that offers refuge to so many, particularly in the world we\u2019re living in today. And all those values and principles \u2013 this notion of a universal state \u2013 that, God forbid, if Roe is overturned, will be even more consequential.\u201d Newsom and his allies have also alluded on the campaign trail to a broad array of Elder\u2019s other past comments regarding women, which were chronicled by CNN\u2019s KFile. In 1996, Elder said \u201cwomen exaggerate the problem of sexism.\u201d He has ridiculed premenstrual syndrome, known as PMS, calling it \u201cPunish My Spouse (or Significant Other).\u201d In January 2017, he mocked the women who attended the Women\u2019s March as \u201cobese.\u201d Elder\u2019s campaign did not respond to CNN\u2019s request to discuss how the controversy over his past comments has affected female voters, and he has declined CNN\u2019s queries about most of his past remarks regarding women. In a memo to reporters on Wednesday, the campaign noted that Elder\u2019s 2000 assertion that women know less than men about political issues, economic issues and current events stemmed from his interpretation of a study at that time by the Annenberg School at the University of Pennsylvania. The study asked both men and women 25 questions about policy related to the political primaries at the time, the Elder campaign said. \u201cMen knew more than women in 15 categories. Women outperformed men on only one question,\u201d Elder\u2019s communications director Ying Ma said in the memo. \u201cThe study concluded that women knew less because they got their information from local news.\u201d It is not only Democrats who are expressing dismay with that record as they appeal to California\u2019s female voters. Faulconer, who became mayor of San Diego in part by building a bipartisan coalition in that city, cited Elder\u2019s comments about women as evidence that Elder \u201cis unfit to serve as governor of California\u201d and called on him to drop out of the race. \u201cElder\u2019s backwards positions harm women\u2019s rights and the livelihoods of California families,\u201d Faulconer, who supports abortion rights, said in a statement. \u201cElder\u2019s lack of judgment and character flaws threaten the success and credibility of this historic recall movement \u2013 Californians will not vote to recall one dysfunctional Governor if it means replacing him with another.\u201d Jenner tweeted last week that Elder should drop out of the race, quoting Elder\u2019s statement about women\u2019s awareness of political issues from his 2000 column. \u201cYou are not what CA wants let alone what we need. I am the proud father of very powerful, intelligent, successful women. You\u2019re as bad as @GavinNewsom towards women,\u201d the reality television star said. In a state where Democrats still outnumber Republicans by nearly two-to-one, Newsom has had the support of a majority of women, according to recent polling. In an August CBS News/YouGov poll, 44% of female likely voters said they would vote to recall Newsom while 56% said they would vote to keep Newsom in office. Among male likely voters, 52% said they would vote to oust the Democratic governor while 48% said they would vote to keep Newsom in office. In a May survey of California likely voters by the Public Policy Institute of California, 62% of women approved of the way Newsom was handling his job, while 34% disapproved. (Only 45% of likely male voters approved, compared with 50% who disapproved of how Newsom was doing his job.) For Newsom\u2019s allies, the contrast with Elder \u2013 particularly on women\u2019s issues and the GOP candidate\u2019s controversial stances like his opposition to the minimum wage \u2013 has become a powerful weapon in attempting to counter the apathy among Democratic voters that has emerged. That may be especially the case among women. As the Covid-19 pandemic has continued to disrupt daily life, the burdens of child care and homeschooling have often disproportionately fallen on women. Many have dropped out of the workforce \u2013 or lost jobs \u2013 as a result of the pandemic at alarming rates. Their exasperation has often been directed at their leaders, and some of them joined in the grassroots effort collecting the signature petitions that led the Newsom recall to qualify for the ballot. In a conversation with CNN\u2019s Kyung Lah, a group of Democratic women from Los Angeles who supported Newsom when he won with more than 60% of the vote in 2018, explained those frustrations with the Democratic governor as they fail to see measurable progress on some of the most difficult problems in California like the skyrocketing cost of living, wildfires, drought and homelessness, which has exploded in the state with tents blanketing the corridors of many middle class neighborhoods. When asked whether she blames Newsom, Los Angeles voter Alisa Sandoval told Lah: \u201cHe\u2019s the leader, everything starts from the top and it goes down.\u201d But she also said she would feel \u201csick\u201d if a Republican were elected as a result of Newsom being recalled. Cherryl Weaver, also a registered Democrat, said she too is leaning toward voting to recall Newsom and is \u201cdisappointed by the Democratic Party in general\u201d at a time when Republicans do not hold any statewide office. \u201cIn my mind, when he was running, there was nobody else in the world that would have been better,\u201d Weaver said, \u201cand instead it\u2019s become politics.\u201d The continuing problem of homelessness in Los Angeles \u2013 despite Newsom\u2019s significant investment in housing programs \u2013 has been both heartbreaking and scary for Democratic voters like Michelle Helseth: \u201cIt\u2019s like: let me work, let me pay my taxes, but provide me with safety\u2026and not be accosted by two homeless people within a matter of 15 minutes.\u201d California GOP Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson said the aggravations felt by many women during the pandemic \u2013 and the perception that Newsom was driven by politics as he changed Covid-19 rules and regulations \u2013 has created a real opportunity for Republicans during the recall. Many mothers paid attention, she noted, to the fact that Newsom\u2019s own children were back in the classroom during the fall of 2020, and that he attended a dinner party unmasked at an expensive Napa Valley restaurant at a time when he was telling Californians to stay home and avoid large gatherings with families outside their households. \u201cLet\u2019s be real, moms are pissed off,\u201d Millan Patterson said in an interview. \u201cParents are just so fed up with the \u2018Do as I say, but not as I do\u2019 rhetoric that we get from this governor,\u201d Millan Patterson said. \u201cEvery single day \u2013 every single decision that he makes \u2013 makes it easier for us to make the case to women that Republicans are going to do what\u2019s best for our children, and not the teachers\u2019 union.\u201d But In Elder, Democrats see their own potentially powerful contrast. Jodi Hicks, president/CEO of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, said the contrast between Newsom and Elder on policy issues has increasingly crystallized the stakes of the recall for many Democratic voters. She acknowledged that there was apathy about the race among some progressive voters, even as recently as a few weeks ago, but said she has noticed that is changing. Hicks noted, for example, that she has seen a rapid uptick among supporters of Planned Parenthood who are volunteering to phone bank and text on Newsom\u2019s behalf in these final weeks. \u201cWe really believed we needed to sound the alarm and do some of the events that we\u2019ve done, and I do think that in having those conversations, it has definitely moved the needle in talking about what\u2019s at stake in this election,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. In some alternate universe, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg retired during the Obama presidency and Democrats were able to push through a successor to the conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. In that universe, nobody is talking about an end to nearly 50 years of nationwide access to abortion rights. But here we are. There\u2019s a chance abortion could be illegal in much of the country in the near future since Mississippi asked the court this week to overturn Roe v. Wade. What happens if the court overturns Roe v. Wade? Mississippi is one area where availability of legal abortion would decline precipitously if the ruling is overturned. Abortion access would not simply end nationwide, but rather state laws would take over. A New York Times analysis published in May suggested access would be most affected in the American South and Midwest. Abortion could become illegal in 22 states and remain largely unchanged in 28. Ten states have passed laws that would trigger in the event Roe is overturned and automatically ban all abortions. They include both Dakotas, Idaho and Utah, and a band of states that stretches from Kentucky down to Louisiana. And some states still have laws on the books that ban abortion that would presumably revive if the case is overturned, according to the Guttmacher institute. What brings us to this moment is not a mass movement of Americans, but rather two unexpected Supreme Court deaths, some extraordinary maneuvering by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and a legal challenge by Mississippi. The Supreme Court can influence elections. Court nominations have featured to different degrees in each of the two most recent presidential elections, and in both cases the voters most motivated by the issue were supporters of the Republican candidate. Klobuchar on Breyer: 'If he's going to retire, it should be sooner rather than later' In 2016, the court was a motivating factor. There was an open seat and ideological sway of the court was in play after Scalia died. Republicans had blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland and 21% of voters said Supreme Court appointments were the most important factor in their votes, according to CNN\u2019s exit polls. A majority of those picked Donald Trump. The vote was more closely split between Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton among those who said Supreme Court appointments were not the most important thing. In 2020, the battle over the court had been won. Ginsburg had died and Barrett had solidified the new 6-3 conservative majority. A smaller portion of voters in the general election, 13%, said Supreme Court appointments were the most important factor and they more narrowly sided with Trump over Joe Biden, according to CNN\u2019s exit polls. How will the court feature next? With a safe conservative majority and without an open seat or a recently confirmed new justice, it is possible the issue of court appointments could lose some of its potency for Republicans, who now have the conservative court they long sought. Democrats, meanwhile, have made an appeal to female voters central to their platform and pitch, and a court decision that ends nationwide access to abortion services would certainly reenergize that particular issue for them, although Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s wish is that court appointments were less political, not more so. Tough nuts. Ocasio-Cortez 'inclined' to agree that Justice Breyer should retire Politics has everything to do with it and that will continue to be the case. Now-Senate Minority Leader McConnell has said it\u2019s \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Republicans would allow a Biden Supreme Court nominee to advance if they retake the majority in 2022. That is a hard no as long as he can keep his party unified. The American public in general doesn\u2019t want Roe overturned. A recent CNN review of polling on the issue included recent national polls that showed between 61% and 69% of Americans did not want to see the precedent ended. There\u2019s been steady majority support across the country for legal abortion since the mid-\u201990s. RELATED: Most Americans want to see the Supreme Court uphold Roe v. Wade, polling shows The story in individual states is different. A Pew survey in 2014 suggested that more than 70% of people in Massachusetts supported access to abortion in all or most cases, but less than 40% of people in Mississippi felt the same way. Democrats have moved more than Republicans. The partisan divide over abortion has grown in the past 15 years, according to CNN\u2019s  Ariel Edwards-Levy, who wrote in May that Democrats are moving more than Republicans on the issue: What has changed is the size of the partisan divide on the issue. Abortion has become increasingly polarized over the past 15 years, in large part because of growing support for legalized abortion among Democrats. Between 2007 and 2021, according to Pew, the share of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents supporting broadly legalized abortion rose 17 percentage points, to 80%, while the share of Republicans and Republican-leaners saying the same dipped by 4 points, falling to 35%. A timeline leading to Roe v. Wade Should Breyer retire? When Scalia died at 79 in 2016, Democrats were appalled by Republicans\u2019 ability to block Obama\u2019s nomination and saw the possibility of a new majority of liberal justices vanish. RELATED: Exclusive: Stephen Breyer says he hasn\u2019t decided his retirement plans and is happy as the Supreme Court\u2019s top liberal When Ginsburg died at 87 in 2020, they were shocked at Republicans\u2019 ability to jam through Trump\u2019s nominee and create what could be a long generation of a strong conservative majority. Proposals to expand the court and dilute the power of the conservative majority are doomed in a Senate beholden to the filibuster, although Biden has appointed a commission to study the idea. That leaves angsty liberals to be frustrated with Breyer, who won\u2019t throw in the towel and make room for a younger, perhaps fitter justice. No time line for Breyer. He has not been plagued by cancer for years like Ginsburg was, and he told CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic that at 82 \u2013 energetic, jogging, meditating and about to turn 83 \u2013 he\u2019s happy now to be the senior liberal on the Supreme Court and has no time line to retire. Wearing shorts and sandals at his vacation home in New Hampshire, he opened up to Biskupic about his satisfaction at leading the liberal justices, albeit a smaller bloc, in conference on key cases and dodged any sort of time line for his departure. Liberals struggle with Breyer's refusal to retire Since Supreme Court justices have lifetime appointments, an anomaly in democratic societies, he can pick his retirement date. But he can\u2019t pick the president or the Senate majority. And who knows when Democrats will have the White House and the Senate majority again. \u201cStephen Breyer is playing checkers and Mitch McConnell is playing chess. I mean the \u2013 the idea that he is somehow preserving the court by pretending that politics has nothing to do with the Supreme Court, you know, is just delusional,\u201d fumed Jeffrey Toobin, the CNN legal analyst, reacting to Biskupic\u2019s published interview earlier this month on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cThis is the kind of absence of strategic thinking that has done in Democrats on the Supreme Court and we\u2019ll see if it continues here,\u201d he said. What are Breyer\u2019s windows? Really, the only timeline that matters at the moment is the one that ends in January 2023, when the next Congress convenes and Republicans could take control of the Senate. If they do, Breyer would have to wait until January 2025, when he\u2019ll be 86, if he wants the possibility of a Democratic president picking his successor. If a Republican wins in 2024, he\u2019d have to wait until January 2029, when he\u2019ll be 90. And so on. Clarence Thomas, who has been on the court longer than Breyer, is just 73. Toobin writes for CNN that in the new conservative majority, Thomas is taking on a leadership role after being sidelined by previous courts. Opinion: Clarence Thomas Is the new Chief Justice \u201cIn crucial, contested cases, Chief Justice Roberts has increasingly been voting with the three remaining liberals \u2013 Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. If Roberts continues this pattern, that means Thomas will be the senior Justice in several significant 5 to 4 cases and thus enjoy the right to assign majority opinions, including, of course, to himself,\u201d Toobin writes. He also points out that Thomas openly criticized Roe v. Wade in a 2020 opinion in which Roberts sided with more liberal justices. \u201cOur abortion precedents are grievously wrong and should be overruled,\u201d Thomas wrote. The Mississippi plaintiffs borrowed that language, swapping one word, for the thrust of their argument to overturn Roe. \u201cThis Court\u2019s abortion precedents are egregiously wrong,\u201d they argued this week, an open invitation for Thomas and the conservative majority to do something about it.",

            "article_content": "Glenn Youngkin is doing everything he can to run as a Republican outsider in Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial election. But former President Donald Trump is muddling that strategy. This problem for Youngkin was highlighted on Friday when the former President \u2013 who handily lost Virginia in both 2016 and 2020 \u2013 issued a statement praising the Republican businessman and attacking Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe, who led the commonwealth from 2014 to 2018. Trump lauded Youngkin\u2019s poll numbers and called him an \u201cincredible success\u201d and \u201chighly respected person\u201d who will \u201ctruly Make Virginia Great Again,\u201d tying the Republican candidate to the President\u2019s own campaign slogan. He then went on to attack McAuliffe as a \u201cfailed and unpopular governor\u201d who took campaign donations from him and \u201cwould do whatever I wanted.\u201d In many Republican contests, a statement from Trump would be celebrated and quickly used to raise money. But in Virginia, a state that has turned on the Republican Party in recent years, the statement could just further complicate matters for the Republican candidate. \u201cTrump is deeply unpopular where Youngkin needs the votes,\u201d said Chris Saxman, a former Republican state senator who blogs about Virginia politics. Youngkin\u2019s strategy since winning the nomination earlier this year has been to cast himself as a political outsider, playing up his business background and touting himself as someone untethered to any political partisanship. \u201cLet me ask everybody a question: In our communities, in our house of worship or right here at work, does anyone really care what political party we belong to?\u201d Youngkin asks in one television ad. The businessman\u2019s public message, particularly in his paid advertising, has also focused on broad proposals aimed at the middle of the electorate \u2013 including a series of state tax and benefit policy proposals to assist military veterans that the Republican nominee announced this week \u2013 and less about the kind of culture war issues that animated Trump\u2019s tenure. Youngkin made that clear in a newly surfaced video that shows the Republican last month telling a liberal activist posing as an abortion opponent that while he could \u201cgo on offense\u201d on abortion, focusing on the issue \u201cwon\u2019t win my independent votes that I have to get.\u201d Youngkin\u2019s outsider strategy could be effective against McAuliffe, a Democrat whose decades of raising money for the party has made him the prototypical political insider. But the biggest threat to that strategy could be Trump himself, a politician who, in his quest to rebuild his political power after his 2020 loss, is eager to tie himself to Republicans on the rise like Youngkin. \u201cI\u2019m sure Youngkin\u2019s pollsters were not pleased, but his political team was glad it came out on a Friday in July,\u201d said Saxman of the Trump statement. \u201cThe base will love it and Glenn needs to get them fired up, since this is a base election, but the downside for him is that this might help McAuliffe with his base even more.\u201d McAuliffe himself and his top campaign aides have cheered any mention of Youngkin and Trump in the same sentence. Their belief: The more Trump gets involved in the Virginia race, the easier it will be for them to win. \u201cI would pay for the fuel to get Donald Trump here,\u201d McAuliffe told CNN days before he won the Democratic Party\u2019s nomination last month. The former governor noted that Trump endorsed Youngkin shortly after the Republican won the nomination and McAuliffe couldn\u2019t hide his eagerness to get the former President to Virginia. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d McAuliffe said with a laugh, \u201cI will gas up the plane.\u201d A senior McAuliffe aide told CNN that they will use the statement against Youngkin when possible, but that the tension around Trump and Youngkin just further highlights the Republican candidate has a \u201ctough balance of trying to keep the base fired up\u201d while knowing that what they want is out of step with most Virginia voters. \u201cThat is their core challenge, which is going to be continually tough for them,\u201d the aide said. The Democratic Governors Association responded to the Trump statement with a simple question: \u201cWhen\u2019s the Trump-Youngkin rally in Virginia?\u201d Youngkin\u2019s campaign responded to the Trump statement by accusing the former Democratic governor of being tied to Trump himself. \u201cTerry McAuliffe knows he can\u2019t beat Glenn Youngkin, which is why he is so desperate to run against someone else,\u201d said Matt Wolking, Youngkin\u2019s communications director and a former Trump aide. \u201cThe trouble for Terry is that he\u2019s a total fraud who took $25,000 from Donald Trump, hugged Donald Trump, toasted Donald Trump, and now pretends like he hasn\u2019t been friends with him for nearly three decades.\u201d CNN reported in 2009 that Trump cut McAuliffe a $25,000 check during his failed bid for governor that year. Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said that the more Trump backs Youngkin, the more the Republican candidate\u2019s team should be worried. \u201cIt\u2019s all about Trump. He couldn\u2019t care about Youngkin for Youngkin\u2019s sake. He wants to associate himself with what he thinks will be a winner, but in fact he is making it less likely he will win,\u201d said Sabato. \u201c(Youngkin) doesn\u2019t need this unwanted help from Donald Trump. But he\u2019s got it and it\u2019s yet another albatross around his neck \u2013 with a Trump symbol.\u201d John Fredericks, a Virginia-based talk-radio host who chaired Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns in the state, said he believes Youngkin has done a good job so far of walking the difficult tightrope of running as a Republican in a fairly anti-Trump state. \u201cWhat he needs to do is hold the very motivated Trump base in Virginia together and inspire that enthusiasm while also attempting to distance himself from some of the Trump personality idiosyncrasies that turned off some of the Virginia big-market suburbanite women,\u201d said Fredericks. \u201cThat\u2019s a tall order.\u201d Fredericks noted that Trump has a particular fondness for Virginia \u2013 the former president owns both a golf club and a winery in the state \u2013 that explains his outspokenness on the race. \u201cMcAuliffe is going to run against Trump anyway,\u201d Fredericks said, \u201cso there\u2019s really no downside to the president saying nice things that are authentic about Glenn.\u201d CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to more clearly reflect the senior McAuliffe aide\u2019s thoughts on Youngkin\u2019s campaign dealing with Trump\u2019s statement in support of their candidate.",

            "article_content": "The Republican Party is no longer about conservatism. It\u2019s about slavish devotion to Donald Trump and his fact-free fantasy that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Witness what\u2019s happening right now in Oklahoma \u2013 where Sen. James Lankford is facing a rebellion within his party because, well, he refused to cast a vote objecting to the Electoral College results in Pennsylvania and Arizona following the riot at the US Capitol. According to the Tulsa World, Oklahoma Republican Party chairman John Bennett is not only supporting Lankford\u2019s primary opponent \u2013 Jackson Lahmeyer \u2013 but was also in attendance at a rally organized by Lahmeyer late last month that featured former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn as well as Mark McCloskey, the pistol-packing Missouri man who became famous for \u201cprotecting\u201d his home during a peaceful protest. Several people who were part of the January 6 insurrection were also featured at the rally. Bennett\u2019s lack of neutrality in the primary didn\u2019t sit well with Lankford. \u201cIt\u2019s more unheard of than it is rare,\u201d he told the World. \u201cI\u2019d say it\u2019s highly unusual for a state party chair in any state in America to come out and say, \u2018I\u2019m not going to at least be neutral.\u2019\u201d Which is true! There\u2019s no law that bans a state party chairman from endorsing a candidate in a primary, it\u2019s just very rarely done \u2013 especially by someone as new to the job as Bennett. Bennett, a former state legislator, was elected to the post in April. Prior to winning the job, Bennett spent nearly a decade in the Oklahoma state House of Representatives, a tenure defined by his controversial comments about Islam and unapologetic conservative views on guns and abortion. (Bennett once called Islam \u201ca cancer in our nation that needs to be cut out.\u201d) Bennett appears to have found common cause with Lahmeyer, who is centering his challenge to Lankford on the debunked idea that the 2020 election was somehow fraudulent and that Trump actually won. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201c(Election integrity) is the number one issue that faces this country,\u201d Lahmeyer told the Norman Transcript late last month. \u201cElection integrity is monumental. We have to have confidence, whether we win or whether we lose \u2014 we win some battles, we will lose some battles, that\u2019s how politics goes \u2014 but you have to have confidence that the election was fair and the election was legal.\u201d The Big Lie, as the 2020 election rejection of Trump and his allies has come to be known, appears to be the only issue on which Lahmeyer is running. That Lankford didn\u2019t join the eight other Republican senators who objected to the Electoral College vote in either Pennsylvania or Arizona appears to be enough of a reason for Lahmeyer (and Bennett). Which is remarkable. Particularly when you consider that Lankford, who was first elected to the Senate in a 2014 special election, has compiled one of the most conservative voting records in the chamber. In 2020, Lankford scored a 95% rating by the American Conservative Union, making him the 2nd most conservative senator in Washington. He has a 98% rating so far in this Congress from Heritage Action, another major conservative group in Washington. Even when it comes to Trump loyalty \u2013 which is obviously a very different thing than adherence to conservative principles \u2013 Lankford scores well. He voted in line with Trump 86.8% of the time, according to data from 538. That\u2019s higher than people like Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley (86.7%), Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson (86%) and Florida Sen. Rick Scott (84.1%). What\u2019s abundantly clear here is that Lankford\u2019s only problem \u2013 at least in the eyes of some within the Oklahoma GOP (including the party chair!) \u2013 is that he refused to object to the certification of Electoral College votes in an election in which there is zero evidence of any sort of widespread voter fraud. Because Lankford wouldn\u2019t go along with Trump\u2019s wild conspiracy theory, he is insufficiently loyal to the former president and deserves to be punished. Despite all of this Sturm und Drang, Lankford is still very likely to win the Republican nomination next year. The incumbent had more than $1 million in the bank as of March 31, dwarfing Lahmeyer\u2019s $33,000. That we are even talking about Lankford\u2019s political prospects in a state as ruby red as Oklahoma (and considering his strongly conservative voting record) speaks to the power of the Big Lie \u2013 and to the obeisance of today\u2019s Republican Party to Trump over any conservative principle.",

            "article_content": "Congress is out of session with lawmakers back home for the holiday recess \u2013 a traditional time for fireworks, parades, and yes, politicking. The fight for control of the evenly divided Senate will be the most dramatic showdown of 2022, and based on the candidates who have jumped in so far \u2013 and those who are expected to \u2013 there are a few changes to this month\u2019s ranking of the Senate seats most likely to flip partisan control. Pennsylvania \u2013 an open-seat race in a state that President Joe Biden carried in 2020 \u2013 remains the most likely to flip. But four other states have moved around slightly. The top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip are based on CNN\u2019s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. As the cycle heats up, polling and advertising spending data will also become factors. Our ranking first published in March, was updated in April and again in May. Two other Biden states are trading places, with New Hampshire leapfrogging above Nevada. It\u2019s true that Biden carried the Granite State by a wider margin, but the potential GOP candidate options there are enough to move it above the Silver State for now. Of course, that could change if two big name Republicans in New Hampshire pass on the race. Two Trump states are also switching spots. Florida is now above Ohio in terms of likelihood of flipping. Democrats have done better recently at the presidential level in Florida than they have in Ohio, and that\u2019s all the more relevant now that Democratic Rep. Val Demings is running against Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Democrats already had a candidate in Ohio \u2013 Rep. Tim Ryan \u2013 but the increasingly red state is tougher terrain for the party. However, this is fluid \u2013 it\u2019s still possible that the messy GOP primary in the Buckeye State will be just the opening Democrats need. Ohio is a prime example of how former President Donald Trump continues to hold enormous sway over the GOP, with Republican Senate candidates competing for the attention of his supporters at his rally in the state late last month. Trump\u2019s endorsement may not be enough to force other candidates to drop out (see North Carolina), but the idea of running without his backing in a GOP primary does seem to be enough to keep some candidates from jumping in (see Georgia). The start of July marks the beginning of a new fundraising period, which means more candidates are likely to launch their campaigns, having waited until the end of the second quarter so as not to report a lower total from an incomplete quarter. Check back here for CNN\u2019s next ranking, which will be updated after second quarter fundraising reports are filed later this month. Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) Pennsylvania \u2013 where GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for another term \u2013 remains the seat most likely to flip, in large part, because it\u2019s an open seat in a state that Biden carried last fall. And while this race may come down to whatever the national environment looks like next year, Democrats regard it as their top pick up opportunity \u2013 even if they don\u2019t yet know who their candidate is going to be. An already big field could get even more crowded with Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb thought to be closely eying the race. At least two potential candidates, fellow Reps. Madeleine Dean and Chrissy Houlahan, did take themselves out of the running. EMILY\u2019s List, the pro-abortion rights powerhouse, backed Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh. The group is often a powerful player in Democratic primaries, including in another Democratic Senate primary here in 2016. The biggest name, however, remains Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, the progressive former mayor of Braddock and a big fundraiser. Most of the Republican sparring has been between Army veteran Sean Parnell, who ran and lost against Lamb last year, and Jeff Bartos, a wealthy businessman who loaned his campaign $400,000 during the first quarter. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock Republicans are eager to redeem their trifecta of recent losses in Georgia. But they\u2019re still in a waiting game when it comes to who will avenge the loss to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who\u2019s now running for a full six-year term. That\u2019s because Herschel Walker, encouraged by Trump to run, continues to have a freezing effect on the field. Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black announced his candidacy in early June, becoming one of the most prominent candidates so far, while other Republicans have been reluctant to jump into the race if they know someone else will have Trump\u2019s backing. Former Rep. Doug Collins, for example, already passed on a run. Walker, who lives in Texas, teased a campaign with a June 17 video of him revving the engine of a car with Peach State license plates (in a garage). \u201cI\u2019m getting ready,\u201d the former NFL running back said. Trump said in a radio interview last week that Walker told him he\u2019s decided to run. GOP strategists, however, are nervous about a risky candidate jeopardizing a must-win seat. Other Republicans are still testing the waters. Former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who lost to Warnock in the January runoff, recently tweeted about meeting with Trump. And she met with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, too, telling CNN in mid June, \u201cI haven\u2019t ruled it out.\u201d Rep. Buddy Carter, who\u2019s friends with Walker, is waiting to see what Walker does before making a decision. While everyone waits on Walker, national Republicans are not wasting time attacking one of their top targets. The National Republican Senatorial Committee has hit Warnock on TV for supporting the For the People Act, the sweeping voting and elections bill they dub \u201cthe welfare for politicians plan\u201d (because of a public financing provision). Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is keeping everyone guessing \u2013 will he run for a third term? His indecision could be putting a possible successor at a disadvantage if he decides not to run. Johnson is the only Republican potentially running for reelection in a state Biden carried last year, so the seat is a top target for Democrats, regardless of whether he runs or not. Given some of the disinformation and conspiracy theories Johnson has peddled about the coronavirus and vaccines, the 2020 election and the January 6 insurrection, Wisconsin is the rare state where Democrats may feel more confident running against a two-term incumbent than they would an unknown Republican. They\u2019ve got a handful of decent candidates, with Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes making moves too. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly Republicans are no longer without candidates to take on Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, who is running for a full six-year term after winning last fall. Several contenders have recently jumped in the race, including Attorney General Mark Brnovich, with others still considering. That\u2019s a relief to party operatives who feared that without Gov. Doug Ducey running, they\u2019d be left scrambling in one of their top pick-up opportunities. But Democrats are gleefully anticipating a messy primary, where Republicans are forced to cater to the Trump base (and show support for a partisan-driven audit), only to have to make a quick pivot to a general election audience next fall. Still, Republicans believe Kelly, an astronaut and the husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords, is beatable \u2013 despite his compelling personal story and impressive fundraising. That\u2019s because he\u2019ll have a voting record this time \u2013 and the national party is already trying to use that against him. Republicans are also using the state\u2019s other Democratic senator, moderate Kyrsten Sinema, as a foil to try to make Kelly look too liberal. \u201cStand with Senator Sinema against the liberal partisans,\u201d blared one recent ad about the filibuster from the outside GOP-aligned group One Nation. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) The biggest news in North Carolina was Trump\u2019s surprise endorsement of Rep. Ted Budd to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr. Trump did it on stage at the state GOP convention just minutes after his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said she was passing on the race. Budd, a gun store and range owner, emerged from a 17-way primary in 2016, winning his House seat with the backing of the Club for Growth, which is supporting him in this race, too. But Trump\u2019s endorsement isn\u2019t clearing the field in this race. Former Gov. Pat McCrory and former Rep. Mark Walker, who were both in the crowd when Trump made his announcement, are still running. On the Democratic side, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley has the backing of EMILY\u2019s List. But state Sen. Jeff Jackson and former state Sen. Erica Smith are still running too. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan First-term Sen. Maggie Hassan is still without a top tier challenger, but this race moves up one spot on the list. Republicans know exactly who they want to run here \u2013 and even if he doesn\u2019t do it, the GOP may have a back up. Gov. Chris Sununu had originally said he\u2019d make a decision after the end of the legislative session in June, but he seems to have pushed back his timeline, telling \u201cGood Morning New Hampshire\u201d last month, \u201cI won\u2019t make a decision for a really long time.\u201d He does have time \u2013 Hassan, in her last run, didn\u2019t announce until October 2015 \u2013 and unlike some other candidates making up their minds in other states, he doesn\u2019t need to introduce himself to voters since he\u2019s the sitting governor. In the event he doesn\u2019t run, former Sen. Kelly Ayotte \u2013 who lost to Hassan by just 1,017 votes in 2016 \u2013 could run instead. Republicans are convinced that Hassan, herself a former two-term governor, isn\u2019t as well-defined as she should be. They\u2019re trying to attack her for backing the For the People Act (also going after the public finance part of the legislation). But it\u2019s not just her record that\u2019s being attacked. Democrats think Sununu just handed them a potent weapon with his signature of a budget with new abortion restrictions. They argue that could be politically perilous for a Republican in a state that voted for Biden by 7 points and has trended more blue in federal elections recently. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto Nevada slides down the list because first-term Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, the country\u2019s first Latina senator, largely has this race to herself, with Republicans waiting on former Attorney General Adam Laxalt to get in. Biden carried Nevada by less of a margin than he did New Hampshire \u2013 only 2 points \u2013 but Laxalt doesn\u2019t quite have the profile of Sununu and it\u2019s not clear the GOP has a back-up option here. Republicans think he could motivate the base and gain traction as a former statewide elected official, while Democrats are eager to tie him to Trump and his efforts to overturn the election. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio This race moves up one spot on the list of seats most likely to flip because Democratic Rep. Val Demings is now running, giving GOP Sen. Marco Rubio a formidable opponent (assuming she wins the Democratic primary). Florida trades places with Ohio, which was originally ranked higher because Democrats had a candidate in that race earlier. Florida, by the numbers, however, is a more viable state for Democrats than Ohio \u2014 Biden lost the Sunshine State by 3 points and the Buckeye State by 8 points. That\u2019s not to say Rubio will be easy to beat. The two-term senator starts the race with the advantage, and some Republicans think they dodged a bullet when Rep. Stephanie Murphy, a more moderate Democrat, passed on the race. But Demings, a former social worker and Orlando police chief who was a vice presidential contender for Biden, brings a strong profile to the race \u2013 one that could potentially blunt the ubiquitous Republican attacks on Democrats for being soft on crime and wanting to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) The already crowded GOP primary to replace retiring Sen. Rob Portman got another candidate on Thursday when \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author JD Vance officially entered the race. And he\u2019s not just a famous author (whose book has been turned into a movie). He comes with the backing of a super PAC that already has a $10 million commitment from PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. In a primary that has so far been all about loyalty to Trump, however, those outside connections may only get him so far. He\u2019ll have to navigate attacks over his public opposition to Trump in 2016, for example. Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan, meanwhile, has a pretty clear lane to run in while the Republicans duke it out amongst themselves. Even so, this race slides down one spot in terms of likelihood of flipping, switching places with Florida, where the fundamentals of the state are more favorable to Democrats, especially now that they have a big-name candidate running. Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring) With her announcement in June, Rep. Vicky Hartzler became one of the latest Republicans running to replace retiring Sen. Roy Blunt. But the main reason this seat, in a state Trump carried by 15 points, is remotely competitive is because of one of the other candidates: former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct. His candidacy is giving Democrats hope that they could contest this ruby red state, while giving Republicans heartburn about another possible Todd Akin situation. (The 2012 Senate candidate\u2019s comments about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d cost them the seat and imperiled other Republicans around the country.) And the more Republicans who run in Missouri, the more the primary vote will be splintered, potentially lowering the threshold that Greitens would need to win the nomination. (State Senate Republicans had been trying to create a runoff rule that would apply for next year). But for now, the intrigue here is trying to figure out whose constituency will cut into whose. Hartzler, who once introduced an amendment to block the military from paying for gender reassignment surgery or hormone therapy for both service members and their families, courts Christian conservatives. But she has plenty of company trying to appeal to the Trump base. Attorney General Eric Schmitt is running, as is Mark McCloskey, who, along with his wife, recently pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges after they pointed their guns at people protesting racial injustice near their home last year. Several members of the congressional delegation are still eying the race, too.",

            "article_content": "Every day another voice adds to the groundswell of pressure on 82-year-old Justice Stephen Breyer to retire when the annual Supreme Court session ends in a few weeks. But implicit in the comments, such as Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s warning this week that he may block a Democratic Supreme Court nominee should Republicans win the Senate in the November 2022 midterm elections, is a premise that Breyer actually still has another full term to make a decision. And he just might take it. Nothing Breyer has said publicly suggests the 27-year veteran is ready to leave the work of the court just yet. Liberal-funded ads call for Justice Stephen Breyer to retire He seems in vigorous health, unlike some retirees in recent years or the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose September 2020 death allowed then-President Donald Trump to place a third appointee on the bench. Breyer, who jogs and meditates, has remained visible on the speaking circuit during the Covid pandemic via Zoom. RELATED: Liberal-funded ads call for Justice Stephen Breyer to retire Breyer also has a special interest in cases the justices are scheduled to hear next session, including on abortion rights and gun control. He has authored crucial, narrowly won abortion rights decisions in recent years. He has also supported affirmative action programs, and the court may be poised next term to take up a case challenging Harvard admission practices that have traditionally benefited Black and Latino students. When the conservative majority in 2007 struck down integration plans in Seattle and Louisville, Kentucky, public school districts, Breyer wrote, \u201cThis is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret.\u201d Right now, Breyer appears to be tuning out the will-he-or-won\u2019t-he commentary, working to finish his opinions for the 2020-21 term and sending no signals that he is ready to pack up his book-lined chambers. (He declines public questions on the retirement issue and is holding his thoughts, one way or another, close.) Obamacare, LGBTQ rights, voting laws in play during Supreme Court's final month Justices have been known to engage in late-June recalibration, as in 2005, when Sandra Day O\u2019Connor suddenly announced her retirement (on July 1) when she discovered that Chief Justice William Rehnquist, battling thyroid cancer, was not stepping down. (Justices are loath to cause two vacancies at the same time, fearing that could impede the work of the court.) In 2018, Justice Anthony Kennedy decided to retire but left most of his colleagues in the dark until after they had descended the bench on their last June day. Kennedy, who had confided in Chief Justice John Roberts, told the others during a session in their private conference room. Breyer served as a counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee early in his career and has remained attuned to the politics of the chamber. He would know that President Joe Biden\u2019s best shot for confirming a Supreme Court nominee would occur with a Democratic-led Senate. Yet Breyer would be reluctant to succumb to politically driven pleas. In an expansive speech at Harvard recently, he emphasized the importance of shielding the judiciary from politics to foster confidence in the court\u2019s decisions. He lamented that people sometimes view the justices as \u201cjunior league\u201d politicians and criticized the Senate confirmation process. \u201cSenators will often describe a nominee they oppose as too \u2018liberal\u2019 or too \u2018conservative,\u2019 \u201d Breyer said. \u201cWhat they say, reported by the press to their constituents, reinforces the view that politics, not legal merits, drives Supreme Court decisions.\u201d Trump\u2019s choice of Brett Kavanaugh to succeed Kennedy, along with Amy Coney Barrett\u2019s succession of Ginsburg, have moved the court significantly to the right and raised the stakes for the law in America. A Biden-appointed successor for Breyer, either this year or next, would not change the current 6-3 conservative-liberal makeup. But some Democrats fear risking a greater slide to the right if Biden is not able to replace Breyer with a younger liberal soon. Since January, liberal law professors have been urging Breyer to retire this year. Advocacy groups on the left have been broadcasting similar pleas, and some Democratic members of Congress have joined in as well. Senate votes to confirm key Biden judicial nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson On Sunday, Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that she thought Breyer should retire at the end of this term. Two days later, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow, Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California said he agreed with Ocasio-Cortez but added that he thought Breyer should retire \u201cprior to the midterms.\u201d McConnell\u2019s warning about possible obstruction of a Biden Supreme Court choice is similarly tied to the midterms. When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked the Senate minority leader whether he would allow confirmation of a Biden justice in the 2024 presidential election year if the GOP wins the Senate next year, McConnell said, \u201cI think it\u2019s highly unlikely.\u201d The Kentucky Republican would not commit, during the Monday interview, to allowing confirmation in 2023, either. He ducked the 2023 question again when asked by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Tuesday. Liberals worry about what happens before the November 2022 elections. Many have been shaken by the increasing conservatism on the court, including the three Trump appointees, and raise the possibility that the Democrats could lose their fragile one-vote Senate majority, through a death. The current clash of interests would not be lost on top Biden administration officials, who have unparalleled firsthand experience in nomination battles. As a senator, Biden oversaw Judiciary Committee hearings for Supreme Court candidates, including the 1987 fight involving Robert Bork (defeated by the Senate 58-42) and the 1991 fight over Clarence Thomas (confirmed 52-48). At Biden\u2019s side for many contentious hearings was former committee counsel and current White House chief of staff Ron Klain. He later moved into the executive branch and helped guide the Supreme Court choices of Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. But Merrick Garland, Biden\u2019s attorney general, experienced the process most personally and painfully, as a high court nominee denied any Senate consideration after Obama put up his name in March 2016 as a successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia. (Trump filled the vacancy in early 2017 with Neil Gorsuch.) For Democrats, that ordeal offers a reminder of how, even when a timeline appears safe, no bets are safe.",

            "article_content": "Mitch McConnell just did it again. The Senate minority leader, whose dubious maneuvering to turn the Supreme Court to the far right still haunts liberals, just previewed a fresh scheme to bolster conservative judicial supremacy on the nation\u2019s top bench for years to come, with widespread consequences for all three branches of government. The Republican veteran indicated Monday he would implement his self-declared rule and refuse to confirm a Supreme Court nominee picked by President Joe Biden in election year 2024 if the GOP wins the Senate next year. \u201cI think it\u2019s highly unlikely,\u201d McConnell said when asked on Hugh Hewitt\u2019s conservative radio show if Biden would get a pick. In fact, the Kentucky power player didn\u2019t even guarantee he would allow the confirmation of a Biden nominee in 2023 either. McConnell\u2019s foreshadowing will undoubtedly set off sirens for Democrats across Washington who hear the remarks as a reminder that the clock has already started both on moving their ambitious agenda through a narrowly divided Congress and keeping what few seats they have left on the high court. McConnell is returning to his self-coined principle \u2013 that is mentioned nowhere in the Constitution \u2013 that at a certain point of their term a President no longer has the right to seat a Supreme Court nominee. The then-Senate majority leader used this ruse to thwart President Barack Obama\u2019s pick Merrick Garland for eight months before the election in 2016. But with a Republican, Donald Trump, in the White House in 2020, he muscled Amy Coney Barrett onto the high court eight days before the election \u2013 after hypocritically discovering an exception to his own rule that came into operation if the Senate and the White House were in hands of the same party. As his comments on Monday built on that history, McConnell sent a warning to Democrats already struggling to coalesce over passing Biden\u2019s first-year agenda that has foundered on tough Senate math. In effect, he set a timer on the moment when Democrats could lose their short window on congressional power at the 2024 election. And with the kind of cynical clarity that only an expert and ruthless political operator can muster, he underscored just how high the stakes are next year. Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley from Oregon warned that McConnell\u2019s warning raised the specter of another theft of a Supreme Court seat. \u201cThe damage to the Court is enormous, it turns into \u2026 a partisan warfare. He has put this on steroids that is an order of magnitude that is more intense now,\u201d Merkley said on \u201cCuomo Prime Time.\u201d \u201cWhat can we do? Well, we can make sure that McConnell is not in the majority in \u201923 and \u201824 because \u2026 when he was in the majority he\u2019s played this game before and his party rewarded him for it.\u201d Merrick Garland says he'll enforce DOJ's pledge against spying on journalists In retrospect, McConnell\u2019s blockade of Garland in 2016 was one of the earliest gambits in what has become a consistent pattern of Republican attacks on Washington norms by the GOP. While no fan of Trump, McConnell\u2019s goal is always the capturing or the preservation of power. His recent refusal to allow the Senate to establish an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the insurrection on January 6, shows how he is willing to appease Trump\u2019s base to that end. But it is also the kind of behavior that has America\u2019s allies abroad fretting at the constant erosion of US constitutional guardrails, even as Biden tours Europe warning that democracy is under siege abroad. McConnell\u2019s invoking of his spoiler move against Garland also struck an ironic note on Monday. The former judge would have been on the bench for more than five years by now were it not for the minority leader\u2019s action. Instead, he was selected by Biden to be attorney general, and is now faced with the task of dealing with a political storm over the Trump administration\u2019s apparent use of the Justice Department to target an enemies list including Democratic congressman and media organizations including CNN. Those abuses were among those encouraged by the failure of McConnell\u2019s GOP ever to rein in Trump. In the next few days, McConnell\u2019s Machiavellian intervention is sure to supercharge speculation among Democrats about the timing of the possible retirement of liberal Justice Stephen Breyer. If Democrats cannot replace Breyer, 82, on the Court this year or next while they have the slimmest possible margin in the Senate, they risk a 7-2 conservative majority if future elections go the GOP\u2019s way and Breyer eventually leaves the court. That would mean decades of right-wing jurisprudence, no matter what voters want. Senate votes to confirm key Biden judicial nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson Nervousness over Breyer\u2019s intentions was already running at high levels in Washington as the end of the current Supreme Court term approaches, the moment when some previous Justices have retired. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, progressive Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said that she believed that given the circumstances, Breyer should make his exit. \u201cI would probably lean towards yes,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. Speculating about a Supreme Court Justice\u2019s future is a sensitive business and in questionable taste given Breyer\u2019s age \u2013 although there is no sign he is in fragile health. In the rarified marble halls of the building hosting the nation\u2019s top bench, such talk may also offend and backfire \u2013 one reason why many Democrats are tiptoeing around the issue in public. But it is not an exaggeration to say that the death in office of liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg shortly before Trump lost the election was a disaster for liberals and fundamentally reshaped the nation. Democrats are desperate that the same thing doesn\u2019t happen again, one reason why they hope Breyer retires while Biden still has a good chance of replacing him. It wouldn\u2019t be a sure thing in a 50-50 Senate. But a Biden nominee ought to squeak through. Most political strategists believe McConnell\u2019s work in holding a Supreme Court seat open in 2016 helped galvanize social conservative turnout around Trump, despite his lack of a long record of support for such causes and a checkered personal life. It is possible that this time McConnell\u2019s goading could serve to fire up Democratic activists and stoke liberal turnout in the midterms. It\u2019s curious however that the Supreme Court has never seemed to motivate progressives during elections in the same way it got conservatives to the polls. Maybe a conservative majority for years to come will change that. Another result of McConnell\u2019s lightning rod comments may be to inflame Democratic angst and perhaps worsen simmering conflicts between the party\u2019s progressives and moderates already hampering hopes for Biden\u2019s agenda. His warning is already fueling concerns among liberals about attempts by the President to conclude a bipartisan infrastructure deal well below his initial specifications. After all, the case for doing a deal with Republicans whose leader is plotting to not just derail his presidency but is showing his hand in yet another bid to reshape the Supreme Court will be hard for liberals to take. The Senate minority leader\u2019s comments are also adding fresh momentum to the vocal but so far thwarted attempts by liberals to convince Democratic moderates to abolish Senate 60-vote filibuster rules that enable McConnell to use his minority to thwart Biden\u2019s ambitious legislative plans. \u201cSenator McConnell is single-mindedly focused on protecting the broken status quo that preserves his power and benefits his special interest allies,\u201d said Eli Zupnick, spokesperson for Fix Our Senate, a coalition of groups seeking reform of the chamber. \u201cThis is just one more reminder that the filibuster must be eliminated as a partisan weapon Sen. McConnell can wield to continue his gridlock and obstruction.\u201d The most fascinating thing about McConnell\u2019s interview with Hewitt was that the longtime senator was talking as if he was the one in power, rather than Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. But in a way, he is, given the weight granted to the minority in the Senate by the filibuster. Many Democrats worry that if they don\u2019t remove the need for a 60-vote supermajority to pass their agenda, McConnell would do so in a future GOP Senate to pass a right-wing wish list of laws on guns, abortion and tax reform if the GOP also controls the House. But he insisted that he was committed to Senate traditions. \u201cIt requires us to have a 60-vote majority to do things. That\u2019s been the way the Senate\u2019s been for quite a long time. President Trump wanted me to get rid of it, and I said politely, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going to do that,\u2019 \u201d McConnell told Hewitt. Such respect for the Senate is seen by many of McConnell\u2019s critics as conflicting with his handling of Supreme Court nominees. After all, McConnell responded to Democrats eliminating the filibuster for judicial picks by applying the exception to Supreme Court justices. That move as majority leader in 2017 paved the way for what is likely to be his most lasting legacy \u2013 a conservative Supreme Court that endures for years. For such a prize, he\u2019ll happily endure no end of liberal condemnation.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s plans to play GOP kingmaker are being disrupted by one of his most loyal supporters in Georgia. In early May at Mar-a-Lago, Trump met with Georgia state Sen. Burt Jones and Jones\u2019 father, a wealthy pro-Trump donor, and said he wanted the younger Jones to run for governor against Brian Kemp in the Republican primary. With the former President\u2019s backing, Jones could knock off the first-term governor, one of Trump\u2019s top political targets. But by the end of the meeting, Jones made it known to Trump he was unsure about taking on Kemp and that he preferred to run for lieutenant governor, according to four people familiar with the meeting. Trump\u2019s failure to recruit Jones would be a blow to the former President\u2019s vendetta against Kemp, the otherwise pro-Trump stalwart who nonetheless refused the Trump\u2019s calls to intervene and overturn his defeat in Georgia. It also highlights the limits to Trump\u2019s power to pick and choose his candidates to ensure the Republican Party remains in his grip through the 2022 midterms and beyond. Since meeting with Trump, Jones is even more likely to seek the open lieutenant governor seat, two of those people told CNN. Jones said he would announce his plans to run for higher office \u201csoon\u201d in a statement provided to CNN. The statement criticized other state Republican leaders, including the secretary of state and the retiring lieutenant governor, but mentioned neither Kemp nor the governor\u2019s race. \u201cI will be running to protect the integrity of every legal vote, to protect Georgia taxpayers, and to protect the progress made under the Trump administration,\u201d Jones said. \u201cMy job will be to hold myself accountable to the voters of Georgia, not to political insiders and elected officials in Atlanta or Washington, DC.\u201d Running for lieutenant governor is the right call, the two Georgia Republicans say, both for the ambitious 42-year-old Republican\u2019s future and for a state GOP trying to rebound from a disappointing and frustrating 2020 election. Elsewhere, Trump\u2019s grip is tenuous. His animosity toward Sen. Lisa Murkowksi, for example, has not stopped the National Republican Senatorial Committee from backing the Alaska Republican in her reelection bid next year. And the former President\u2019s surprise endorsement last weekend of Rep. Ted Budd for an open Senate seat in North Carolina has not yet driven the two other major Republicans vying for the nomination from the race. Trump\u2019s focus on disloyal Georgia Republicans is particularly notable, given the prominence the Peach State plays in the former president\u2019s false narrative that the 2020 election was stolen. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, received the brunt of Trump\u2019s anger about his loss in the state by fewer than 12,000 votes. In a January 2 phone call with Raffensperger, Trump asked the secretary of state to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes for Trump to make up the difference \u2013 a request the Georgia Republican rejected. Raffensperger now faces a formidable primary challenge from Rep. Jody Hice, whom Trump has endorsed. \u201cUnlike the current Georgia Secretary of State, Jody leads out front with integrity,\u201d Trump said in a statement in March. \u201cJody will stop the Fraud and get honesty into our Elections!\u201d Trump made a similar appeal to Kemp, asking in a phone call in December 2020 for the Georgia governor to convene state legislators to select pro-Trump electors. Kemp, who had already approved the certification of Georgia\u2019s electoral votes for Joe Biden, told Trump he had no authority to do anything to change the election results. Trump blasted Kemp as a \u201cRINO\u201d and later said he was \u201cashamed\u201d to have endorsed him in 2018. During an appearance in Georgia before the Senate runoff elections in January, Trump vowed to campaign against Kemp before the 2022 primary. But that\u2019s proving a more difficult task than it might have seemed in the weeks and months following the last election. \u201cStatewide, [Kemp\u2019s] numbers are better than one would think,\u201d said one Georgia Republican consultant who requested anonymity to speak freely about the internal party dynamics. \u201cIf I were advising anybody, I\u2019m not so certain that I would advise them that it\u2019s wise to run against Brian Kemp.\u201d Republicans there say that Kemp has some vulnerabilities with the most hardcore part of Trump\u2019s base; at last weekend\u2019s state party convention, some in the crowd booed Kemp. But the 57-year-old governor has managed his relationships within the state party well. Notably, he\u2019s one of the few high-profile Republicans in Trump\u2019s crosshairs who has not been censured by his state party. (Raffensperger, on the other hand, was censured at the recent party convention.) Importantly, Kemp\u2019s pursuit of conservative agenda items in areas like election law and abortion and his record on economic growth have helped him parry the Trump attacks over the 2020 election. \u201cThe problem for the Trump-only wing of the GOP is that Kemp has actually been really good on all their issues,\u201d said Erick Erickson, the Atlanta-based conservative talk-radio host. \u201cAnd by being attacked by Trump while not responding, Kemp looks like a statesman, and the suburban voters who were scared of him in 2018 like him now.\u201d Last December, Trump publicly floated that outgoing Rep. Doug Collins could run for governor. But Collins, who had unsuccessfully run for the Senate in last year\u2019s special election, announced in April he would not be running for any office in 2022. And while former state Rep. Vernon Jones (no relation to Burt Jones), who is close to several in Trump\u2019s orbit, got into the race for governor in April, Trump has not yet backed him. A former Democrat, Jones was a fixture at Trump campaign rallies and spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2020. He switched parties this year and has become a vocal avatar for the right wing of the Republican base. CJ Pearson, Vernon Jones\u2019s campaign manager, told CNN that Jones spoke with Trump last month and that the former President could still endorse him. \u201cThe President is taking his time, and we respect that. We\u2019re committed to earning his support,\u201d Pearson said. Even so, Jones is not viewed credibly by many Trump allies. Georgia Republicans who spoke to CNN say the lack of endorsement from Trump at this point suggests it may never come. The gubernatorial race is not the only one where Trump has intervened in Georgia and so far come up short. In March, Trump publicly called on football great Herschel Walker to run for the Georgia Senate seat currently held by Democrat Raphael Warnock \u2013 a move that has effectively frozen the GOP field in place. Potential candidates, such as Rep. Buddy Carter, have said they will wait to decide on the race until Walker declares, while other, like Collins, stayed away. But Georgia Republicans are increasingly concerned Walker\u2019s indecision is hobbling the party\u2019s ability to find and field the right candidate to take on Warnock in 2022. All of it has Democrats in the state cautiously optimistic. One Georgia Democratic strategist who spoke to CNN said Trump deserves credit for Biden\u2019s victory in November and the January runoff wins that gave Democrats the Senate majority. As the Democrats\u2019 2018 gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams weighs a possible rematch with Kemp next year, the strategist said it\u2019s possible the Trump-fueled disarray could be another opening for the party. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s interventions or personal grievances or personal vendettas keep handing Democrats in the state opportunity after opportunity,\u201d said the strategist.",

            "article_content": "The midterm elections are still 18 months away, but the fight for control of the Senate is already shaping what gets done in the nation\u2019s capital this year. In an evenly divided Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris gives Democrats the tie-breaking vote, every vote matters. That\u2019s proven to be a crucial consideration for President Joe Biden as he tried to pass his Covid-19 relief plan and now his infrastructure and jobs proposals. Looking ahead to next year, that means every Senate race matters. Republicans only need to flip one seat to take back the majority, while Democrats are eager to cushion their majority by picking off a few more seats currently held by GOP senators. Democrats\u2019 best opportunity to do that is in Pennsylvania, which CNN ranks the seat most likely to flip partisan control for the third month in a row. The top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip are based on CNN\u2019s reporting and fundraising data, as well as historical data about how states and candidates have performed. As the cycle heats up, polling and advertising spending data will also become factors. Our ranking first published in March and was updated in April. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican, is not running for reelection, which means it\u2019s up to the GOP to hold this seat without him. Biden carried the state by about 1 point last fall, making it a natural place for Democrats to try to flip a seat. Their next best chance to is in Wisconsin, another state Biden won that\u2019s currently held by a Republican, Sen. Ron Johnson, who may or may not be running for reelection. Republicans\u2019 best opportunities to flip seats are in Georgia and Arizona \u2013 two traditionally red states that Biden carried last year where recently elected Democratic senators, Raphael Warnock and Mark Kelly, are now running for full six-year terms. But the universe of competitive seats remains relatively small. Of the 34 seats up for election next fall, only eight are considered \u201cbattlegrounds\u201d by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Still, the GOP\u2019s fidelity to former President Donald Trump could complicate their ability to defeat Democrats in demographically changing Biden states. Even months after he left the White House, the ex-President looms over the GOP. Look no further than congressional Republicans\u2019 unwillingness to establish a commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection. And across the country, primaries continue to look like Trump loyalty contests. Republicans\u2019 biggest problem right now, however, is that they lack candidates in those states to take advantage of what, historically speaking, could be a good Republican year, with the party out of power of the White House traditionally gaining seats in midterms of a new administration. They\u2019re still waiting on challengers to Kelly and Warnock. At the very least, they\u2019re giving two Democratic incumbents a head start on fundraising, which is also a factor in places like New Hampshire and Nevada, where big-name candidates eyeing the race haven\u2019t yet gotten in and are freezing the fields. Democrats, meanwhile, are excited about two Black women candidates (or almost candidates) in two states they\u2019re trying to flip that fall a bit lower down the list. Cheri Beasley, the former North Carolina Supreme Court chief justice, announced her candidacy for Senate last month, while Rep. Val Demings is planning a bid in Florida. Since Harris resigned from her seat to become vice president, there are no Black women in the Senate. Across all these races, there\u2019s still time for new candidates to jump in and presumed candidates to back out, which is why these rankings will be updated many times over the next 18 months. Here is CNN\u2019s third ranking of the 10 seats most likely to flip in 2022: Incumbent: Republican Pat Toomey (retiring) Pennsylvania remains the seat most likely to flip with Republicans trying to defend an open seat in a state that Biden won last fall. The primary fields on both sides are still in flux, with Republicans recently picking up a new candidate in Army veteran Sean Parnell, who ran for Congress last year but came up short against Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who himself could launch a Sente bid. Even in a state that went for Biden, Trump loyalty is a salient factor in the GOP primary. Donald Trump Jr. quickly backed Parnell, while Jeff Bartos, who was already in the race, dredged up Parnell\u2019s old tweets from the 2016 presidential primary. Having run with the GOP President\u2019s backing in 2020, Parnell may occupy a Trumpier lane than Bartos, a wealthy businessman who loaned his campaign $400,000 during the first quarter, but Bartos carefully namedrops the former President in his announcement video. The Democratic field is crowded with Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh and a handful of other state and federal elected officials still looking at the race. Republicans like their odds against Fetterman, the progressive former mayor of Braddock \u2013 and the biggest fundraiser so far. But the list of candidates trying to replace Toomey may keep growing, so expect plenty of drama in this top-tier race before we even get to the general election. Incumbent: Democrat Raphael Warnock Warnock, who flipped this seat blue in a January runoff, is in the enviable position of raising money for his quest to win a full six-year term while waiting for a Republican challenger. He started the second quarter with $5.6 million in the bank. As CNN has previously reported, former NFL running back Herschel Walker \u2013 who doesn\u2019t even live in Georgia \u2013 has frozen the GOP field because he has Trump\u2019s backing. Other potential Republican candidates, knowing how important Trump\u2019s support would be in a GOP primary, don\u2019t want to run until they see whether Walker, a political novice, actually dives in. Rep. Buddy Carter, who has spoken to Walker, recently told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that the Texas resident won\u2019t decide what he\u2019ll do until the beginning of the summer. Carter himself is waiting on Walker, saying he\u2019ll run if the Heisman Trophy winner doesn\u2019t. Plenty of others could still jump in the race, too. State House Speaker David Ralston\u2019s recent tweet about meeting with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Sen. Rick Scott, the chairman of the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign committee, sparked chatter about his interest in the race, while former Sen. Kelly Loeffler, Warnock\u2019s opponent in the January runoff, and Rep. Drew Ferguson may still be contenders. Meanwhile, former Rep. Doug Collins, who failed to make it to the 2021 runoff, announced in April that he would not run. But the hold up on the GOP side doesn\u2019t mean Warnock is in for an easy race. And it remains to be seen how Georgia\u2019s new restrictive voting law, which voting rights advocates say makes it harder for Black Georgians to vote, will impact Democrats\u2019 winning coalition here. Republicans are excited that Warnock now has a voting record and won\u2019t be running in the unique circumstances of a special election runoff, and they\u2019re looking forward to weaponizing the business boycott of the state against Democrats, even though it was a GOP law that sparked the All Star Game and others to move. Incumbent: Republican Ron Johnson Johnson continues to be the biggest variable in this race: Will he run again? The two-term senator hasn\u2019t said, but he\u2019s generating plenty of other headlines, spewing misinformation about vaccines and conspiracy theories about the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. His antics are raising questions about whether it\u2019d be easier for Republicans to hold this seat \u2013 in a state Biden narrowly won \u2013 without him on the ballot. His indecision is making it hard for any other Republicans who might be interested in the race \u2013 there\u2019s talk about Rep. Mike Gallagher, for example \u2013 to make a move. Meanwhile, Democrats have a crowded field with Outagamie County Executive Tom Nelson, Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry, state Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and state Sen. Chris Larson, who announced Wednesday \u2013 and that could still grow if Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes gets in the race. Democrats feel good about their options here and like the idea of running against Johnson, whom they see as a damaged incumbent, just as much as they do about it being an open seat. Incumbent: Republican Richard Burr (retiring) Republicans aren\u2019t as worried about defending North Carolina as they are Biden states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, but the open seat created by Burr\u2019s retirement is giving Democrats an opening \u2013 potentially with more diverse candidates who could help them drive minority turnout. Cheri Beasley, the former state Supreme Court chief justice who narrowly lost reelection in 2020, announced her candidacy at the end of April and quickly secured the backing of EMILY\u2019s List, a powerful player in Democratic primaries. The pro-abortion rights group touted Beasley\u2019s 2008 experience as the first Black woman to win statewide in North Carolina. State Sen. Jeff Jackson and former state Sen. Erica Smith, whom Republicans tried to boost in the 2020 primary, were already running. Republicans got a new candidate, too: Rep. Ted Budd also launched his campaign at the end of April with a monster truck-studded announcement video that played footage of Trump praising him during the 2020 campaign. The conservative Club for Growth PAC threw its support behind the three-term congressman, who\u2019s facing former Rep. Mark Walker \u2013 who\u2019s been in the race since last year \u2013 and former Gov. Pat McCrory. Incumbent: Democrat Mark Kelly Kelly is running for a full six-term after winning the seat of the late Sen. John McCain last fall. Kelly only won by about 2 points last year, and Biden carried the state by an even narrower margin. Plus, the former astronaut now has a voting record. All of that should make this a competitive race. But Republicans have had trouble landing a candidate, and more than anywhere else, their lack of a big name here is concerning to some Republicans, in part because this should be a hotly contested race \u2013 one that the GOP needs to win if the party is going to have a realistic shot at the majority. Solar energy entrepreneur Jim Lamon became the first Republican to enter the race earlier this month. Others could still enter the race, like Rep. Andy Biggs, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Blake Masters, the president of the Thiel Foundation, Maj. Gen. Michael McGuire and state Attorney General Mark Brnovich, whom Trump criticized this week for not fully embracing the GOP-ordered audit in Maricopa County. But other statewide races seem to be attracting Republicans who aren\u2019t eager to face the impressive Democratic fundraiser (Kelly raised $4.4 million in the first quarter), who\u2019s known for his compelling personal story as the husband of Gabby Giffords, the former congresswoman who was shot and wounded in a mass shooting and has since become a vocal gun violence prevention advocate. Still, Republicans hope that whoever runs, this will be a policy rather than personality-driven race, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee launching digital ads attacking the Democrat on immigration earlier this month. But Kelly hasn\u2019t shied away from the issue, criticizing Biden\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress for not spending more time on the border crisis. Incumbent: Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto Republicans are also waiting for a candidate to take on Cortez Masto, a first-term senator. All eyes remain on former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt, who, as a former statewide elected official, Republicans hope would give them a good shot. Democrats will be eager to tie him to Trump and his efforts to overturn the election. But Biden only won the Silver State by about 2 points last fall, as did Cortez Masto in her first Senate race in 2016. Two years later, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen carried the state by 5 points. So even though Nevada has been a blue state recently, both sides still view it as competitive. Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator, is fresh off a term as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raising $2.3 million in the first quarter and starting the second quarter with nearly $4.7 million in the bank. Incumbent: Democrat Maggie Hassan The GOP anticipation is similar in the Granite State, where Republicans are eager for Gov. Chris Sununu to run against first-term Sen. Hassan, believing he\u2019d give the Democratic former governor a real race. But Sununu has said he won\u2019t make a move until the end of the legislative session, which is next month, so until he decides what to do, the Republican field is in a holding pattern. For sure, Sununu\u2019s name and credibility as a statewide elected official would likely bump it up on this list of seats most likely to flip. But Democrats argue that at the federal level at least, New Hampshire has trended much more blue, even over the past four years. While Hassan and Clinton both won by less than half a point in 2016, Biden carried the state by 7 points and Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen won reelection by nearly 16 points last fall. Incumbent: Republican Rob Portman (retiring) While an ever-growing field of Republicans dukes it out to replace Portman, the question in Ohio is whether Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan will be able to recreate Sen. Sherrod Brown\u2019s magic. The three-term senator is the rare Democrat to recently win statewide in the Buckeye State, which has been trending more red. Ryan, who\u2019s represented the Youngstown area since 2003 and briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination last cycle, officially got into the race at the end of April, trying to appeal to blue collar voters who may have been swayed by Trump. \u201cMy experience has been just focusing on the workers, their families, the issues that are important to them,\u201d Ryan told CNN at the time. With other prominent Democrats passing on the race, the congressman is the big name. But Republicans are excited about running against a 10-term lawmaker with a voting record in a state that\u2019s been moving their way. First, though, they\u2019ve got their own internal dynamics to sort out, with former state Treasurer Josh Mandel, former state party chair Jane Timken and several wealthy businessmen running. \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d author J.D. Vance has formed an exploratory committee, and while it\u2019s not clear how much his Silicon Valley connections would endear him to Ohio voters, the $10 million super PAC commitment from Peter Thiel certainly wouldn\u2019t hurt. While Democrats are gleeful to see Republican infighting here (mostly over loyalty to Trump), Republicans feel pretty comfortable that any of their candidates would be good enough in a state that voted for Trump by 8 points last fall. Incumbent: Republican Marco Rubio By the numbers, Florida is a more competitive state than Ohio, but given that Ohio is an open seat with an already messy Republican primary, Florida remains at No. 9 for now, although that could change soon. Democratic Rep. Val Demings has shaken up this race with the news \u2013 confirmed by sources familiar \u2013 that she\u2019s planning to run for Senate against Republican Sen. Marco Rubio. Demings, who was a vice presidential contender for Biden, hadn\u2019t made secret her aspirations for higher office, but it was long thought she was more seriously eyeing the gubernatorial race. First elected to Congress in 2016, she gained prominence as an impeachment manager during Trump\u2019s first trial and she brings an interesting background as a former social worker and Orlando police chief. Another Orlando-area congresswoman, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, announced Monday she would not run for Senate in 2022, sparing Democrats a potentially expensive and damaging primary. Even if Republicans ultimately feel good about Rubio\u2019s chances in a state Trump won by 3 points, they\u2019re watching to see how much investment it will take from them and how much that spending in a very expensive state impacts their capabilities across the map. Incumbent: Republican Roy Blunt (retiring) Blunt\u2019s decision not to run for reelection should not, on its own, have caused much of a headache for Republicans looking to hold onto this red state. But the candidacy of former Gov. Eric Greitens, who resigned from office following a probe into allegations of sexual and campaign misconduct, could give Democrats just enough of an opening that this race is on the list for the second month in a row now. Greitens\u2019 candidacy \u2013 and his connections to Trump world \u2013 are concerning to Republicans, who worry that much like Todd Akin in 2012, he could endanger this seat if he\u2019s the nominee and force other GOP candidates around the country to answer for him. That may be one reason why state Senate Republicans tried to create a runoff rule that would apply for next year. Attorney General Eric Schmitt is in the race and members of the congressional delegation could still join too, but the fear has been that having more candidates could split the anti-Greitens vote in a primary. But national Republicans may have actually gotten some good news with the campaign announcement of Mark McCloskey, who could appeal to similar voters as Greitens, potentially splitting the former governor\u2019s base. McCloskey and his wife appeared in videos last summer pointing guns at demonstrators outside their St. Louis mansion. While much of the country watched in horror, the GOP embraced the couple, giving them a speaking slot at last year\u2019s Republican National Convention.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are bracing for a deluge of disinformation in next year\u2019s midterm elections, and they view leading Republicans, not foreign actors or armies of online trolls, as the biggest disinformation threat. After the 2016 election, there were concerns about how Russia, a foreign actor, had used platforms like Facebook and Twitter to set up thousands of accounts in order to pose as Americans to interfere with the election. But the 2020 election put a new spotlight on domestic efforts to misinform people \u2013 something that was brought into focus by the election lies that led to the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6. To combat the issue, a team at the Democratic National Committee that has spent the past few years tracking online disinformation networks is adjusting to the evolving landscape of lies online, party officials tell CNN. Democrats believe the disinformation perpetuated by Republicans and right-wing outlets played a key role in some 2020 races, particularly in areas like South Florida and South Texas, two places that experienced significant swings toward former President Donald Trump. Groups like Media Matters, a left-leaning media watchdog, and Voto Latino, a group focused on registering Latino voters, have partnered to create The Latino Anti-Disinformation Lab, an effort that will both study and combat the issue. \u201cThe goal broadly is to fill a gap that exists in communications and monitoring infrastructure right now,\u201d said Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters. \u201cIt has been really hard to get people to think what matters in a private WhatsApp community is really relevant.\u201d For some Democrats, like former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, the issue is personal. Mucarsel-Powell, after winning her House seat in 2018, lost her reelection bid just two years later. While the Democrat said she knows multiple factors added up to her loss, she believes misinformation among Latino voters was a \u201cpretty significant reason as to why\u201d she failed to win reelection. She is now committed to helping the party understand how outlandish conspiracy theories from corners of the internet led to popular WhatsApp text chains and influential Spanish-language radio in her Florida district. \u201cIt was everywhere,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell said of misinformation ahead of the 2020 election. \u201cAnd for Democrats, it was tough to fight a war that they did not see.\u201d The battle against misinformation is not a new effort for Democrats, but it has changed since more concerted efforts were launched after the 2016 election. Blindsided by Russian trolls in 2016, social media companies and the US government invested in finding and shutting down covert social media campaigns targeting the US from places like Russia and Iran. The DNC team, set up after the 2016 election, used online monitoring tools to identify networks of often-anonymous accounts pushing coordinated disinformation campaigns and then flagged these accounts to the social media platforms, which would sometimes remove them if the accounts broke its rules. \u201cIt\u2019s concerning that we\u2019re able to uncover these terms-of-service-violating operations on a fairly regular basis, with a team far smaller than Facebook\u2019s,\u201d wrote Seema Nanda, the then-DNC CEO, in a letter to Facebook in 2019. But over the four years of the Trump administration, disinformation evolved and was mainlined by political leaders like Trump himself and other top Republicans. The ongoing perpetuation of the falsehood that the election was stolen from Trump and the resulting insurrection at the US Capitol earlier this year further highlighted that the United States has a major domestic disinformation problem. Timothy Durigan, the DNC\u2019s top analyst on disinformation, says his team will now focus more on how major Republicans are embracing and feeding into online misinformation and will work with the committee\u2019s communications team on ways to counter it. Durigan told CNN that platforms like Facebook had made progress in identifying large-scale bot and troll networks but continued to allow Republicans to push damaging lies about the election. \u201cFacebook is biased towards lies. The way the algorithms work, they reward engagement, they don\u2019t reward accuracy,\u201d Durigan said. \u201cLies do better on social media, so that is a big challenge, and not just social media, there\u2019s a talk radio ecosystem, there\u2019s Fox, OAN, Newsmax. There\u2019s all of these media outlets that kind of traffic in conspiracy theories, mis- and disinformation and in general propaganda that have huge reach.\u201d Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs, recently wrote, \u201cFacebook\u2019s systems are not designed to reward provocative content. In fact, key parts of those systems are designed to do just the opposite.\u201d Clegg pointed out that Facebook down-ranks some content, including content that is found to be false by Facebook\u2019s fact-checkers. As contentious a relationship DNC officials like Durigan might have with platforms like Facebook, they at least have someone to speak to at the Silicon Valley giant and the platform has at least some rules and policies it seeks to maintain. The challenge for Durigan and other Democrats, however, is the rise of popular platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram and Parler, which have fewer rules against disinformation and where lies are primarily spread on private channels. For Jose Parra, who was a top aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and now focuses on Florida politics, the use of WhatsApp chains to spread misinformation was possibly the most determinative explanation for Trump\u2019s growth with some Latino voters in South Florida. \u201cIt was just an unrelenting stream of falsehoods on Biden and the Democrats wanting to turn the United States into another Cuba or Venezuela,\u201d Parra said. \u201cIt was the South Florida version of the big lie.\u201d Parra said that for many immigrant communities, especially those that came from countries with repressive governments, platforms with private communication channels like WhatsApp are markedly popular. This created a problem for Democrats: When misinformation began to spread on these closed networks, it was difficult to monitor and even harder to combat. \u201cA lot of this stuff was flying under the radar,\u201d he said, \u201cand it hit us like a train.\u201d Carl Woog, a spokesman for WhatsApp, said the platform has taken steps to combat misinformation. WhatsApp brought in new rules, including limiting the number of forwards for a message, marking forwarded messages so recipients know the person sending it likely didn\u2019t write it, working with fact-checking organizations to help monitor what false information is spreading and banning mass messaging and mass calling on the platform. \u201cThis is important,\u201d said Woog, a former political communicator who worked for Barack Obama\u2019s campaign in 2008 and went on to work for the then-President\u2019s Department of Defense. \u201cWe want to help participate in making communities more resilient to misinformation and for people to get more information on the content they are seeing.\u201d The omnipresence of misinformation in South Florida shocked Mucarsel-Powell in 2020 as she fought to keep her congressional seat. She saw it coming \u2013 she penned a letter in September that called for the FBI to investigate disinformation aimed at Latinos \u2013 but the ubiquity of it is what hit her in the months leading up to the election. Mucarsel-Powell said the disinformation was everywhere Latino voters get their news: on the radio, as inserts in Spanish-language papers like El Nuevo Herald and in closed WhatsApp message chains. \u201cPeople get their news from these radio stations, they have social contact through these WhatsApp chat rooms and they read the Nuevo Herald,\u201d Mucarsel-Powell said. \u201cSo after a few months of this, they believed what they were reading and hearing.\u201d Mucarsel-Powell says national Democrats were largely blind to the issue and that urgent calls from Florida Democrats went mostly unanswered. She recalled that she had been shown a WhatsApp message that had spread attacking her and the Democratic Party on abortion and that just days later, people had parroted those same attacks to her when she was campaigning. For the former congresswoman, combating such disinformation has become an intense focus. She is still waiting for the FBI to respond to her request, and would like the House and Senate to investigate the issue. As for her party, Mucarsel-Powell said the issue requires an \u201call-hands approach.\u201d \u201cToo often we see national Democratic organizations like the DNC be out of touch with the conversations that are going on in these communities,\u201d she said. \u201cThe first thing they need to do is speak directly to the people affected by this misinformation.\u201d That is where groups like Media Matters and others come in. The Latino Anti-Disinformation Lab plans to test the best ways to combat disinformation on platforms like WhatsApp, getting data on how and whether targeted ad campaigns work and how effective appealing to the platform can be. One of the biggest early takeaways is that Democrats can\u2019t be afraid to take on messy narratives that are spreading in tight communities. \u201cYou are going to have to get into these communities and actually have people there that are talking in a way that is, at a minimum, putting up a counter-position,\u201d said Carusone, noting that false story lines about Biden and socialism and the connections that son Hunter Biden had to China had spread like wildfire on WhatsApp channels. Carusone added that the biggest issue with combating closed communication chains is that none of the communications are public, meaning they can\u2019t be regulated like content on Facebook or Twitter. And because it is so unknown, fighting it will require a lot of failure. \u201cIn order to fight this stuff, you have to spend money, which means you have to raise money, which means you have to have a strategy to sell to donors, which means you are putting yourself on the line,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what if you don\u2019t know?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Twenty-nine years ago, less than a year after he had taken the bench, Justice Clarence Thomas joined a dissent calling the landmark opinion Roe v. Wade \u201cplainly wrong\u201d and an \u201cerroneous constitutional decision.\u201d Over the years Thomas would say Roe had \u201cno basis in the Constitution\u201d and call out the court\u2019s abortion precedents as \u201cgrievously wrong.\u201d He also took aim at challenges to the Second Amendment, accusing lower courts and his own colleagues of thumbing their noses at the right to bear arms, calling it a \u201cdisfavored right.\u201d Now Thomas is 72 years old with a head of gray hair and he is awaiting a new season on a 6-3 conservative majority court. The justices have agreed to hear a case next term that critics \u2013 and some supporters \u2013 say is meant to gut Roe. They will also hear a Second Amendment case that could expand gun rights. And Thomas, the longest-serving member of the court, will likely find himself in the majority. How Trump and McConnell set the final pieces for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade All along, Thomas has been cultivating his jurisprudence, often in dissent. Now, he\u2019s lasted long enough to potentially see a shift not only in the areas of abortion and the Second Amendment but also in other key areas, including affirmative action and voting rights. Thomas has also witnessed Chief Justice John Roberts, ever the incrementalist and the institutionalist, press the brake at times to slow the momentum of the far right side of the bench. Now that Justice Amy Coney Barrett is on the court, Roberts\u2019 role will be diminished. That was already evident this spring in an emergency order when a 5-4 conservative majority moved the needle to the right in a religious liberty case. Roberts was in dissent. RELATED: How Amy Coney Barrett has changed the Supreme Court in ways Kavanaugh hasn\u2019t More than any other member of the current court, Thomas is deeply skeptical of the notion of \u201cstare decisis\u201d\u2013 a legal term that is roughly translated to mean \u201cstand by the thing decided and not disturb the calm.\u201d It reflects the court\u2019s respect for the accumulated opinions that have been handed down in history as well as the consistent development of legal principles. Democrats wary of appearing to push Justice Breyer out despite their small window to replace him Last term he noted, for example, that the court has \u201crecently overruled a number of poorly reasoned precedents that have proved themselves to be unworkable.\u201d This June, court watchers are on high alert to see if liberal Justice Stephen Breyer retires to clear the path for President Joe Biden to name his first nominee. If Biden does get the chance, he\u2019s probably going to look for someone young enough to spend decades on the bench to influence the law. Thomas, who was just 43 when he was nominated, could, in that respect, serve as a model. It was just last June that Roberts joined with the liberals to strike down a Louisiana abortion law, stunning conservatives. Thomas lashed out. \u201cRoe is grievously wrong for many reasons,\u201d Thomas wrote, \u201cbut the most fundamental is that its core holding\u2014that the Constitution protects a woman\u2019s right to abort her unborn child\u2014finds no support in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Thomas previously warned in 2019 of the potential that abortion could become a \u201ctool of eugenic manipulation.\u201d But this week the justices agreed to hear a case next term concerning a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks. Barrett\u2019s vote may have been critical. Supporters of abortion rights rang alarm bells. RBG's death casts a shadow over Breyer's upcoming decision as court takes a right turn \u201cThe Supreme Court just agreed to review an abortion ban that unquestionably violates nearly 50 years of Supreme Court precedent and is a test case to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d Nancy Northup, the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement. But conservatives rejoiced. \u201cThis is a landmark opportunity for the Supreme Court to recognize the right of states to protect unborn children from the horrors of painful late-term abortions,\u201d said Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of the Susan B. Anthony List. RELATED: More states are expected to pass anti-abortion bills challenging Roe v. Wade ahead of monumental Supreme Court case The court does not need to formally overturn Roe in order to make a difference. But if it did take that step, abortion access would be left to the individual states. According to the abortion rights research group the Guttmacher Institute, 22 states have laws that could be used to restrict the legal status of abortion. In 2008, Thomas signed on to Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s landmark opinion holding that the Second Amendment protects the individual right to have firearms for self-defense.  Supporters of gun rights believed that many gun regulations across the country would fall. But lower courts, citing a part of the District of Columbia v. Heller decision that said that the \u201cright secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited,\u201d allowed for some regulations. In 2017 Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, dissented when the court declined to take up a case that might expand upon Heller. \u201cI find it extremely improbable that the Framers understood the Second Amendment to protect little more than carrying a gun from the bedroom to the kitchen,\u201d he wrote. Thomas criticized what he called a \u201cdistressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right.\u201d The Supreme Court's key Second Amendment opinion and what might come next He noted at the time that the court had not heard argument in a Second Amendment case for seven years. \u201cSince that time, we have heard argument in, for example, roughly 35 cases where the question presented turned on the meaning of the First Amendment and 25 cases that turned on the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. \u201d Last term, the court again passed over several Second Amendment cases, but on April 26, the justices \u2013 presumably because the conservatives thought they had five solid votes with the addition of Barrett \u2013 agreed to hear a case next term concerning a New York law that restricts an individual from carrying a concealed handgun in public. \u201cFew people realize how often Justice Thomas\u2019 solo opinions eventually become majority opinions in the Supreme Court,\u201d said David Kopel, a Second Amendment expert and professor at the University of Denver Law School. \u201cFor example, in the 1997 case Printz v. United States, Justice Thomas wrote a concurring opinion saying that some gun control laws might violate the Second Amendment , expressing his hope that the court would one day take a Second Amendment case.\u201d Kopel noted that the court did just that eventually in Heller. There is also a good chance that the court revisits affirmative action in the near future. A group called Students for Fair Admissions, for example, is asking the court to hear a case over Harvard\u2019s admissions policy (the school has won at the lower courts). The group is urging the Supreme Court to overturn precedent that has long allowed consideration of race in admissions, specifically a 2003 case called Grutter v. Bollinger. Judges are split on how seriously to take John Roberts' abortion opinion In 2013, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion in one case saying he thought that Grutter should be overruled and the court should hold that a \u201cstate\u2019s use of race in higher education admission decisions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that the lawyer challenging the Harvard case, William Consovoy, is a former Thomas clerk. Indeed, Thomas\u2019 influence expands beyond his written word. Former clerks such as former acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall and Patrick Philbin, who served as deputy counsel to the president, had key positions in the Trump administration. And Trump appointed former clerks as judges on powerful appellate courts, including Gregory Katsas, James Ho and Neomi Rao. Thomas has also frequently written alone, provocatively planting more seeds for his colleagues to ponder. In 2019 he called for the reconsideration of a landmark First Amendment case, New York Times v. Sullivan, calling it a policy-driven decision \u201cmasquerading as constitutional law.\u201d Earlier this year, he suggested that Congress consider whether laws should be updated to better regulate social media platforms that he said have come to have \u201cunbridled control\u201d over speech. Justice Clarence Thomas suggests US should regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter In the voting rights context, Thomas dissented after the election when the court denied an appeal from Republicans challenging a Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision that allowed ballots received up to three days after Election Day to be counted to accommodate challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cBecause the Federal Constitution, not state constitutions, gives state legislatures authority to regulate federal elections, petitioners presented a strong argument that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision violated the Constitution by overriding the clearly expressed intent of the legislature,\u201d Thomas wrote. Election law experts say that if a majority ultimately adopts that position it could have a fundamental impact on the power of state courts to have final word on their states\u2019 voting rules. Thomas noted that it was \u201cfortunate\u201d that the decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \u201cdoes not appear to have changed the outcome in any federal election\u201d but said that \u201cwe may not be so lucky in the future.\u201d In doing so, he seemed to give at least some credence to supporters of former President Donald Trump who believe that voter fraud is widespread even though most experts say it is not. \u201cFor one thing,\u201d Thomas wrote, \u201cas election administrators have long agreed, the risk of fraud is vastly more prevalent for mail-in ballots.\u201d Thomas\u2019 allies have long waited for the current moment. \u201cSince he joined the Supreme Court, Justice Thomas has voted to decide cases based on what the law and facts require,\u201d said Tyler Green, a former clerk who currently works for the law firm Consovoy McCarthy. \u201cThat makes it all the more satisfying now to see his opinions becoming popular \u2013 and shaping entire areas of Supreme Court precedent \u2013 precisely because they are right.\u201d",

            "article_content": "For more than 20 years, Justice Stephen Breyer has authored the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions endorsing abortion rights. With Monday\u2019s news that the court will hear a case that could gut Roe v. Wade next session, a new question has emerged: Will a desire to influence the outcome affect the 82-year-old justice\u2019s decision on whether to retire this summer? Monday\u2019s action casts in stark relief the dilemma of retirement timing and the consequences of the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s decision to remain on the bench through her 80s. The court\u2019s announcement that it would revisit decades-old precedent on reproductive rights likely occurred only because of the presence of her conservative successor, Justice Amy Coney Barrett. The high court had rejected appeals such as Mississippi\u2019s in the past and lower courts were consistently ruling against bans on abortion before a fetus is viable, that is, can live outside the womb. The Ginsburg effect cannot help but be entangled with the choice facing Breyer. And the abortion-rights dilemma adds to the many elements that could steer his timing. For any justice, the decision typically involves a nuanced consideration of personal factors, institutional concerns and political realities. And those can often be in conflict, as has been brought home for Democrats with Ginsburg\u2019s situation. She died last September at age 87 just weeks before the presidential election and Donald Trump\u2019s defeat. She had wanted to outlive his presidency and reportedly made a deathbed request that the next president appoint her successor. But Ginsburg had also spurned the calls of fellow liberals to retire when President Barack Obama was in office and the Senate in Democratic hands. \u201cAt some point I will get over Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s failure to retire. Today is not that day,\u201d Harvard Kennedy School Professor Maya Sen wrote on Twitter after the court said it would take the momentous abortion controversy. Hers was just one of the more pointed laments on social media Monday regarding the Ginsburg-to-Barrett succession. Democrats wary of appearing to push Justice Breyer out despite their small window to replace him Breyer has likely heard that drumbeat. And he knows that important cases will continue to reach the court, no matter which nine individuals sit there. At some point, realities related to personal health or even Senate politics intrude on individual interests. Ginsburg spoke openly about defying the political pressure and continuing to contribute to the law in America. She also appreciated the attention that grew with her \u201cNotorious RBG\u201d status. That moniker and meme began in public admiration of a dissenting opinion she wrote as the majority rolled back the 1965 Voting Rights Act in 2013. It was around that time that liberals began publicly urging her to retire while both the White House and Senate were in Democratic hands. Obama invited her to lunch that year. Ginsburg resisted overt and subtle overtures. In 2014, she responded to a question I asked about liberal pressure with a rhetorical question of her own: \u201cSo tell me who the President could have nominated this spring that you would rather see on the court than me?\u201d 20 years of closed-door conversations with Ruth Bader Ginsburg In 2016, she expected Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to win the November election and that she would be able to retire in upcoming years. Trump\u2019s surprising victory ended that plan, although her health did nearly hold out through his four-year term. In her final days of battling cancer, Ginsburg said, according to an account her granddaughter, a lawyer, provided to NPR: \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d Many on the left have cited the Ginsburg situation as they publicly urge Breyer to retire, to guarantee that Democratic President Joe Biden can appoint a younger liberal while the Senate is in Democratic hands, by a single vote. RELATED: Most Americans want to see the Supreme Court uphold Roe v. Wade, polling shows Breyer, a former Senate Judiciary Committee staffer, has remained wise to the ways of the Senate and he knows the advantages of a Democratic majority to Biden. He also would be aware that, barring the illness or death of a crucial Democratic senator, that majority should hold until the 2022 elections. Such dire possibilities rattle advocates on the left, who say Breyer should retire this year rather than next. Breyer has declined to respond to questions about his retirement desires or the pressure, which included a mobile billboard truck circling Capitol Hill earlier this spring and calling on Breyer to step down, sponsored by Demand Justice, a liberal group. How Trump and McConnell set the final pieces for the Supreme Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade Breyer, a former law professor, is known for trying to sidestep friction and, among the nine, trying to build consensus. In an April Harvard lecture, he asserted that the justices were not as politically motivated or divided as they appear. The bench is now split between six Republican-appointed conservatives and three Democratic-appointed liberals. Yet the liberalism of Breyer, a 1994 appointee of President Bill Clinton, has more and more left him to dissent on the increasingly Republican-dominated conservative court. Abortion rights could offer another instance. Once in the majority, Breyer\u2019s robust view of reproductive rights has lost support. The high court\u2019s abortion precedents could fully disappear with action next year on the Mississippi law that bans abortions at 15 weeks, more than a month before viability. In a 2000 Nebraska case that marked the start of Breyer\u2019s series backing abortion rights, he revealed his effort to balance competing interests: \u201cMillions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; \u2026 Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity \u2026 leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.\u201d Most Americans want to see the Supreme Court uphold Roe v. Wade, polling shows As he acknowledged those differences and worked across the ideological divide, Breyer was able to keep a majority of five justices together to strike down state laws that restricted women\u2019s access to abortion. But the retirement of former ally Justice Anthony Kennedy (succeeded by Brett Kavanaugh), as well as the death of women\u2019s rights beacon Ginsburg, has made this a whole new court on abortion rights. As Breyer balances his own personal timing for retirement and considers his influence on cases, this may be one area of the law he will count as lost.",

            "article_content": "Conservatives have been waiting decades for this moment: a transformed Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear an abortion case that directly challenges women\u2019s reproductive rights tracing to the 1973 Roe v. Wade milestone. And unlike past times when Roe teetered in the balance, this is not a 5-4 court with the potential to suddenly dash the hopes of Republicans and religious conservatives. This is a 6-3 conservative-liberal bench. If one of the GOP appointees suddenly edges left, as happened before, a five-justice right-wing majority would still exist. Republicans rued the abortion-rights votes of GOP-nominated Justices Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, David Souter and Anthony Kennedy, all now retired, over the years. The art of persuasion: How past presidents have tried to nudge Supreme Court justices off the bench But the current makeup of the court, with three appointees of former President Donald Trump and three other justices who have opposed abortion rights, provides a dynamic that found abortion opponents ecstatic at the court\u2019s announcement and abortion rights supporters trembling. Abortion has been the single most consistent and contentious subject of Supreme Court confirmations since the early 1980s, when Republican President Ronald Reagan made reversal of the 1973 Roe milestone a mission. Abortion politics have influenced the presidential screening of nominees, senators\u2019 votes and the increasing force of special interest groups in the confirmation orbit. RELATED: Democrats wary of appearing to push Justice Breyer out despite their small window to replace him Republican lawmakers especially have fought to make this moment possible, in statehouses across the country and in the US Senate. Then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ensured that the conservative stalwart Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, would not be succeeded by a liberal. And McConnell then sped through the nomination of Amy Coney Barrett to replace liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg days before last fall\u2019s presidential election. For decades at nomination hearings, senators and nominees have fallen into a cat-and-mouse routine, as senators on the dais ask questions directed at where an individual truly stood on Roe and nominees avoid revealing anything, particularly at the risk of imperiling the chance of appointment. All subtly evaporated last fall when then-Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said of Barrett, \u201cThis is the first time in American history that we\u2019ve nominated a woman who\u2019s unashamedly pro-life and embraces her faith without apology.\u201d Barrett declined to \u201cpre-commit\u201d on the subject of abortion. A devout Roman Catholic, she was the third appointee of Trump, who vowed to choose justices who would reverse Roe and return the issue to the states. Barrett strengthened rightward pull on the bench. She also sealed the confidence conservatives expressed, and the dismay from liberals, that a new anti-abortion era was underway. How Amy Coney Barrett has changed the Supreme Court in ways Kavanaugh hasn't After months of internal debate on the matter, the justices announced on Monday they would add to their 2021-22 session a dispute over a Mississippi ban on abortions after 15 weeks. The controversy, which would likely be heard in the fall and decided by June of 2022, could eviscerate the heart of Roe v. Wade, which declared women have a constitutional right to end a pregnancy. That landmark and a 1992 case, Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, effectively prevented bans on pre-viability abortions, that is, before the fetus would be able to live outside the womb. The court placed viability at 23-24 weeks in the 1992 case. The dispute, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, marks the start of the most momentous abortion battle since 1992. The lower US appellate court that rejected the Mississippi law had written, \u201cIn an unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court\u2019s abortion cases have established (and affirmed, and re-affirmed) a woman\u2019s right to choose an abortion before viability. States may regulate abortion procedures prior to viability so long as they do not impose an undue burden on the woman\u2019s right, but they may not ban abortions. The law at issue is a ban.\u201d The Supreme Court's conservatives may have the votes to expand Second Amendment rights For nearly 30 years, the justices spurned appeals that would have meant such a deep reconsideration of precedent. The court worked around the edges, in recent cases reviewing regulations on clinics and physicians, issues that affected women\u2019s access to abortion but not the core right or viability line. Newer justices increasingly complained about the pattern. Trump\u2019s first appointee, Neil Gorsuch, wrote last year that in a \u201chighly politicized and contentious arena \u2026 we have lost our way.\u201d But conservatives who voiced an interest in reversing prior decisions on abortion were no doubt unsure whether they would have at least five votes for a major decision. The addition of Barrett plainly changed the calculus, and at a time when more states have passed bans such as Mississippi\u2019s. Earlier this spring Arkansas adopted a near-total abortion prohibition with no exception for cases of rape or incest. With Barrett and Gorsuch, Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh. The other GOP justices who have voted against abortion rights are Clarence Thomas, now in his 30th year and most vigilant in urging reversal of Roe; Samuel Alito, who succeeded centrist-conservative O\u2019Connor in 2006, causing an ideological shift on many dilemmas including abortion; and Chief Justice John Roberts, named in 2005 as a successor to Chief Justice William Rehnquist. Until last year, Roberts had consistently backed abortion regulations. But in a Louisiana dispute, he provided the fifth vote (with the four liberals at the time) to invalidate a regulation similar to a Texas restriction the court had struck down in 2016. Roberts wrote that although he disagreed with the prior ruling, he felt bound by it. At the same time, however, Roberts separated himself from the justices on the left by asserting a legal standard that would enhance government leeway to impose restrictions on abortion, for example, through clinic standards or physician credentialing. As chief justice on a deeply split court in a turbulent era of American politics, Roberts has hedged his own ideological views, seemingly to steady the court and inspire public confidence. Judges are split on how seriously to take John Roberts' abortion opinion That tendency, along with his dramatic 2012 vote (again with the liberals) to uphold the Affordable Care Act, has provoked criticism from the right wing and some suspicion of how he would ultimately vote on the future of Roe v. Wade. But conservatives seeking curtailment of abortion rights may not need his vote. With the addition of Barrett, Roberts is no longer at the ideological center of the bench and no longer has the swing-vote power. And now that the court has decided to reexamine abortion rights, the only question is how far the majority will go to roll back the nearly half-century-old declaration that the constitutional right to privacy covers the decision to end a pregnancy.",

            "article_content": "Senior Democrats are treading carefully around Justice Stephen Breyer these days, worried that a progressive push to get him to retire could either anger him or come off as overtly political \u2013 in either case potentially dashing their hopes of getting a young new liberal on the Supreme Court in his place. The clock is ticking for the party, because the Senate could fall into Republican hands during the midterm elections next year \u2013 or, actually, at any moment. Two members of the Democratic majority are near or just over 80 years old, and they hail from a state where a Republican governor would name their replacement if they weren\u2019t able to serve. RELATED: How Amy Coney Barrett has changed the Supreme Court in ways Kavanaugh hasn\u2019t But Breyer \u2013 at age 82 the senior liberal on the Supreme Court \u2013 is keen on keeping the high court free of political influence. And at a moment when a Democratic president gets to nominate any new justice, and Democrats hold the Senate\u2019s tie-breaking vote on confirmation, an open campaign to squeeze him out could have the opposite of the intended effect. The art of persuasion: How past presidents have tried to nudge Supreme Court justices off the bench So while many congressional Democrats admit the ticking clock is on their minds, multiple sources tell CNN, they\u2019re almost all keeping a studiously respectful distance. In conversations with CNN, White House officials hew to their public message that there is no open seat on the bench and they\u2019re staying out of the matter until there is. Behind the scenes, though, there are preparations for one of the most significant tasks that could fall to President Joe Biden, who has promised to nominate a Black woman for the job whenever it is available. Officials insist that task isn\u2019t contingent on Breyer, but rather is something that any administration would do given the high stakes and the ever-present possibility of a departure. The fear, according to multiple Democrats, is that such a push could cause Breyer to dig in and decide to serve out beyond the 2022 midterms, when control of the 50-50 Senate is again at stake. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that that kind of pressure on Justice Breyer is actually helpful in his decision making,\u201d said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. \u201cI don\u2019t know the man well enough, but I know plenty of people whose backs would get up when subjected to that kind of pressure. And it\u2019s certainly plausible.\u201d Biden's pick to serve on powerful DC-based appellate says her experience as a Black jurist 'might be valuable' if confirmed Sen. Jack Reed, another Rhode Island Democrat who has known Breyer since he was an adviser of his at Harvard Law School, said of a pressure campaign: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it works.\u201d For his part, Breyer is silent on the issue, even after one liberal group hired a billboard truck to circle the Supreme Court building last month bearing the rhyming slogan, \u201cBreyer, Retire.\u201d His retirement likely would not change the court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority, but it could bring on board a younger justice to serve for decades. As a former Senate staffer himself, Breyer is well aware of how precarious the Democratic majority is in the Senate, with only a tie-vote majority and elderly members among its ranks. Breyer personally witnessed how the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg struggled to keep her cancer at bay long enough for a Democratic president to be elected and name her replacement. Ginsburg lost her battle two months before the election, clearing the way for then-President Donald Trump to fill her seat with the conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett. One House Democrat, Rep. Mondaire Jones of New York, has publicly called on Breyer to quit, citing Ginsburg\u2019s death as a cautionary tale for Democrats. \u201cMy goodness: Have we not learned our lesson?\u201d Jones told Cheddar News last month. The old guard of the judiciary moves on as Biden announces new picks for bench People close to Breyer say he loves his job and that he might now have a clearer understanding of why it was so difficult for Ginsburg to leave the marble palace. By outward appearances, he seems healthy and has been an active participant on the bench. He has appeared publicly, via Zoom, for speaking engagements this year more than any other justice. One former clerk, who declined to speak on the record, believes that Breyer will step down although has not spoken directly with his former boss on the subject. Those close to Breyer are infuriated by the retirement pressure from Demand Justice and others, even though they think he will still make his decision based on concern for the well-being of the institution and not because of pressure from liberal groups. In the meantime, progressives are armed with a short list that includes two African American women, California Supreme Court Justice Leondra Kruger and federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Jackson, a former Breyer clerk, has already been nominated to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Her hearing last week was seen as a test for a potential Supreme Court nomination. But the White House isn\u2019t talking about replacements, focusing instead on filling open seats on the federal bench. \u201cHe believes that\u2019s a decision Justice Breyer will make when he decides it\u2019s time to no longer serve on the Supreme Court,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said of Biden\u2019s position. If Breyer were to wait a term before stepping down it would give Jackson some seasoning on the DC appeals court, a prominent launching pad for justices such as Chief Justice John Roberts, Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, and the late Justices Ginsburg and Antonin Scalia. It would also leave Breyer, who has served on the bench for almost 30 years, to grapple with blockbuster issues that are likely to hit the court next term, among them gun rights, abortion and voting rights. He might feel like he has the experience and prior relationships to shape the progressive arguments in those cases and, perhaps, contain the damage. Breyer might also dislike the optics of stepping down now for fear it would be perceived as a political move. He often talks about the separation of powers, as he did last month in a speech at Harvard Law School. Stephen Breyer worries about Supreme Court's public standing in current political era If the public sees judges as \u201cpoliticians in robes, its confidence in the courts, and in the rule of law itself, can only diminish, diminishing the court\u2019s power, including its power to act as a check on the other branches,\u201d Breyer said. Some court watchers note that Breyer has hired a full complement of clerks for the next court term, taking it as a sign that he might stick around. \u201cI now believe that there\u2019s a 70-30 chance that Justice Breyer will remain on the court for at least one more term,\u201d lawyer David Lat wrote on his Original Jurisdiction Substack, where he reported Breyer\u2019s hiring of four clerks. Breyer, ever the pragmatic, may believe that the time is right for him to go, clearing the way for a younger progressive to build from his legacy. He may believe he has no role in naming his replacement and leave it to officials in the White House, with a President and Vice President Kamala Harris who both served on the Senate Judiciary committee, as well as chief of staff Ron Klain \u2013 who has worked in the judicial trenches for years \u2013 to make the decision. The White House Counsel\u2019s Office is fully staffed, led by White House Counsel Dana Remus. Remus, a former clerk to Justice Samuel Alito, has moved aggressively to fill lower court seats. How Amy Coney Barrett has changed the Supreme Court in ways Kavanaugh hasn't Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, told CNN he considers it \u201cpresumptuous\u201d to speculate, and others are of the same mind. Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Breyer\u2019s retirement would be a \u201cgreat loss.\u201d Now in her late 80s, the California Democrat has also heard recent calls from longtime supporters for her to retire and open up a Senate seat for someone else. \u201cMy general belief is, if a person is serving with integrity and working hard and producing for whatever the constituency is, that\u2019s what these jobs are all about,\u201d said Feinstein.",

            "article_content": "Justice Amy Coney Barrett has been on the job since late October, but until now, because Covid kept the justices apart, she had not been pictured with her colleagues. That changed Friday when the court released its new class photo depicting the junior-most justice with her colleagues. Class photo or no, the 49-year-old Barrett has made her presence known, plunging into work, actively participating in cases heard by telephone amidst the global pandemic. While there have been some clear signs that her vote has solidified the court\u2019s conservative majority, in other areas, Barrett remains more of a mystery \u2013 even drawing some concern from her allies. That\u2019s because the court has not released opinions in the most controversial cases of the term dealing with the issues such as the Affordable Care Act, religious liberty, unions and the Voting Rights Act. The newly released photos and video suggests that the justices, fully vaccinated, might finally all be working out of the court building which has been closed to the public for almost a year leaving the majestic crimson curtain-lined chamber empty. It could mean that in the tense final weeks of the term, there is a possibility that some justices could actually discuss these fraught issues in person, or at the very least, from the same building. Justice Amy Coney Barrett's first majority written opinion limits reach of FOIA They have already announced, however, that they won\u2019t physically take the bench for the remainder of the term that ends in June. In one area, concerning emergency petitions brought by houses of worship challenging state Covid restrictions, Barrett\u2019s vote has already made a critical impact. When liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was alive, the court sided with states in early disputes that featured Chief Justice John Roberts joining his liberal colleagues. But Barrett \u2013 Ginsburg\u2019s replacement \u2013 flipped the majority in later cases. On April 9, for example, a majority of the court penned an unsigned order siding with a pastor who sought to hold bible studies at home but was blocked from doing so because of California\u2019s restriction. \u201cThis is the fifth time the Court has summarily rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis of California\u2019s Covid restrictions on religious exercise,\u201d the majority held, rejecting a lower court\u2019s opinion and ruling in favor of the pastor. Roberts noted he would have ruled in favor of California but did not explain his thinking. Meanwhile, Justice Elena Kagan wrote for her two liberal colleagues rejecting the argument that the worshippers were being singled out for unfair treatment in violation of the First Amendment. California limited all small in-home gatherings \u2013 religious or secular \u2013 to three households, Kagan noted. She rejected the pastor\u2019s arguments that the state was treating religious worshipers differently. \u201cCalifornia need not,\u201d Kagan said, \u201ctreat at-home religious gatherings the same as hardware stores and hair salons.\u201d \u201cThe law does not require the State equally treat apples and watermelons,\u201d Kagan wrote. Although the court earlier in the month dismissed one of the last election 2020 related cases, as Barrett took the bench last fall, the justices were staring at a bevy of potential election related petitions. Some supporters of former President Donald Trump were dismayed that the court, including three of some of his nominees, ultimately didn\u2019t agree to take up requests to overturn election results. As the junior-most justice, it\u2019s unlikely Barrett will be assigned some of the bigger opinions this term usually reserved for more senior justices, but she has already penned two majority opinions in under the radar cases. But those who fought for Barrett\u2019s confirmation are eager to see how she will vote, particularly in a case concerning a Catholic adoption agency that refused to work with same-sex couples. Supreme Court ruling will make it easier to sentence juveniles to life sentence without parole Just this week, the court broke down along ideological lines over a case concerning whether a judge had to separately determine whether a juvenile offender could ever be rehabilitated before imposing a sentence of life without parole. In a 6-3 decision, the court said such a finding was not necessary, triggering a forceful dissent from the court\u2019s three liberals who charged the majority with overruling recent precedent without directly saying so. Justice Sonia Sotomayor signaled her pique at her conservative colleagues charging they had gutted recent precedent. \u201cThe Court is fooling no one,\u201d Sotomayor wrote. The justices are about to enter their busy season, racing to finish all opinions by the end of June, but they are also being pelted with requests to take up cases for next term. Barrett\u2019s vote on the so called \u201cshadow docket\u201d could make a big difference particularly because the cases concern issues such as abortion and the scope of the Second Amendment. Before Barrett joined the court, Roberts\u2019 vote was critical in those areas, but now there are five justices who can form a majority without him. Judges are split on how seriously to take John Roberts' abortion opinion One thing that Barrett has so far dodged is the more mundane assignments reserved for the court\u2019s newest members. Barrett, for instance, will automatically be placed on the court\u2019s cafeteria committee \u2013 relieving Brett Kavanaugh of his duties. It is a rite of passage \u2013 even a hazing \u2013 for new members, a task no one seems to relish especially because the cafeteria\u2019s food has a spotty reputation within the court. Kavanaugh\u2019s contribution during his tenure was a pizza-making station. Justice Neil Gorsuch dodged his responsibilities almost entirely, paling in comparison to Kagan, who brought in a frozen yogurt machine and set an impossibly high standard for any incoming future junior-most justice. Barrett has also gained some early controversy by reportedly signing a book deal with a $2 million advance \u2013 according to Politico which first reported the news and said the book would cover how judges are not supposed to bring their personal feelings into how they rule. Writing for Slate, Dahlia Lithwick said, \u201cthe notion of a justice who was rushed onto the court precisely because the president believed she would hand him the election if he needed her now holding forth on her mastery of open-mindedness is unseemly to the point of hinky.\u201d Barrett is far from the only justice who has authored a book on the bench. Retired Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, for instance, wrote a memoir based on her years growing up on a ranch out west. Justices Clarence Thomas and Sotomayor wrote books early in their tenure about their diverse family stories. Justice Stephen Breyer has penned books more closely related to the law as has Gorsuch. As for Barrett, she has not yet participated in speaking events, even over video, but an eventual book tour will likely produce an updated view of the justice who has yet to actually formally sit on the Supreme Court bench.",

            "article_content": "Justice Sonia Sotomayor emerged from pandemic-inspired unofficial quarantine on Wednesday to talk about turbulent times in the country. \u201cThis is the scariest of times, and the most exciting times,\u201d she said. The liberal justice appeared with her conservative colleague, Justice Neil Gorsuch, in a rare Zoom event to promote civic education and stress respect for differing opinions, with both justices speaking broadly about the importance of the rule of law and the Constitution. It comes as the justices have found themselves sequestered in their homes or chambers  hearing oral arguments by phone and contemplating divisive issues behind closed doors concerning the presidential election, abortion and health care, even as rioters attacked the Capitol across the street in January. Judges are split on how seriously to take John Roberts' abortion opinion \u201cI see the civil discourse as having many benefits. It\u2019s getting people engaged who otherwise haven\u2019t been,\u201d Sotomayor said and referenced the high turnout for the last election. \u201cYet at the same time we have seen some cracks in our system,\u201d she added. \u201cWe have a great deal of partisan, very heated debate going on, and that\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing but it can turn into an awful thing and into something that destroys the fabric of our community if we don\u2019t learn how to talk to each other,\u201d she said. The justices appeared to be speaking from their homes for an event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies titled \u201cCivics as a National Security Imperative.\u201d For his part, Gorsuch stressed collegiality and respect and held the court out as a good model of \u201chow democracy is supposed to work.\u201d He noted that the court is composed of people from \u201call across the country\u201d with \u201cradically different life experiences\u201d who share a love for the country. More than that, Gorsuch added, his colleagues \u201creally love one another, respect one another and listen to one another.\u201d Supreme Court again blocks California Covid restriction on religious activities RELATED: Who will be the next Antonin Scalia? Conservatives fight over his legacy He confessed that he and Sotomayor don\u2019t always agree, at which point she corrected him and joked that they \u201cdon\u2019t agree often.\u201d \u201cHow can a democracy function if we can\u2019t talk to one another and if we can\u2019t disagree kindly, with respect for one another\u2019s differences,\u201d Gorsuch said.",

            "article_content": "The Senate Leadership Fund will support Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski in her reelection campaign, setting up a clash between the Mitch McConnell-aligned group and GOP candidate Kelly Tshibaka, who has hired some advisers to former President Donald Trump. Trump plans to campaign against Murkowski after her vote to convict him in his second impeachment trial. But Murkowski, a Republican moderate on issues like abortion, has beat back candidates from the right before, and now has the backing of the group that spent over $476 million last election cycle \u2014 an astounding sum for Senate races. \u201cAlaska needs the kind of experienced representation that Lisa Murkowski provides in the United States Senate,\u201d said SLF President Steven Law. \u201cWhether fighting for Alaskan interests like expanding energy production and protecting fisheries, or advancing conservative priorities by confirming judges and cutting taxes, her strong leadership is vitally important to Alaska\u2019s future.\u201d The Alaska race is emerging as the first flashpoint between McConnell and Trump over the future of the Senate and the Republican Party. Trump has already endorsed a handful of incumbent senators, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Jerry Moran of Kansas. But after Murkowski voted to convict Trump in the second impeachment trial for inciting the insurrection at the Capitol, the former president pledged to campaign against her. \u201cShe represents her state badly and her country even worse,\u201d Trump said in March. \u201cI do not know where other people will be next year, but I know where I will be \u2013 in Alaska campaigning against a disloyal and very bad senator.\u201d McConnell quietly courts Senate primary candidates 'who can win' regardless of Trump ties Tshibaka, a former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner, launched her Senate campaign last month, pitching her campaign as an outsider taking on a powerful, longtime insider. \u201cIt\u2019s just like D.C. insiders to ignore the voices of Alaska voters to protect one of their own,\u201d said Mary Ann Pruitt, an adviser to the Tshibaka campaign, in response to the SLF\u2019s endorsement announcement. Murkowski and her family have long served the state. Her father, former Gov. Frank Murkowski, appointed her to his old Senate seat in 2002, and she won the office in 2004 and in 2010, when she lost the GOP primary to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller. She then waged a rarely successful write-in campaign, winning reelection in 2016 by 15 points. Murkowski has been one of the rare swing votes in the Senate GOP conference. She voted for the Trump administration\u2019s 2017 tax overhaul bill, which included a provision to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling in her home state. But she opposed the Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act and the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh following his sexual assault allegations, which he vigorously denied. The senator did not vote for Trump in 2020 and told The Hill she wrote in someone else who lost. Those votes have earned her praise from the middle. And in 2022, Murkowski may benefit from a new system where candidates run together in a nonpartisan primary, and the top four finishers advance to the general election, in which voters rank their preferences. But those votes have also earned her scorn from some on the right. The Alaska Republican Party censured her in a resolution after her impeachment vote, and said it would \u201crecruit\u201d a Republican challenger. The Alaska GOP later tweeted out a line from a Fox News story announcing Tshibaka\u2019s bid. Tshibaka will try to exploit a Trump-inspired backlash against the senator, hiring National Public Affairs, a political consulting firm run by Trump\u2019s top 2020 strategists, and Line Drive Public Affairs\u2019 Tim Murtaugh, Trump\u2019s former campaign communications director. Alaska operative Mary Ann Pruitt, who worked on the 2016 Murkowski campaign, is also advising Tshibaka\u2019s bid. In her video, Tshibaka called Murkowski \u201cso out of touch\u201d for voting \u201cto remove Donald Trump from office, even after he was already gone.\u201d Trump won Alaska by 10 points in 2020. So far, Tshibaka\u2019s candidacy presents the sharpest distinction between the McConnell and Trump orbits. Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks has also received Trump\u2019s endorsement for Senate after leading the charge to challenge the 2020 election, which could cause some heartburn for the business-wing of the GOP, but neither SLF nor McConnell has backed any candidate in the state. Before joining Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy\u2019s administration, Tshibaka worked in the offices of the inspector general for the US Postal Service, Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. Tshibaka acknowledged she worked in Washington, DC but \u201cfought to expose waste and fraud in government,\u201d seeking to draw a contrast with Murkowski\u2019s extensive experience in the Capitol. Murkowski filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on March 9 but has not officially announced her reelection bid and been somewhat coy about her 2022 intentions. But Kevin Sweeney, a political consultant for the Murkowski campaign, welcomed the endorsement from SLF, saying they \u201cexpect to build a broad coalition of support when we officially kick off the campaign.\u201d The senator has retained the support of other top Republicans besides Trump, including McConnell, who has said he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d support Murkowski. Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan has also said he\u2019d support Murkowski too, \u201cif\u201d she runs again. \u201cMany politicians put themselves first, but Lisa Murkowski always puts Alaska first,\u201d said Law on Friday. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Matt Gaetz, attempting to stare down a federal investigation into sex trafficking allegations, is reaching for a familiar, in-your-face strategy perfected over the last four years by the man who fueled his unconventional rise, former President Donald Trump. Hours after news of the investigation went public, the Florida Republican went on Fox News to deny any wrongdoing and claim he was the victim of an elaborate extortion scheme. Then he wrote an op-ed declaring he \u201cabsolutely\u201d would not resign. Gaetz\u2019s campaign sent out fundraising pleas blaming the media for trying to take him down. And on Friday, Gaetz is keeping plans for a longstanding speaking engagement that will unfold squarely in the public eye. It just so happens to be located at the Trump National Doral golf resort, the Miami property of the former president himself. Gaetz\u2019s response to the FBI investigation into whether the GOP congressman broke federal sex trafficking laws and had a relationship with a 17-year-old girl is reminiscent of the combative path that Gaetz has taken from the Florida statehouse to the US Capitol as he became one Trump\u2019s congressional allies. The son of a prominent Florida politician and businessman, Gaetz arrived in Washington in 2017 along with Trump and quickly focused his attention not on forging relationships in Congress and passing legislation but on building his personal brand, going on television and getting close to the new president. \u201cHe really jumped on the Trump train and rode it all the way to the end,\u201d said one former Gaetz aide, who agreed to speak candidly about office dynamics on the condition of anonymity. \u201cAs time went on, there was a noticeable shift of focus \u2013 more so to what can I do to get on Fox at night? \u2026 Once he had a little taste of that, he couldn\u2019t shake it anymore, that became the focus of the office.\u201d It was a strategy that led to presidential Twitter shoutouts, trips on Air Force One and a regular spot in Fox News\u2019 primetime guest lineup. But his brash style courting controversy and his reputation surrounding women turned off many of his Republican colleagues, GOP lawmakers and aides say. Gaetz now has few GOP allies speaking out on his behalf as the federal investigation hangs over his head. Most Republicans are staying quiet. Gaetz is close to Trump, even getting engaged in December at his Mar-a-Lago resort. But the former President, who praised Gaetz for defending him through numerous controversies and two impeachments, hasn\u2019t been eager to reciprocate. After The New York Times, CNN and others reported this week that Gaetz sought a preemptive pardon \u2013 a spokesperson for Gaetz denied to the Times it was related to the Justice Department investigation \u2013 Trump issued a terse statement. \u201cCongressman Matt Gaetz has never asked me for a pardon,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt must also be remembered that he has totally denied the accusations against him.\u201d Like Trump, Gaetz has not been shy about his sexual exploits, bragging about them along with his access to the President in his book released last year. Gaetz even said he took a call from Trump while \u201cin the throes of passion.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like watching the sunrise while kissing in a hot tub with a Secret Service perimeter protecting you,\u201d Gaetz wrote in the book about a party at Mar-a-Lago. While Gaetz has acknowledged his background is far from perfect, he has denied a relationship with a 17-year-old or breaking any other laws. \u201cMy lifestyle of yesteryear may be different from how I live now, but it was not and is not illegal,\u201d Gaetz wrote in the op-ed. Gaetz was born in Hollywood, Florida, and grew up in the panhandle, where his childhood home had a unique distinction: It was used as the house to film the movie \u201cThe Truman Show.\u201d \u201cIn the mid-90s, one day some producer just shows up in a golf cart and tells my mother that they want to make a movie in this house starring Jim Carrey,\u201d Gaetz said in the HBO documentary \u201cThe Swamp.\u201d Gaetz\u2019s mother, Vicky Gaetz, is partially paralyzed after she suffered severe complications while pregnant with his sister. He told The Washington Post in 2018 it\u2019s one reason he believes abortion should be illegal, after his mother was advised to terminate the pregnancy and did not do so. His father, Don Gaetz, made millions in 2004 selling the hospice company that he had founded. Don Gaetz was elected to the state Senate in 2006 and would rise to Senate president in 2012 before leaving office in 2016 due to term limits. The younger Gaetz graduated from William and Mary law school and worked as an attorney in Florida for several years before he joined his father in the state House in 2010 when he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives. Gaetz began cementing his brash reputation in Tallahassee, where he also was given the moniker \u201cBaby Gaetz\u201d while working alongside his father, according to local media reports. \u201cIf you want to live in a state where you can ride around in your Uber, with your sidearm on your side, picking your fantasy lineup, on your way to a potential cannabis treatment, that\u2019s the type of liberty environment I want to live in,\u201d Gaetz said at a 2016 Chamber of Commerce event. When former Florida Republican Rep. Jeff Miller announced he was retiring from Congress in 2016, Gaetz jumped into and won a crowded GOP primary, sending him to Congress in 2017. As the investigation surrounding Trump and Russia unfolded during Gaetz\u2019 first year in office, Gaetz was part of a group of vocal Republicans attacking then-special counsel Robert Mueller, winning his good graces with Trump. Gaetz also made a concerted effort to get on television, another key avenue to reach Trump. \u201cSpeaker of the House Paul Ryan once knocked me for going on TV too much, without considering that maybe his own failures as a leader stemmed from spending too much time in think tanks instead of in the green rooms where guests wait to appear on TV, and are thereby connected to the dinnertime of real Americans,\u201d Gaetz wrote in his book. Gaetz courted controversy in numerous ways, earning him notoriety in the House \u2013 along with television appearances in conservative media. In 2018, he was criticized after he invited a conservative troll with a history of Holocaust denial to the State of the Union. A year later, Gaetz threatened Trump\u2019s former fixer Michael Cohen ahead of his 2019 House testimony, tweeting, \u201cDo your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat.\u201d He was admonished by the House Ethics Committee and investigated and cleared by the Florida Bar over the tweet, which he deleted and apologized for. During the House\u2019s first impeachment inquiry, Gaetz led a band of Republicans in a stunt to \u201cstorm\u201d the House Intelligence secure committee spaces where the impeachment interviews were being held. And last year, Gaetz wore a gas mask on the House floor to vote on a coronavirus funding package. Gaetz is better known for his stunts than legislating, but one vote has attracted renewed attention in the wake of the DOJ investigation. In 2017, Gaetz was the only member of Congress to vote against an anti-human trafficking bill, legislation that Trump signed into law. Defending his vote against the legislation at the time, Gaetz said in a Facebook video he was opposed to the parts of the legislation that called for more federal involvement, and that his vote was not about human trafficking. Gaetz\u2019s antics have won him praise from Trump, although Trump was briefly angry with Gaetz last year over his support of an Iran war powers resolution to curb the President\u2019s power. \u201cThey are our warriors,\u201d Trump said of Gaetz and other House members at a September 2020 rally in Jupiter, Florida. \u201cYou see what they do? They have to fight Pelosi, Schumer, they have to fight all these characters. And they do very well in the fights. We want them on our side.\u201d Behind the scenes in the House, Gaetz didn\u2019t make many friends in the House Republican conference, while the backbench congressman became one of the most regular lawmakers to appear on Fox News, going around the traditional power structures on Capitol Hill. Gaetz\u2019s also gained a reputation in the House involving his relationships with women, including showing pictures of nude women he said he slept with to his colleagues, sources told CNN. The staff of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan had a meeting with Gaetz in his first term to remind him about acting professionally while in Congress, according to two sources. One source said the conversation wasn\u2019t tied to a specific incident. A Gaetz spokesperson denied the meeting took place. Gaetz has been more than willing to take on his party leaders \u2013 particularly those who cross Trump. He echoed Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election being stolen and even defended Trump in the hours after the deadly January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. When House GOP Conference Chair Liz Cheney of Wyoming voted to impeach Trump in January, Gaetz didn\u2019t just criticize her \u2013 he traveled to Wyoming to hold a rally denouncing her. Gaetz\u2019s defenders argue he represents Republican voters better than party leaders. \u201cHe understands the nature of the Republican Party, loves the base of the Republican Party, he listens to them,\u201d said Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, a congressional candidate who did not overlap with Gaetz in the Florida statehouse but has become friends with him. \u201cAnd I find that very commendable because most of the politicians don\u2019t listen to the people.\u201d Gaetz has often sparred with Democrats, including a notable 2020 exchange with former Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana at a hearing following the death of George Floyd. \u201cAre you suggesting that you\u2019re certain that none of us have nonwhite children? Because you reflect on your Black son, and you say none of us could understand\u201d Gaetz said. A day later, Gaetz, who is unmarried, tweeted that he had raised a 19-year-old adult son, Nestor, the brother of an ex-girlfriend who immigrated from Cuba when he was 12. But Gaetz also came to the defense of an embattled Democrat, then-Rep. Katie Hill of California, when she resigned in 2019 over a relationship with a campaign staffer, when nude photos of her were leaked without her consent. \u201cThis is absurd,\u201d Gaetz tweeted in response to the House Ethics Committee opening up an investigation. \u201cWho among us would look perfect if every ex leaked every photo/text?\u201d This week, as the Gaetz allegations unfolded in public view, Hill wrote an op-ed noting that Gaetz was one of the few lawmakers to stand up for her. \u201cAt one of the darkest moments of my life, when I was feeling more alone than I ever had, Matt stood up for me \u2014 and that really mattered,\u201d she wrote. But Hill also wrote that Gaetz had \u201cengaged in the very practice he\u2019d defended me from\u201d by reportedly sharing images of nude women, and he should be held responsible if the allegations against him are proven. \u201cIf there is even a fraction of truth to these reports,\u201d Hill wrote, \u201che should resign immediately.\u201d CNN\u2019s Michael Conte contributed to this report.",

The ever-moving tectonic shift underneath American politics is prime for another quake as civil rights starts to outweigh corporate tax rates in the calculating minds of big American businesses. Corporate America\u2019s years-long move toward a political awakening has increasingly put large companies in direct opposition to the GOP, a political party that spent generations crusading as the friend of business and slasher of corporate taxes. \u201cOur private sector must stop taking cues from the Outrage-Industrial Complex,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday in a written statement, in which he also accused companies and Democrats of \u201cdisinformation.\u201d \u201cAmericans do not need or want big business to amplify disinformation or react to every manufactured controversy with frantic left-wing signaling,\u201d he said. Related: Fact Check: What the Georgia election law actually does The decision by Major League Baseball, after President Joe Biden endorsed it, to move its 2021 All-Star Game out of Georgia to protest that state\u2019s newly restrictive voting laws is only the newest example. The Trump years accelerated the desire of large companies to at least appear responsive to civil rights. Companies severed ties with the soon-to-be President over his comments about immigrants just as his campaign was gaining steam, a move that seems strange in hindsight since his major legislative accomplishment was a permanent cut in corporate tax rates. Now, the Biden administration is plotting to raise corporate rates without help from Republicans and pay for a massive infrastructure plan. The GOP effort to stop Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan is built around making voters see it as a tax hike rather than a necessary upgrade to the country\u2019s infrastructure and reliance on carbon-emitting fuels. Whether large companies see the tax hikes or the government spending as a bigger boon will have to wait. Right now, big business is most vocal in its disapproval of the GOP\u2019s naked effort to cut down on Democratic votes and reclaim the House and Senate in 2022. Let\u2019s not assume that public companies, generally, do things because they\u2019re the right thing to do, but rather acknowledge they are legally required to be motivated by the bottom line. So it says something about the direction of the company and the importance of perception that a company like Delta would condemn Georgia\u2019s new law and, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, tempt Republicans to revoke of a state tax cut related to jet fuel, is notable. Republicans, meanwhile, are pointing out the hypocrisy of companies like Delta and Coca-Cola calling out the Georgia voting rights law, while also, as multi-national corporations do, pursuing business in China. As Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, said in a tweet: Dear @Delta: You are business partners with the Communist Party of #China When can we expect your letter saying that their ongoing genocide in #Xinjiang is \u201cunacceptable and does not match Delta\u2019s values\u201d??? #WokeCorporateHypocrites The Wall Street Journal wondered if Biden\u2019s endorsement of sports boycotts related to justice will extend from the Georgia law to the upcoming Winter Olympics scheduled to take place in 2022. The activists pushing for changes in places like Georgia aren\u2019t exactly satisfied with the corporate nods, which will have a debatable effect in Georgia, where the law has already been put in effect and now faces a court battle. Republicans in other states, however, have their own plans to make voting more difficult. The Georgia example could certainly have an impact in those places. \u201cThese companies sell their products across the country, and across the country there are Black and brown voters who need to know they\u2019re not being left behind,\u201d Stacey Abrams, the voting rights leader, told the Journal-Constitution of the companies who have spoken up more forcefully now that the Georgia law is in place but were \u201cmealy-mouthed\u201d when it was being debated. Another thing to consider is the evolution of culture wars in the US. While few companies will want to take a stand on a issue like abortion, that is complicated by personal and religious beliefs, it\u2019s much easier for companies to take stands on something as simple as voting rights. Of course the government should be making it easier for people to vote. Other companies might be looking for some image rehab of their own. Facebook, Twitter and Google, targets of Democratic frustration about access to misinformation on their sites and Republican allegations they minimize conservative views, have all criticized the Georgia law and some have endorsed Democrats\u2019 proposal to create more national voting standards. The journey to corporate wokeness has been a long time in the making. A boycott of Arizona for an law widely perceived as anti-immigrant may have cost the state more than $100 million, but it largely fizzled after courts defanged the state law. North Carolina\u2019s anti-transgender \u201cbathroom bill\u201d led to boycotts by sports leagues and other companies in 2016 and cost the state\u2019s economy more than $3.75 billion, according to an AP analysis. State leaders, after the Republican governor lost his bid for reelection, rolled back elements of the law. Nike is enough invested in the perception of social justice that it sponsors a quarterback, Colin Kaepernick, who says he\u2019s been blackballed by the league. The NFL, while not finding room for Kaepernick on a roster, has pledged to spend $250 million to fight systemic racism.",

            "article_content": "Justice Clarence Thomas suggested on Monday that Congress should consider whether laws should be updated to better regulate social media platforms that, he said, have come to have \u201cunbridled control\u201d over \u201cunprecedented\u201d amounts of speech. The provocative and controversial opinion comes as Twitter banned former President Donald Trump from its platform for violating its rules on incitement of violence and some conservatives have called on more regulations in the tech world to combat what they view as political bias on social media. \u201cIf part of the problem is private, concentrated control over online content and platforms available to the public, then part of the solution may be found in doctrines that limit the right of a private company to exclude, \u201d Thomas wrote in a 12-page concurring opinion Monday. Who will be the next Antonin Scalia? Conservatives fight over his legacy Thomas\u2019s stance will raise concerns from critics who point out that social media platforms have not historically been subject to such content regulation, but instead have been left to devise their policies on their own. \u201cJustice Thomas\u2019s opinion represents the first time that we\u2019ve seen a Supreme Court Justice appear to endorse the view increasingly prevalent among conservatives that private social media platforms should potentially be subject to significant government regulation notwithstanding the First Amendment,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. No other justice joined Thomas\u2019s opinion, that came as he agreed with the court\u2019s decision to dismiss a case concerning Trump\u2019s use of Twitter while he was President. Thomas said the court was right to dismiss the case that predated the election and Twitter\u2019s decision to ban Trump after the Capitol Hill riot. But Thomas said the issue caused him to think about the \u201cprincipal legal difficulty that surrounds\u201d a digital platform, specifically the concentration of power in the hands of so few owners at social media companies. He took the opportunity to suggest further exploration which could lead to a sea change for tech platforms if it ever gained traction. Today\u2019s digital platforms, Thomas argued, \u201cprovide avenues for historically unprecedented amounts of speech,\u201d but he said it also concentrates control \u201cof so much speech in the hands of a few private parties.\u201d Supreme Court wipes away ruling that said Trump violated Constitution by blocking Twitter followers In particular he pointed out that Twitter was able to remove any person from the platform \u2013 \u201ceven the President of the United States.\u201d \u201cAs Twitter made clear, the right to cut off speech lies most powerfully in the hands of private digital platforms,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe extent to which that power matters for purposes of the First Amendment and the extent to which that power could lawfully be modified raise interesting and important questions,\u201d he added. Thomas has a history of using solo dissents or concurring opinions to press an issue that he thinks deserves more contemplation. In 2019 he used one abortion dispute to write a concurrence about his fear that abortion could become a \u201ctool of eugenic manipulation.\u201d In 2019, he called for reconsideration of a landmark First Amendment precedent New York Times v. Sullivan, which makes it more difficult for public figures to sue for defamation, opining that the decision that was a \u201cpolicy-driven\u201d decision \u201cmasquerading as constitutional law.\u201d And earlier this year, Thomas in a dissent revealed some support for Trump and Republicans who have refused to accept the result of the 2020 election. \u201cWe are fortunate that many of the cases we have seen alleged only improper rule changes, not fraud. But that observation provides only small comfort,\u201d Thomas said, dissenting as the court rejected a long-pending challenge to Pennsylvania mail-in voting procedures. Monday, Thomas emphasized that Facebook, controlled by Mark Zuckerberg, has nearly 3 billion people who use and that Google brought in $182.5 billion last year, 40.3 billion in net income. The conservative justice said that the court will soon have \u201cno choice\u201d but to address how legal doctrines apply to \u201cprivately owned information infrastructure such as digital platforms.\u201d He questioned whether the platforms should be viewed as \u201ccommon carriers\u201d like train services and telephone companies that have historically been subject to government regulations because of the essential service they provide to the public. Katie Fallow, a First Amendment expert at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University said that the group actually shares Thomas concern about the power over speech being concentrated in the hands of so few. \u201cBut we think that concentrating that same power in the hands of government regulators will not necessarily solve the problems associated with social media companies.\u201d Instead, she worried it might exacerbate the issue. Justice Clarence Thomas reveals some sympathy for Trump's baseless fraud claims \u201cSo even if the platforms were treated as \u2018common carriers,\u2019\u201d she said any attempt to regulate the content of the platforms\u2019 content \u201cwould raise significant First Amendment concerns.\u201d Vladeck noted that none of the justices joined Thomas in his opinion Monday and the real question is whether they will embrace this stance in the future. \u201cOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Justice Thomas has offered an idiosyncratic view of the First Amendment,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cThe bigger question is whether any of his colleagues agree with him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Immediately after Major League Baseball announced it was moving this year\u2019s All-Star Game out of Georgia in response to the state\u2019s new law that makes it harder to vote, state Republicans behind the law blamed some of its leading Democratic critics \u2013 including Stacey Abrams. After acting on former President Donald Trump\u2019s big lie that the 2020 election was stolen by enacting new restrictions on voting, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and House Speaker David Ralston, both Republicans, tried to spin the reality of the law they\u2019d passed by blaming the backlash it has provoked on \u201clies\u201d from the left. \u201cThis attack on our state is the direct result of repeated lies\u201d from Abrams and President Joe Biden, Kemp said. \u201cStacey Abrams\u2019 leftist lies have stolen the All-Star Game from Georgia,\u201d Ralston said. But Abrams, the leading voting rights activist and former candidate for governor, had a different message for businesses and event hosts considering whether to pull out of Georgia: \u201cStay and fight.\u201d Abrams and other critics of the new law that imposes a raft of voting restrictions, passed by the GOP-controlled legislature and signed into law by Kemp last week, said they want corporations and associations to fight to reverse the law alongside them, rather than abandoning the state. Republicans press ahead with voting restrictions in key states, even as legal fights mount over new Georgia law \u201cI urge those who can to come and speak out, and I urge those who are here to stay and fight, to stay and vote. We need you,\u201d Abrams said in a statement Friday afternoon shortly after the MLB announced its decision. The business backlash in Georgia and other states where Republican lawmakers are advancing bills that would impose new voting restrictions \u2013 including Texas, where American Airlines and Dell lambasted the GOP legislation this week \u2013 is reminiscent of another recent fight: North Carolina\u2019s so-called \u201cbathroom bill.\u201d The NCAA pulled tournaments out of the state in 2017 after the state passed a law that said people in government-run facilities could only use bathrooms and locker rooms that correspond to the sex on their birth certificate. In practice, the law meant that many transgender and nonbinary people were unable to use a restroom in government buildings, and felt unsafe to do so elsewhere in public. The NBA delayed its plans to hold its All-Star Game in Charlotte by two years. Adidas, PayPal, Deutsche Bank and other companies scrapped plans for new facilities in the state. Abrams and other leading Georgia Democrats said Friday they are worried about who will be penalized by the economic fallout of Georgia\u2019s voter suppression law. \u201cI respect boycotts, although I don\u2019t want to see Georgia families hurt by lost events and jobs. Georgians targeted by voter suppression will be hurt as opportunities go to other states. We should not abandon the victims of GOP malice and lies \u2013 we must stand together,\u201d Abrams said. Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock similarly said that while he respects MLB\u2019s decision, he hopes to see those with influence fight against the state\u2019s new law in person rather than boycotting Georgia. \u201cIt is my hope that businesses, athletes, and entertainers can protest this law not by leaving Georgia but by coming here and fighting voter suppression head on, and hand-in-hand with the community,\u201d Warnock said in a statement. That\u2019s not what MLB decided to do. \u201cI have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year\u2019s All-Star Game and MLB Draft,\u201d MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. \u201cMajor League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box.\u201d MLB\u2019s decision, and the reactions from Abrams, Warnock and other Georgia Democrats, underscored the big questions those making decisions about doing business in the state now face about how to most effectively demonstrate their opposition to the voting law \u2013 both in the state, where activists still hope to fight it, and to a broader national audience. Georgia-based businesses, including Coca-Cola and Delta Air Lines, have criticized the new law. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a memo Wednesday \u2013 which came after criticism of Delta for not being vocal enough in opposing Georgia\u2019s new law \u2013 that the \u201centire rationale for this bill was based on a lie: that there was widespread voter fraud in Georgia in the 2020 elections. This is simply not true.\u201d The companies quickly faced criticism from Republicans, including Kemp, who said Bastian \u201ccontinues to spread the same false attacks being repeated by partisan activists.\u201d On Friday, Kemp, Ralston and other Georgia Republicans blamed Abrams for \u201clies\u201d about the new voting law. \u201cGeorgians \u2013 and all Americans \u2013 should fully understand what the MLB\u2019s knee-jerk decision means: cancel culture and woke political activists are coming for every aspect of your life, sports included. If the left doesn\u2019t agree with you, facts and the truth do not matter,\u201d Kemp said. \u201cTotally caving to the lies of the Left. Boycott the MLB,\u201d US Rep. Buddy Carter tweeted. But its passage was built on the premise of the falsehoods and distortions of Trump: That widespread fraud in the 2020 election was responsible for his loss to Biden. Kemp\u2019s complaints about \u201ccancel culture\u201d follow an effort by the governor and other Georgia Republicans to make it more difficult to vote \u2013 especially for Black and brown people who experts say will face the most harm as a result of the new law \u2013 after Democrats won the state in a presidential election for the first time since 1992. How the Supreme Court laid the path for Georgia's new election law Democrats, meanwhile, said it\u2019s up to the same Republicans that passed the voting law to halt the economic blowback they created. \u201cUnfortunately, the removal of the MLB All Star game from GA is likely the 1st of many dominoes to fall, until the unnecessary barriers put in place to restrict access to the ballot box are removed,\u201d Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms tweeted. Abrams for years has said she respects boycotts, but believes they don\u2019t have the effect of stopping the laws that prompt them. \u201cI believe that people should follow their values and if they believe that the refusal to invest makes sense, I understand that,\u201d she told the Los Angeles Times in 2019, after Georgia passed a strict anti-abortion law that prompted calls for major movie studios to boycott the state\u2019s film production industry. \u201cWhile an industry boycott could have an effect, it will not have the effect of actually stopping the laws. We have to recognize that the men who are pushing this law \u2013 and it\u2019s mostly men \u2013 they truly do not care about the lives of those they are affecting, and they are not to be persuaded by an economic boycott,\u201d she said then. \u201cIn fact, if you listen to some of the pundits who\u2019ve been on the air, they say, \u2018Let\u2019s let Hollywood boycott us.\u2019 Because they think it actually makes them look stronger at home.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republican Kelly Tshibaka, a former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner, launched her Senate campaign on Monday against Sen. Lisa Murkowski, pitching the election as an outsider versus a powerful, longtime insider. \u201cWe know what Washington, DC thinks about Alaska: We\u2019re here for their benefit; we\u2019re not going to put up much of a fight,\u201d said Tshibaka in a video. \u201cAfter about 20 years in DC, Lisa Murkowski thinks the same way.\u201d Murkowski, a Republican moderate on issues like abortion, has beat back candidates from the right before. Her father, former Gov. Frank Murkowski, appointed her to his old Senate seat in 2002, and she won the office in 2004, and in 2010, when she lost the GOP primary to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller but then waged a rarely successful write-in campaign. She then won reelection in 2016 by 15 points. In 2022, Murkowski may benefit from a new system, where candidates run together in a nonpartisan primary, and the top four finishers advance to the general election, in which voters rank their preferences. But Murkowski\u2019s criticisms of former President Donald Trump, including her vote to convict him in the second impeachment trial for inciting the January 6 riot at the Capitol, could make her vulnerable to another conservative challenger. The senator did not vote for the former President in 2020 and told The Hill she wrote in someone else who lost. Earlier this month, Trump said that he planned to campaign against Murkowski, calling her \u201ca disloyal and very bad Senator.\u201d The Alaska Republican Party also censured her in a resolution following the impeachment vote, and said it would \u201crecruit\u201d a Republican challenger. It was unclear Monday if Tshibaka had been asked to run by the party, although the Alaska GOP tweeted out a line from a Fox News story announcing her bid. CNN has reached out to the Alaska GOP for comment on Tshibaka\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s clear, however, that Tshibaka will try to exploit a Trump-inspired backlash against Murkowski, after hiring National Public Affairs, a political consulting firm run by Trump\u2019s top 2020 strategists, and Line Drive Public Affairs\u2019 Tim Murtaugh, Trump\u2019s former campaign communications director, according to people familiar (Politico first reported the hires). Alaska operative Mary Ann Pruitt, who worked on the 2016 Murkowski campaign, is also advising Tshibaka\u2019s bid . In her video, Tshibaka called Murkowski \u201cso out of touch\u201d for voting \u201cto remove Donald Trump from office, even after he was already gone.\u201d Trump won Alaska by 10 points in 2020. Before joining Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy\u2019s administration, Tshibaka worked in the offices of the inspector general for the US Postal Service, Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice. Tshibaka acknowledged she worked in Washington, DC but \u201cfought to expose waste and fraud in government,\u201d seeking to draw a contrast with Murkowski\u2019s extensive experience in the Capitol. Murkowski filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission on March 9 but has been somewhat coy about her 2022 intentions. A spokeswoman for Murkowski did not respond to request for comment. The senator has retained the support of other top Republicans besides Trump, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who recently said he will \u201cabsolutely\u201d support Murkowski. Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan said Sunday on ABC that he\u2019d support Murkowski too, \u201cif\u201d she runs again. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "National Republican groups are working to drive the state-by-state GOP efforts to limit voting \u2013 offering guidance to the state lawmakers drafting laws to restrict ballot access, deploying grassroots activists to key battlegrounds and raising millions of dollars to block efforts by Democrats in Congress to establish a national baseline for voting rights. Heritage Action for America, the political arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, has publicly committed to spending at least $10 million to \u201csecure and strengthen state election systems.\u201d And guidelines sent out earlier this year by the Heritage Foundation \u2013 including extending identification requirements to absentee voting and barring third-party groups from collecting voters\u2019 absentee ballots \u2013 have emerged in bills now racing through the Legislature in Georgia and other statehouses. Organizations ranging from the libertarian-leaning advocacy group FreedomWorks to the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List also have jumped into the voting rights battle this year.   The involvement of national groups shows that efforts to restrict voting in dozens of states \u201care not a coincidence,\u201d said Hillary Holley, organizing director of the Georgia-based voting rights group Fair Fight Action. \u201cThis is a strategic imperative that\u2019s well-funded.\u201d The Republican-controlled House in Georgia is slated to vote Thursday on a package of voting changes that include limiting ballot drop boxes, requiring identification for absentee ballots and making it a misdemeanor to give food or soft drinks to voters waiting in line to cast their ballots. Officials with Heritage Action say roughly 20,000 of its activists are working on the ground in the state to encourage its passage. Lawmakers in the Peach State are expected to take final action on the measures next week before adjourning. That puts Georgia on track to become the second Republican-controlled state this year to pass major legislation clamping down on ballot access. Earlier this month, Iowa passed its own restrictions, including cutting down the number of days available for early voting. In all, more than 40 states were considering bills that include voting restrictions as of mid-February, according to the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Since then, more have joined in. On Wednesday, Republican lawmakers in Michigan \u2013 another presidential battleground \u2013 introduced a package of 39 election bills. They include new voter ID requirements and a ban on prepaid postage for absentee ballots. The leaders of Republican groups say they have joined the fray because worries about election fraud have become an animating force for conservative activists in the wake of the 2020 elections. Last year saw a dramatic increase in the use of mail-in voting, ballot drop boxes and other tools to avoid spreading the coronavirus. Turnout surged to record levels, helping Democrats take the White House and the US Senate majority. Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly made false claims that widespread voter fraud contributed to his defeat last November, and Republican lawmakers have cited an erosion of public confidence as a key reason they are racing to tighten voting laws. \u201cIf voters don\u2019t have trust in our elections, then voting turnout will be suppressed,\u201d Jessica Anderson, the executive director of Heritage Action, said in an email to CNN. She said her group will \u201cspend whatever it takes to reach our goals.\u201d Ken Cuccinelli, who helped run the Department of Homeland Security in the Trump administration, now oversees the Election Transparency Initiative \u2013 a joint effort of The Susan B. Anthony List and another group focused on social issues, American Principles Project. His initiative has a roughly $5 million budget and its goals include stopping a sweeping elections and campaign finance bill Democrats hope to advance in the US Senate. \u201cWhy is a pro-life and social conservative group engaging in this space?\u201d Cuccinelli said in an interview this week. \u201cThe sort of simple answer is: Our members are effectively demanding it.\u201d \u201cOther groups are seeing the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are having members who are asking the question: \u2018Why should I give you any money? Why should I knock on doors? Why should I write my congressman when these elections are moving in the direction of being a sham?\u2019 \u201c Cuccinelli argues that congressional Democrats are trying to expand voting in ways that are unpopular with Americans, such as allowing voters to sign an affidavit, rather than presenting identification to vote. Other Republican organizations that have launched new voting initiatives include the Republican National Committee and the Republican State Leadership Committee. FreedomWorks recently added Cleta Mitchell \u2013 a veteran GOP elections lawyer who assisted Trump on a January call in which he urged Georgia officials to \u201cfind\u201d him votes \u2013 to run its national \u201celection protection initiative.\u201d The effort will focus on \u201celection integrity\u201d in seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Honest Elections Project, a conservative group launched to work on voting issues, has issued its own list of \u201cbest practices\u201d for elections that include more photo identification. Honest Elections\u2019 director, Jason Snead, a former Heritage policy analyst, said no evidence \u201chas yet to be produced\u201d showing widespread fraud that would have changed the 2020 election results. But he said that shouldn\u2019t stop states from pursuing safeguards. \u201cWe do not live in a country, thankfully, where we see a lot of bank robberies going on,\u201d Snead said. \u201cBut every bank in the country still has security systems in place, and they are not going to get rid of them.\u201d The groups are fighting on a dual track. Even as GOP lawmakers work to help advance bills at the state level, national Republican organizations are waging an aggressive campaign against the so-called For the People Act, a far-reaching congressional bill that would bring sweeping change to the ways in which elections are conducted and funded. The bill, which has passed the Democratic-controlled House and is under consideration in the Senate, would effectively establish a federal floor on voting procedures \u2013 requiring, for instance, 15 days of early voting, prepaid postage on absentee ballots and voter registration on the same day as the election. Progressive groups, which also plan to plow millions into the fight to support the Senate bill, describe the legislation as potentially their last chance to preserve voting rights as Republican lawmakers race to erect more barriers to the ballot at the state level. Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, cast the Senate measure as federal overreach. \u201cThis legislation would forcibly rewrite the election laws of all 50 states,\u201d McConnell said during a Senate hearing Wednesday. Right now, Democrats lack the votes to change Senate rules to eliminate the 60-vote threshold required to overcome a filibuster on the legislation. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is the only Democrat not to sign on to the voting bill in the Senate, and the conservative Democrat is a leading proponent of preserving the filibuster. FreedomWorks plans a \u201cmulti-seven-figure\u201d campaign on voting issues that will include keeping pressure on Democrats such as Manchin to retain the filibuster, according to FreedomWorks spokesman Peter Vicenzi. Over the weekend, activists tied to two of the conservative groups at the forefront of voting battles \u2013 FreedomWorks and Heritage Action \u2013 staged a rally outside the West Virginia State Capitol, urging Manchin to stay the course.",

            "article_content": "Some conservatives who pushed and prodded for the Senate to quickly confirm Amy Coney Barrett to succeed the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court last fall are rattled by what they have seen so far. Barrett has only been on the bench since late October, providing an exceedingly small sample size, but her votes not backing President Donald Trump in attempting to overturn the 2020 election as well as a mixed ruling in a clash between houses of worship and California have brought concern to some who heralded her nomination. The nervousness so early in her tenure reveals more about the high hopes of the conservative movement that has finally obtained a 6-3 majority than it does about Barrett\u2019s own jurisprudence. \u201cYou have a lot of people in the conservative movement who are so far disappointed and a little despondent about those votes,\u201d said Kelly Shackelford, president of the First Liberty Institute \u2013 a group dedicated to defending religious liberty. Supreme Court conservatives want to topple abortion rights -- but can't seem to agree on how \u201cBut I think they are reading way too much into what evidence we have so far,\u201d he said, noting that the votes came in emergency applications and cert petitions, and not in published opinions. \u201cInstead, we have to wait on significant opinions before we can tell where she is.\u201d A separate source with close ties to religious liberty groups said that he had had a similar conversation with \u201cmore than a handful of people.\u201d \u201cThere is concern and worry,\u201d the source said, going as far as to call Barrett \u201ctimid,\u201d but acknowledging a \u201c\u2018wait and see\u2019 component.\u201d The source expressed concern that the court would end up in a 3-3-3 lineup in some cases with the liberals on one side, and Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Barrett in the middle and Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas on the far right. Trump\u2019s most lasting legacy will be his judicial nominations, and conservatives are impatient to see how the more than 200 judges \u2013 including three justices \u2013 he nominated to the federal bench will reshape the country. Supreme Court to discuss case that could expand Second Amendment rights Worries among supporters for judicial nominees or disdain for rulings that overshadow their overall record is nothing new for advocates. Roberts, for instance, has expanded 2nd Amendment rights, gutted the Voting Rights Act and has voted against same-sex marriage, but also saved Obamacare. Last term, many conservative allies were stunned by an opinion penned by Trump nominee Gorsuch that went in favor of LGBTQ workers, although Gorsuch has cast other votes in their favor, particularly on the issue of religious freedom. They are hoping that Barrett will not surprise them in the big cases, and instead, solidify the court\u2019s rightward tilt, fulfilling Trump\u2019s promise to change the direction of the court. The worst-case scenario for conservatives, of course, is that she would eventually be like Justice David Souter, the George H.W. Bush nominee who eventually joined the liberal wing. But there is nothing in Barrett\u2019s record to indicate that would happen. The perception of Barrett could change instantly however with a couple of key cases. The justices have heard oral arguments in a case that could determine the future of Obamacare, as well as a significant religious liberty dispute out of Philadelphia. Also pending is a petition concerning a Mississippi 15-week abortion ban that would be a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade. It takes four justices to agree to hear a case, and it would be a major signal of Barrett\u2019s intentions if she indicates publicly her stance. In addition, on Friday the court is considering whether to take up a case next term concerning the scope of the Second Amendment \u2013 an issue the justices have so far declined to revisit over the past decade. Next term could also bring cases on affirmative action and voting rights. A Republican who worked on Barrett\u2019s nomination on the Hill said he hasn\u2019t heard of similar concerns among the GOP senators who were deeply satisfied with her performance during her confirmation hearings and believed by the end of the term, Barrett would vote solidly for the right side of the bench. Despite any hand-wringing or nervousness, Barrett\u2019s impact has already been felt on the court\u2019s strong 6-3 conservative majority. On the bench, Barrett voted in her first abortion-related case granting the Trump administration\u2019s request to reinstate long-standing restrictions for patients seeking to obtain a drug used for abortions early in pregnancy, over the dissent of the three liberals. It was Barrett who cast a key vote in a November case challenging Covid restrictions put in place by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, limiting the number of people attending religious services. Barrett sided with the conservatives in favor of the houses of worship, while Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberals in dissent. The vote was notable because before the death of Ginsburg, the court split 5-4 on similar cases out California and Nevada ruling in favor of the states. The majority flipped with the addition of Barrett. EXCLUSIVE: Anger, leaks and tensions at the Supreme Court during the LGBTQ rights case Those who wanted the court to weigh in on the 2020 election, however, were disappointed as the court sent a strong signal it had no interest getting involved with election results, despite an enormous amount of pressure from Trump. The former President has many times expressed bitter disappointment with the court for failing to rule in his favor to overturn election results, most recently in a Fox News interview last week. Supreme Court denies election appeal from Pennsylvania Republicans Barrett did not take part in an order on October 28 \u2013 two days after her confirmation \u2013 when the Supreme Court denied a request from Pennsylvania Republicans to accelerate review of a lower court decision that allowed ballots to be counted up to three days after Election Day. The court\u2019s public information officer said at the time that Barrett did not participate because of the need for a \u201cprompt resolution\u201d and because she had not had time to fully review the filings. The move was not out of the ordinary for a new justice. But still, it came as Alito, joined by Gorsuch and Thomas, wrote a fiery statement saying that while they \u201creluctantly concluded\u201d there was not enough time at this \u201clate date\u201d to decide the case before the election, they were troubled. \u201cThere is a strong likelihood that the State Supreme Court decision violates the Federal Constitution,\u201d Alito wrote. When the case came up again on February 22 the court denied an appeal from Republicans to take up the case. Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas again dissented. \u201cNow, the election is over, and there is no reason for refusing to decide the important question that these cases pose,\u201d Alito said. It would have taken four justices to take up the case, and there were only three. Barrett, among others, did not raise her hand. In December, the court also rejected a bid by Texas to overturn the election results in battleground states. In a brief order the court said that Texas did not have the legal right \u2013 known as \u201cstanding\u201d \u2013 to bring the challenge. No full dissents were noted although Alito and Thomas disagreed on a procedural point in a statement. The election-related votes were in contrast to comments Trump made before the election in which he suggested the justices might end up deciding it. Back then Trump said it would be \u201cimportant to have nine justices.\u201d On another front, eyebrows were raised in early February when a fractured court voted to block California\u2019s Covid-related ban on indoor worship services. Barrett sided with the majority. But she and Kavanuagh did allow other limitations to remain in place. Penning her first concurring opinion, Barrett didn\u2019t go as far as the churches would have liked and voted to allow California\u2019s prohibition on singing and chanting during indoor services to remain. Supreme Court conservatives poised to uphold Arizona's curbs on voting \u201cAs the case comes to us,\u201d she wrote, \u201cit remains unclear whether the singing ban applies across the board (and thus constitutes a neutral and generally applicable law) or else favors certain sectors (and thus triggers more searching review).\u201d Barrett did not sign on to a statement from Gorsuch, Thomas and Alito who pointed to some confusion and a record that suggested that the music, film and television studios are permitted to sing indoors. \u201cEven if a full congregation singing hymns is too risky, California does not explain why even a single masked cantor cannot lead worship behind a mask and a plexiglass shield,\u201d Gorsuch said. Five months in, as is the custom, Barrett has only released one majority opinion in a case concerning the Freedom of Information Act. Because she is the junior-most justice, it\u2019s unlikely this term or next that she would be assigned a blockbuster opinion.",

            "article_content": "Karen Carter Peterson wants to make history. The longtime Louisiana state senator is vying for the open seat once held by Cedric Richmond \u2013 one that would propel her to become the first Black woman to represent the state in Congress. \u201cWhen women are not at the table and seated, we are typically on the menu,\u201d Peterson, 51, told CNN in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t like that we\u2019ve never had an African American woman serve from Louisiana in our congressional delegation. That needs to end.\u201d Peterson is one of 15 candidates running to succeed Richmond in the 2nd Congressional District, a solidly blue seat that represents an area stretching from inland Baton Rouge to waterside New Orleans and snaking through the River Parishes. Richmond, who was easily reelected in November, was tapped by President Joe Biden to join the White House as senior adviser and director of the Office of Public Engagement. Early voting started March 6 in the special election and the final day to cast a ballot is Saturday. If no candidate wins a majority, the top two vote-getters advance to a runoff next month. Peterson faces steep competition from state Sen. Troy Carter, who has the support of Richmond and is her closet rival in fundraising, and activist Gary Chambers. Peterson and Carter have faced off for this seat before; both ran for it but lost in 2006. Peterson\u2019s campaign comes as the political power of Black women has reached a zenith, with Kamala Harris becoming the first Black and South Asian vice president, and as Black women seek to use their collective power to fill state legislatures, governorships and congressional seats with their own. That burgeoning organizing and fundraising apparatus backed by Black women has lined up behind Peterson, with a litany of key endorsements, including the influential quartet of seasoned Black women political operatives \u2013 Donna Brazile, Minyon Moore, Leah Daughtry and Yolanda Caraway. Black women groups like Higher Heights for America PAC and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams have also gotten behind Peterson. \u201cI\u2019m really careful about endorsements, and I have friends that I love, and I\u2019ve got to make different decisions for, but Karen has been in the trenches with me for more than a decade. She has fought with me for more than a decade. She has believed in the power of our people, and she puts her money and her heart where her mouth is,\u201d Abrams said in a video sharing her endorsement for Peterson. \u201cShe is yet another example of the multiple pipelines that groups like Higher Heights and Black woman organizers have been designing over the last, frankly, decade to two decades,\u201d Glynda Carr, president and CEO of Higher Heights, said in an interview. Carr described Harris\u2019 trajectory as a \u201cpipeline blueprint\u201d \u2013 one that would \u201caccelerate our work,\u201d adding that that\u2019s something Peterson\u2019s own ascension would do. Peterson also garnered support from Our Revolution, a Bernie Sanders-backed group, and Emily\u2019s List, the political action committee that backs women who favor abortion rights. \u201cHere is a woman who has been serving her state legislature in the deep South, unapologetically progressive and also has shattered firsts in her own right,\u201d Carr said. One of Peterson\u2019s key opponents, Carter, has broken his own barriers \u2013 and has the support of Democrats in Washington, including Richmond himself. A longtime Democratic politician, Carter is a familiar face to voters in the area. He was the first African American elected to the Louisiana House of Representatives in 1991. He was then elected to the New Orleans City council in 1994. And in 2015, he was elected the first African American senator for Louisiana\u2019s state District 7, according to his biography. Notably, Carter has been endorsed by Richmond, who first took office in 2011, as well as House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, Reps. Hakeem Jeffries, Joyce Beatty \u2013 the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus \u2013 and Ro Khanna \u2013 a reflection of the Washington influence on the solidly Democratic seat. Carter touts Richmond\u2019s endorsement frequently. His name is listed first on Carter\u2019s campaign website endorsement page, his face has appeared on mailers, and Richmond even cut an ad for Carter posted in mid-January to his Facebook (the ad now appears to have been removed). Khanna told CNN that his endorsement of Carter came as the result of an organic working relationship with Richmond. \u201cCedric came to me when he was leaving and he said look, you\u2019ll really like this guy Troy, and he, I think, will work with you to build on the work we\u2019ve been doing on building bridges,\u201d Khanna told CNN. \u201cI spoke to him and I was impressed by him. He talked about his wanting to build with the Progressive Caucus.\u201d Clyburn also told CNN that he first met Carter during his work as the congressional liaison for Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and when Carter asked for his endorsement recently, he obliged. Clyburn said no one other than Carter asked for his backing. Policy-wise, Carter supports raising the minimum wage, abortion rights and Medicare for All, his campaign says, but not the Green New Deal, a de-facto progressive litmus test. In campaign materials, he has touted support from local Republicans, and, in an interview with CNN, he emphasized the importance of working across the aisle. \u201cIn this business, relationships matter. Having the ability to work with people, having the ability to get along, having the ability to build alliances along, above or beyond the imaginary line of Republican and Democrat, but to be able to cross those aisles that\u2019s imaginary,\u201d Carter said. Peterson\u2019s allies say Richmond\u2019s presence looms large around the district. \u201cI would say he\u2019s a heavy influence, not because of what he\u2019s physically doing, but simply because he\u2019s putting his endorsement out there,\u201d said state Rep. Candace Newell. \u201d And other people are attaching the names together.\u201d Carter frames Richmond\u2019s support as an immense advantage. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just a friendship, it\u2019s based on a record of accomplishment,\u201d Carter told CNN. He said Richmond\u2019s endorsement sends the message, \u201chere\u2019s someone that I\u2019m telling you, as a senior adviser to the President, I\u2019m very comfortable working with. Therefore, he will have access to the White House, to the President, to resources, perhaps above and beyond what a freshman member might otherwise have.\u201d Carter\u2019s campaign committee outraised Peterson\u2019s by tens of thousands of dollars, according to Federal Election Commission filings filed March 1. Carter reported raising  $519,000 compared to Peterson\u2019s $450,000. The White House did not respond for comment. Chambers, another key candidate in the race, did not respond to a request comment. The first time Peterson saw her name on the ballot, she was 18 and running to be a delegate for presidential candidate Jesse Jackson at the 1988 Democratic National Convention in Atlanta. Eleven years later, she bested seven opponents to win a state House seat in a runoff. The second Black woman to hold the seat, she\u2019s been in the legislature for the last 21 years, and in her current seat since January 2010. She later became the first woman to chair the Louisiana Democratic Party and a vice chair of civic engagement and voter participation of the Democratic National Committee. Born and raised in New Orleans, Peterson said her dad raised her and her sisters to be \u201cindependent thinkers.\u201d That prompted her to eventually attend her hometown law school at Tulane University with a goal of helping people, after obtaining her bachelor\u2019s degree from Howard University, the famed \u201cMecca\u201d of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. \u201cFundamentally, that\u2019s why I ran for office,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid to stand in the cut, shake things up when it needs to be shaken up and get things done.\u201d As a deep south Democrat, Peterson touts her progressive laurels. She\u2019s endorsed Medicare for All and the sweeping Green New Deal, and hopes to join the Progressive Caucus if elected. Of her most cherished accomplishments, she heralded her efforts to expand Medicaid in 2016. Peterson drew national attention and Republican pushback in 2013, after she said opposition to Obamacare in her state boiled down to racism. And no stranger to confrontation, Peterson has bucked her own party\u2019s leadership during her time in office, calling out Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards over his anti-abortion stance. Peterson supporters, like Newell, acknowledged the high scrutiny Black women face when running for or holding office. Peterson, she said, is no different. \u201cHer ability to continue to stand in and fight,\u201d Newell said. \u201cI\u2019m taking notes. Because as a woman, and as a Black woman, you\u2019re going to get attacked a little bit more harshly than the males that you work alongside.\u201d",

            "article_content": "US intelligence agencies believe that \u201cnarratives of fraud in the recent general election\u201d and \u201cthe emboldening impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol\u201d will \u201calmost certainly\u201d spur domestic extremists to try to engage in additional acts of violence this year, according to the unclassified summary of a new joint assessment released Wednesday. That warning was included in a comprehensive classified assessment of domestic violent extremism produced by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, which was ordered by the White House in January. READ: Summary of joint assessment of domestic violent extremism threat The full report was transmitted to the White House and Congress. The summary was released on the same day that DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told lawmakers domestic violent extremism is the \u201cgreatest threat\u201d to the US \u2013 a clear reminder that federal officials remain very concerned about the potential for more violence in the coming months. \u201cNewer sociopolitical developments \u2013 such as narratives of fraud in the recent general election, the emboldening impact of the violent breach of the US Capitol, conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and conspiracy theories promoting violence \u2013 will almost certainly spur some (domestic violent extremists) to try to engage in violence this year,\u201d the unclassified summary says. The assessment breaks down domestic extremists into several categories, including racially or ethnically motivated extremists, animal rights and environmental extremists, abortion-related and anti-government extremists. The \u201cmost lethal\u201d domestic extremist threats come from \u201cracially or ethnically motivated violent extremists\u201d and \u201cmilitia\u201d extremists, it adds. Racially motivated extremists are most likely to conduct mass casualty attacks against civilians, the assessment finds, while militia extremists typically target law enforcement and government personnel and facilities. The militia threat \u201cwill almost certainly continue to be elevated throughout 2021\u201d because of sociopolitical factors, the assessment notes. A Senate aide familiar with the report\u2019s findings told CNN that it highlights the challenges of dealing with so-called lone wolf extremists \u2013 individuals with loose associations following ideologies of hate and extremism who Mayorkas said Wednesday are \u201cwilling and able to take those ideologies and execute on them in unlawful, illegal, violent ways.\u201d Lone offenders or small cells of domestic violent extremists are \u201cmore likely to carry out violent attacks\u201d in the US than organizations, the summary says. Attackers often \u201cradicalize independently by consuming violent extremist material online and mobilize without direction from a violent extremist organization, making detection and disruption difficult,\u201d it says. White supremacist extremists have the most \u201cconcerning\u201d connections outside of the US, because of like-minded views in other countries, the report finds. A \u201csmall number of US (racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists) have traveled abroad to network with like-minded individuals,\u201d the summary says. The full classified assessment was prepared in response to President Joe Biden\u2019s request for a comprehensive threat assessment of domestic violent extremism, an ODNI official told CNN, adding that the intelligence community was tasked to draw on analysis from across the government and, as appropriate, nongovernmental organizations. The ODNI official also told CNN that the assessment does not evaluate or address actions of individuals engaged solely in activities protected by the First Amendment or other rights secured by the Constitution. This story has been updated with additional details from the summary of the assessment.",

            "article_content": "Count Dick Durbin among the growing chorus of voices on the liberal left who believe the time has come to jettison the Senate\u2019s legislative filibuster. The Illinois Democrat, who also serves as the Senate Majority Whip \u2013 the No. 2 leadership position in the party \u2013 went very public with his issues with the way the filibuster is being used in the modern Senate during a fiery speech on the floor on Monday. Here\u2019s the key bit: \u201cToday, nearly 65 years after Strom Thurmond\u2019s marathon defense of Jim Crow, the filibuster is still making a mockery of American democracy. The filibuster is still being misused by some Senators to block legislation urgently needed and supported by strong majorities of the American people. This is what hitting legislative rock bottom looks like. Today\u2019s filibusters have turned the world\u2019s most deliberative body into one of the world\u2019s most ineffectual bodies.\u201d \u201cThis is what hitting legislative rock bottom looks like!\u201d Durbin made clear that he is open to reforming the filibuster rather than getting rid of it entirely \u2013 proposing that if a senator wants to block a vote on a piece of legislation, he or she should be required to hold the Senate floor for as long as they possibly can. Which is what most average Americans believe how the filibuster works right now! (Most peoples\u2019 conception of the filibuster comes from \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington,\u201d if we\u2019re being honest.) But that\u2019s not actually how the filibuster works in the modern version of the Senate. These days a single senator can keep the Senate from trying to invoke cloture \u2013 a fancy word that simply means ending the Senate\u2019s unlimited debate and proceed to a final vote \u2013 with simply the threat of a filibuster. As in, a senator can simply indicate that he or she would filibuster a certain piece of legislation in order for it to gum up the works. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! As The Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump wrote in January: \u201cIn practical terms, filibusters these days are only rarely hours-long riffs driven by passion for a cause. They are much more frequently hand-wavey threats to offer such a speech, with the end game of forcing legislation to meet a supermajority standard before passage.\u201d The filibuster has been eroded in the past decade \u2013 first by Democrats under Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, who opened Pandora\u2019s box in 2013 when he invoked what was then known as the \u201cnuclear option\u201d \u2013 eliminating the need for 60 votes to end debate on all presidential nominations other than Supreme Court justices. On those nominations, a simple majority was all that was needed to proceed to a final confirmation vote, transforming the Senate, at least in part, into a majority rules body similar yo the House. When Republicans retook the Senate majority in 2016, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell showed that what\u2019s good for the goose is good for the gander, further undermining the filibuster by including Supreme Court nominees in Reid\u2019s previous changes. That move, which meant that a simple majority of senators could end a filibuster, allowed McConnell to confirm three Supreme Court Justices in President Donald Trump\u2019s four-year term: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. Which brings us to this moment, with Democrats, again, in the majority and with a Democrat in the White House in the form of Joe Biden. Liberals, having watched Trump (and McConnell) fundamentally alter the ideological makeup of the most powerful court in the country for a generation, want Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) to move to get rid of the filibuster entirely \u2013 including on legislative matters. \u201cPreserving the filibuster is not worth letting millions of people in this country go hungry, sleep in their cars, or struggle to afford baby formula,\u201d tweeted New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez last month. The problem? Democrats don\u2019t have the votes, at least not yet. In order to change the Senate rules, they need all 50 Democrats to back such a move. And at least two Democrats \u2013 Sens. Joe Manchin (West Virginia) and Kyrsten Sinema (Arizona) \u2013 have said they don\u2019t support the elimination of the filibuster. Manchin said back in July 2020 that eliminating was the filibuster was \u201cbullshit\u201d and he continues to insist that he opposes such a move. However, in an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d earlier this month, Manchin seemed open to what Durbin backed in his speech: Forcing a senator to hold the Senate floor for as long as he or she possibly can. \u201cIf you want to make it a little bit more painful, make him stand there and talk,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cI\u2019m willing to look at any way we can, but I\u2019m not willing to take away the involvement of the minority.\u201d And here\u2019s the latest statement from Sinema on the issue: \u201cRetaining the legislative filibuster is not meant to impede the things we want to get done. Rather, it\u2019s meant to protect what the Senate was designed to be: a place where senators come together, find compromise and get things done for our country.\u201d In addition, Biden, himself a long-serving senator before winning the White House, has voiced opposition to elimination of the filibuster. \u201cThe President\u2019s preference is not to get rid of the filibuster,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said earlier this month. \u201cHis preference is not to make different changes to the rules, to the filibuster rules.\u201d Despite that opposition, there\u2019s no question that pressure is building on the likes of Manchin, Sinema and even Biden to reconsider their views on the filibuster. Why? Because, with a Democratic-controlled House, a Democratic President and a Democrats in control of the Senate \u2013 admittedly solely because Vice President Kamala Harris breaks 50-50 ties \u2013 many liberals view these next two years as a unique moment to push long-hoped-for legislation. That includes gun control legislation, which has already passed the House, aggressive efforts to slow climate change and policy proposals designed to counter Republicans efforts at the state level to limit voting rights. The House has already passed HR1, which would usher in a series of election and voting reforms.) \u201cThere\u2019s no way under the sun that in 2021 that we are going to allow the filibuster to be used to deny voting rights,\u201d said South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the number three ranking Democrat in the House and its most powerful African American member. \u201cThat just ain\u2019t gonna happen. That would be catastrophic.\u201d Durbin\u2019s vociferous argument in favor of changing (or ending) the filibuster will further amp up attention on the issue. Will it change the minds it needs to? That\u2019s the big question. For his part, McConnell strongly warned Democrats that Republicans will grind the Senate to a halt if the filibuster rules get changed. On Tuesday, McConnell laid out a conservative agenda that Republicans would push the next time they take control of Congress and White House, most of which Democrats would vehemently oppose \u2013 like defunding Planned Parenthood and adding sweeping restrictions against abortion. The pendulum would swing both ways, \u201cand it would swing hard,\u201d he warned. CNN\u2019s Ali Zaslav contributed to this analysis.",

            "article_content": "The schedule for this week\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference is yet more evidence that much of the conservative movement remains deeply committed to the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from President Donald Trump. That lie continues to be a widespread belief among Republican voters. It continues to be endorsed or at least humored by some Republican candidates seeking the support of those voters in party primaries. It is fueling Republican state legislators\u2019 attempts to impose hurdles to voting. And the CPAC agenda suggests it is about to be given another big public push at one of the most prominent gatherings on the conservative calendar \u2013 which will feature not only speeches from Trump and son Donald Trump Jr. but seven separate panels or addresses under the title \u201cprotecting elections.\u201d These have not been set up as benign, educational discussions among experts. Rather, the sessions in Orlando appear designed to allow right-wing partisans to promote some of the same complaints Trump made in the highly dishonest January 6 rally speech that immediately preceded a mob of his supporters\u2019 attack on the Capitol. One of the seven discussion subtitles is \u201cFailed States (PA, GA, NV, oh my!)\u201d (Those states held free and fair elections that happened to be won by Joe Biden.) Another subtitle is \u201cOther Culprits: Why Judges & Media Refused to Look at the Evidence.\u201d (As journalists and judges have noted, there is no good evidence of widespread voter fraud or election malfeasance in 2020.) A third subtitle is \u201cThey Told Ya So: The Signs Were Always There.\u201d (This panel features lawyer Hans von Spakovsky, who, in fact, has previously said false things about voter fraud.) A fourth subtitle: \u201cThe Left Pulled the Strings, Covered It Up, and Even Admits It.\u201d (We\u2019re not yet sure exactly what this means, but there was no left-wing election conspiracy.) The speakers on the \u201cprotecting elections\u201d panels include Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks and Tea Party Patriots co-founder Jenny Beth Martin, both of whom, in the weeks leading up to the Capitol attack, echoed the lie that the election was stolen; Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Kelly, who has uttered baseless fraud claims and unsuccessfully tried to get Pennsylvania\u2019s results invalidated in court; and Cleta Mitchell, a lawyer who joined Trump on the January 2 phone call during which Trump asked Georgia\u2019s top elections official to \u201cfind\u201d him enough votes to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in the state. CPAC has long featured a hodgepodge of speakers, from anti-abortion activists to anti-tax activists to conservative celebrities. Since Trump took office in 2017, though, it has highlighted distinctly Trumpian themes and voices. This year\u2019s agenda \u2013 which also includes discussions on some of Trump\u2019s favorite campaign subjects, from \u201cBig Tech\u201d to \u201cThe Angry Mob and Violence in our Streets\u201d \u2013 is a testament to the former president\u2019s grip on the party even after he was voted out of office. It helps him, of course, that much of the party doesn\u2019t believe he was truly voted out of office. And CPAC seems to be trying its best to cement the conspiracy myth into party orthodoxy. The American Conservative Union, the organization behind CPAC, did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. On Monday night, though, American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp went on CNN and perpetuated false election claims himself \u2013 inaccurately saying, among other things, that \u201cthere was widespread voter fraud in the last election.\u201d And why wouldn\u2019t he? In the Republican culture of early 2021, you get penalized for standing up against big lies, not for repeating them.",

            "article_content": "South Carolina on Thursday became the first state in 2021 to enact a restrictive abortion law known as a \u201cheartbeat ban,\u201d an opening salvo underscoring a potentially perilous situation for President Joe Biden\u2019s administration as anti-abortion supporters look for a Supreme Court fight over reproductive rights. The high court, which shifted in a more conservative direction under former President Donald Trump, has recently signaled a willingness to support certain abortion restrictions. The justices could soon consider cases threatening Roe v. Wade, the landmark high court case legalizing abortion nationwide. Experts and advocates on both sides of the aisle suggest that Biden\u2019s recourse is largely limited to backing federal abortion legislation, appointing federal judges supportive of abortion rights and vocally endorsing abortion access. South Carolina\u2019s heartbeat law \u2013 SB1, the first of the session \u2013 bans abortions at the detection of a fetal heartbeat, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy and before many people know they are pregnant. It includes exceptions for instances of rape, incest \u2013 both of which physicians must report to the county sheriff within 24 hours \u2013 medical emergencies, and fetal anomalies. It also requires abortion providers to perform an ultrasound and display the image to the pregnant individual, and to \u201cask the woman if she would like to hear the heartbeat\u201d if audible \u2013 a medically unnecessary requirement that the Supreme Court has previously allowed to take effect in other states. In many ways, the South Carolina measure could preview court battles potentially awaiting the Biden administration. With one lawsuit already filed seeking to block the new law, the impending legal fight exposes what limited options the administration has to oppose state level restrictions that could threaten Roe. CNN has repeatedly reached out to the Biden administration for comment on the South Carolina bill and its potential avenues for combating such legislation. Compared to those in 2019, newer heartbeat bans such as South Carolina\u2019s mark \u201csort of a normalization of what would have once seemed to be kind of extreme antiabortion strategies,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University and the author of \u201cAbortion and the Law in America: Roe v. Wade to the Present.\u201d They serve \u201cnot just as a strategy to get to a conservative Supreme Court, but maybe also possibly a preview of what conservative lawmakers would do if Roe v. Wade is gone,\u201d she added. Passing a federal abortion law is an option for federal Democrats, but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t seem to be a priority,\u201d Ziegler added, noting that \u201cwould be difficult because (of) the slim majority that the Democrats have in the Senate, and it would also be difficult because there are a lot of competing priorities for Congress right now, given the pandemic and the state of the economy and lots of other things.\u201d One such bill is the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act of 2019, which would create a standard for abortion access including the right to a pre-viability abortion \u2014 a provision that would counteract heartbeat laws like South Carolina\u2019s \u2014 and has gained dozens of co-sponsors in the House and Senate. \u201cThat is legislation that we are hoping and calling on the Biden administration to champion,\u201d said Jackie Blank, a federal legislative strategist for the Center for Reproductive Rights, adding that \u201cthis really is an area for Congress to intervene\u201d with pro-active guidelines as opposed to efforts to combat abortion restrictions through litigation. In terms of getting actively involved in a case before the Supreme Court that could threaten Roe, the attorney general could instruct the solicitor general to file a court brief in support of the abortion rights supporters bringing the case, or the solicitor general could be invited to present the administration\u2019s position at oral arguments, said Steven Aden, chief legal officer and general counsel at the anti-abortion group Americans United for Life. \u201cThere really are few options in the constitutional system for the President and his administration to force their position on this issue,\u201d Aden said. Some Democrats, furious over Senate Republicans\u2019 decision to seat Trump\u2019s third conservative Supreme Court justice, Amy Coney Barrett, so close to the November election, have floated the idea of court expansion \u2014 adding more seats to the nine-member bench to offset current conservative dominance. Biden told CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes in October that if elected, he would form a bipartisan commission to recommend changes to the Supreme Court, noting that \u201cit\u2019s not about court packing.\u201d Moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has already said he would not support expanding the Supreme Court, dampening such hopes of countering the court\u2019s conservative tilt. Regardless of Senate logistics, there may not be support for court packing as a means to protect Roe until the precedent has already been overturned \u2013 a dynamic the justices may take into account in considering such bills, Ziegler said. Should the court overturn Roe, \u201cthe Democrats would totally have the willingness to pack the court because there would be a backlash \u2014 lots of voters would be upset, people would be angry at the Supreme Court and it would put abortion at the top of the agenda,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s not lost on the Supreme Court\u2019s conservatives either. So I think the threat of court packing is not likely to be one that\u2019s realized, but it is one that probably hangs pretty heavily over the Supreme court and may actually shape what they\u2019re doing.\u201d Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List, said that the administration is \u201conly a factor into the extent that they are going to continue to fight to end the filibuster and pack the Supreme Court,\u201d or to act on then-candidate Kamala Harris\u2019 promise during the campaign to require Department of Justice approval for state abortion restrictions. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see this President or even Kamala Harris in the thick of their campaign, making this a priority,\u201d Dannenfelser said of the administration\u2019s stance on abortion. \u201cSo I\u2019m not saying they\u2019re not going to follow through on it. They\u2019re just not loud and proud on it. And they\u2019re not, and it\u2019s not to the level of the other pieces of legislation that they really want to pass.\u201d Biden signed a presidential memorandum last month reversing the so-called Mexico City Policy, a ban on US government funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, and directing the Health and Human Services Department to immediately move to consider rescinding the Trump administration rule blocking health care providers in the federally funded Title X family planning program from referring patients for abortions. But his promises during the campaign and since have extended further, to codifying Roe and directing the Justice Department \u201cdo everything in its power to stop\u201d such abortion restrictions. And many abortion rights advocates have called on the Biden administration to go farther in its efforts to date protecting reproductive rights, demanding the repeal of the Hyde Amendment \u2013 which bars federal funding from covering abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman\u2019s life is at risk \u2013 and requirements surrounding medication abortion drugs that were recently reinstated by the Supreme Court. The Biden administration could still work to stop state levels bans before the Supreme Court, since many abortion bills do not make it to the justices but are decided by federal judges, Ziegler said. \u201cI think the Biden administration is going to be doing its level best to shape who trial judges are, what kinds of priorities they have and who on the circuit courts of appeal, which are often the last stop for abortion legislation,\u201d she said. Of the nine so-called gestational bans \u2013 which bar abortions past a certain point in pregnancy \u2013 passed in 2019, none have gone into effect after most of them have been blocked by judges. South Carolina\u2019s bill has already elicited a similar response to its predecessors from abortion rights advocates. Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights challenged the bill on behalf of several South Carolina abortion providers on Thursday after the House passed it but before the governor signed it, asking a federal judge to block the law. Planned Parenthood President and CEO Alexis McGill Johnson told CNN prior to the lawsuit that despite support from federal partners, \u201cabortion access is going to face its greatest threats in the states,\u201d urging the Biden administration to make concrete steps on the Hyde Amendment, medication abortion requirements and federal abortion legislation, but also take a vocal stance on the issue overall. \u201cTo the extent the administration leans into using the bully pulpit to essentially locate abortion in health care where it should be, and putting a stop to it being a bargaining chip in negotiation, I think that actually does more for helping us engage in legislative fights on the state level, as well as the federal level,\u201d McGill Johnson said. This overarching state of play is not lost on advocates in the Palmetto State. South Carolina Rep. John McCravy, a Republican who sponsored the bill in the House and first introduced it last year before Covid hit, cited what Biden has already done on abortion as a motivator to advance the bill. \u201cI think you see outrage in my area that, that we\u2019ve gone from moderate to \u2014 which we don\u2019t agree with \u2014 to absolute leftist abortion at any cost, anywhere, anytime,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so this has really inflamed the masses, I think they now see their eyes have been opened as to what this administration is trying to do. And it makes it all the more urgent for us to push back on that.\u201d Ann Warner \u2013 chief executive officer of the Women\u2019s Rights and Empowerment Network in South Carolina, which has campaigned against the measure \u2013 accused many of the proponents of this bill of being willing to \u201cput not only people\u2019s lives on the line, but also just spend resources that we don\u2019t have, and can\u2019t afford to spend defending an unconstitutional bill like this.\u201d \u201cWe are seeing certainly an administration that is much more in favor of reproductive rights, reproductive justice, reproductive freedom at the national level,\u201d she said. \u201cBut here in South Carolina and in some other southern states we\u2019re seeing a real pushback to that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Being nominated to serve in a presidential Cabinet is, obviously, a huge honor. It\u2019s also been decidedly perilous in recent years. Dating all the way back to Bill Clinton\u2019s first term, at least one Cabinet pick has flopped \u2013 either dropping out after a scandalous news story breaks or failing to gather the needed support among senators to be confirmed. (Zoe Baird! Tom Daschle! Andy Puzder!) Not so \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 for President Joe Biden\u2019s Cabinet picks. At present, 7 of the 23 Cabinet-level nominees Biden has put forward have been confirmed by the Senate \u2013 including his secretaries of State, Defense, Treasury and Homeland Security. And what\u2019s as fascinating is that even some of the picks that appeared headed for rough seas now look likely to get confirmed. Take Neera Tanden, Biden\u2019s pick to run the Office of Management and Budget. Tanden\u2019s nomination was met with widespread skepticism due, at least in part, to her long history of tweets attacking senators by name. Her nomination appeared even more imperiled when Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vermont), who had been on the receiving end of lots of Tanden\u2019s barbs, ascended to the chairmanship of the Budget Committee \u2013 which is charged with holding her confirmation hearing. And yet, while Tanden\u2019s hearings over the past few days haven\u2019t been easy on her, she appears to have expressed enough regret about her past actions to satisfy Sanders and guarantee she gets out of committee and onto the floor for a full Senate vote. With Democrats in control of the Senate, that virtually guarantees she is confirmed. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! (It\u2019s worth noting here that Senate Democrats\u2019 2013 decision to change the rules to allow presidential appointees to be confirmed by a simple majority has radically changed the calculus of who presidents pick and why. It\u2019s also made nominees\u2019 chances of confirmation far higher if their party controls the Senate.) With Tanden possibly having run the confirmation gauntlet, there isn\u2019t now an obvious Biden nominee who will join the ignominious list I mentioned above. Which is a remarkable turnaround from Axios reporting just after the 2020 election that suggested some Democrats were advising Biden to pick a \u201csacrificial lamb\u201d nominee to a) hand Republicans a win and b) ensure safe passage of his other nominees. (Sidebar: This was always a terrible idea, as I wrote at the time.) The last of the most high-profile Cabinet appointees yet to be confirmed is Merrick Garland as attorney general. Earlier this week, the Senate Judiciary Committee announced that it would hold Garland\u2019s confirmation hearing February 22 and 23 with a committee vote on the nomination set for March 1. While Garland\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court back in 2016 was blocked by then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, there has been very little indication that Garland will have any major problems in winning confirmation to the AG post \u2013 especially with Democrats now in control of the Senate. Republicans have, according to a recent Los Angeles Times story, turned their attention instead to Xavier Becerra, Biden\u2019s nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services. (Becerra previously served as the attorney general of California and held a seat in the US House.) Wrote Evan Halper: \u201cThe GOP is fixated on rejecting President Biden\u2019s pick to helm the Department of Health and Human Services, but not for the type of personal failings that typically doom early nominees. It is Becerra\u2019s perceived political and policy sins that are fueling the bid to block him. His California credentials aren\u2019t helping in a Senate where Republicans have no shortage of hostility toward the state, particularly after Becerra led the filing of more than 100 lawsuits against the Trump administration. \u201cMinority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) recently ripped into the nominee on the Senate floor, calling Becerra a \u2018famously partisan\u2019 abortion advocate who is unqualified for the job. Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford called Becerra\u2019s policy pursuits \u2018bizarre,\u2019 accusing the California attorney general of \u2018encouraging the death of children.\u2019 Sen. John Thune of South Dakota said Becerra is on the \u2018extreme left.\u2019\u201d Becerra\u2019s confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. (The committee is chaired by Washington Sen. Patty Murray.) But for all of Republicans\u2019 bluster about blocking Becerra, it\u2019s important to remember that unless and until a Democratic senator says they will vote against Becerra (or any other Biden Cabinet pick), he would be confirmed by the Democratic majority. The grain of salt in all of this is that we are less than a month into Biden\u2019s presidency. And that there are still nine \u201ccore\u201d Cabinet nominees who remain unconfirmed. But there\u2019s no question that the Cabinet confirmation process has gone smoother than even Biden \u2013 no stranger to Senate confirmation fights \u2013 could have even hoped. So far, at least.",

            "article_content": "On Monday morning, Illinois State House Speaker Mike Madigan made a stunning announcement: He would no longer try to get the 60 votes he needs to be elected to the post he has held almost continually since he first won it in 1983. Madigan represents one of the last vestiges of the old party boss system \u2013 a man not terribly well-known outside of the city of Chicago but someone who, arguably, wields more influence than any other single figure in this massive Midwestern state. In search of answers about how Madigan got here, I talked to Chicago Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson in December about Madigan \u2013 and his future fate. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Explain, briefly the space Mike Madigan has occupied in Chicago Democratic politics for the last several decades. Pearson: Madigan, 78, has been part of the fabric of city and state politics for more than a half century. He was born into the world of ward politics on the Southwest Side in the bungalow belt near Midway Airport where his father was a Democratic precinct captain. He also grew into the political patronage system, holding city jobs while becoming a trusted part of Mayor Richard J. Daley\u2019s machine. In 1969, he was elected the youngest ward boss in the city at the age of 27. That year, Daley also tapped him to become a delegate to the convention that wrote the state\u2019s 1970 Constitution \u2014 its current governing document \u2014 as well as to keep an eye on another delegate, Daley\u2019s son, the future Mayor Richard M. Daley. In 1970, Madigan was elected to the Illinois House, where he has served ever since. While city mayors came and went, Madigan continued to accumulate power and jobs through city and county allies, and in 1983 he became House speaker. He has held that post ever since, with the exception of 1995-1997 when Republicans took brief control of the chamber. The year Madigan first became speaker also was the first year of the \u201cCutback Amendment,\u201d a voter-approved state constitutional amendment which created single-member House districts and reduced the size of the chamber by one-third. The real effect was to concentrate power \u2013 and campaign money \u2013 into the hands of the legislative leaders and Madigan proved to be a master fundraiser. Governors both Republican and Democrat have acknowledged Madigan as the real power in Illinois politics \u2013 through his ability to singularly control the fate of legislation and dictate the vote of his members being key to any politician\u2019s agenda. He would quash measures sought by Chicago mayors until he was able to extract concessions in return or punish them if they weren\u2019t offered. He made the local share of the state income tax temporary so that Mayor Richard M. Daley had to come back to him for help, allowing him to extract more from Daley. Madigan also is a property tax assessment attorney, which has proved to be a lucrative business. In addition to representing major city businesses in appealing property taxes, getting a cut of any reduction, business leaders also know of Madigan\u2019s clout and offer property tax business as recognition. Madigan also has further concentrated his power by holding the position of chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party, a post he was elected to in 1998. But unlike other states\u2019 party organizations which strive to be publicly active and take a role in national affairs, Madigan cared little about national politics \u2013 even before Illinois turned into a reliably Democratic state on the presidential scene. Instead, he used the party as a closed operation to help further his Democratic majorities in areas that had been traditionally Republican \u2013 such as the suburban \u201ccollar counties\u201d which surround Chicago and Cook County. Cillizza: Madigan is the longest-serving state speaker of the House in the country \u2013 in power for all but two years since 1983. How has he managed to last so long amid so many changes within the Democratic Party? Pearson: On the old \u201cStar Trek\u201d series, there was a 3-D chessboard. Consider Madigan to be the political grandmaster. For much of his career, Madigan was able to outmaneuver political adversaries on issues to the point of either sensing the tide on an issue and getting in front of it, waiting his opponents out or helping to defeat them. But Madigan has also lasted because of his ability to change. At one time, citing his Roman Catholic faith, Madigan was opposed to abortion and his ideology could be viewed almost as a Blue Dog centrist-to-conservative Democrat. But with his ability to adapt, Madigan eventually oversaw progressive legislation making Illinois a leader in abortion rights, one of the first states to enact same-sex marriage before the US Supreme Court ruled and the 11th state to legalize recreational adult use of marijuana. Progressive is still not a word used to describe Madigan. Madigan\u2019s primary goal [is] maintaining power and a Democratic legislative majority. Cillizza: Has Madigan ever faced a real threat to his power? When and why? Pearson: Previously, the only threat Madigan faced to his power, aside from the two years when Republicans held the Illinois House, came under Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich and recently defeated one-term Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner. Blagojevich sought to build alliances with then-Democratic Illinois Senate President Emil Jones to try to advance his agenda, though it was widely viewed as damaging to the state\u2019s economy and unaffordable. Blagojevich would tell Jones that no one viewed him as a power or respected him as Senate president because Madigan was widely regarded as the power in Illinois. This created tensions between Madigan and Jones, and Madigan ultimately used the House to kill off most of Blagojevich\u2019s ill-conceived initiatives. Those feelings were beneath the obvious issues that included trying to shake down a children\u2019s hospital and sell a US Senate seat that led to Blagojevich\u2019s eventual impeachment, removal from office and federal conviction. Under Rauner, a wealthy equity investor, Madigan faced his toughest battles. Rauner used his cash to bankroll Republican legislative candidates, using ads calling Madigan \u201ccorrupt\u201d and blaming Madigan for all of the perceived ills that had befallen Illinois. Rauner also backed a pro-business, anti-union agenda that sought to weaken one of Madigan\u2019s greatest sources of financial support \u2014 organized labor. The ideological clash between the two led to Illinois going two years without a state budget with government funded through court orders that far outstripped available cash. Ultimately, Madigan won support from some Republicans for a budget and income tax increase in an attempt to repair the wreckage caused to social service agencies and places like Illinois colleges and universities. Rauner lasted one term and lost to Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker in 2018. Though Rauner has departed the political scene, his heavy spending and daily criticisms of Madigan inflicted serious damage. Once a figure that everyday Illinoisans never knew, Madigan has become viewed as extremely unpopular \u2013 even before the federal investigation in which he has been implicated. Cillizza: Why is this the moment that Madigan appears to be in real trouble in his effort to remain as speaker? Is all his history finally catching up with him? Pearson: Reflecting his ability to adapt, Madigan now finds a caucus with a large contingent of women members. But in 2018, cracks developed in support for Madigan amid the #MeToo movement when he faced issues regarding sexual harassment in both his political and governmental operation. He discarded veteran political operatives including his longtime chief of staff, appointed more women to senior posts and promised to do more to prevent any recurrences. But frustration with Madigan has been building with a younger, more progressive caucus straining under an autocratic style which lets members advance only a few of their bills per session. Then in July, Commonwealth Edison, the state\u2019s largest electrical utility, agreed to pay a $200 million fine and cooperate with federal prosecutors in acknowledging its part of a near decade-long bribery and influence scheme, seeking to win Madigan\u2019s favor on legislation by giving jobs and contracts to Madigan\u2019s top allies. On Wednesday, the former CEO of ComEd and once one of the city\u2019s most powerful businesswomen, Anne Pramaggiore, two other utility players and Madigan\u2019s top private sector confidant, lobbyist and former lawmaker Michael McClain, pleaded not guilty to charges associated with the scheme. Rank-and-file Democratic lawmakers and candidates in the November 3 election said that as they tried to explain their positions on issues, voters repeatedly said their chief interest was what were they going to do about Madigan. Distrust of Madigan was also cited as a factor in the defeat of the governor\u2019s signature agenda item, a proposed state constitutional amendment to change Illinois from a flat-rate income tax to a graduated-rate tax that rises with income, a system similar to the federal government and used by more than 30 states. Opponents, largely funded by business interests, continually raised the question of \u201cdo you trust politicians with more tax money?\u201d The amendment was rejected overwhelmingly by voters in a hugely expensive campaign. Pritzker contends the amendment\u2019s loss is in part due to Madigan and has said he should consider stepping down. US Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber\u2019s leadership, also said the party paid a heavy price for Madigan\u2019s leadership after his favored local congressional candidate, Betsy Dirksen Londrigan of Springfield, was defeated by four-term US Rep. Rodney Davis of Taylorville. Davis tarred Londrigan with ads associating her with Madigan. Madigan had always been viewed on the outside as smart enough to avoid being caught in the city and state\u2019s history of corruption. He has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He doesn\u2019t have a cell phone or use email. He said he retains sizable support in his caucus and will seek reelection as speaker and doesn\u2019t intend to step down. But in politics, perception caries a great deal of weight and the public perception of Madigan is now being joined by at least 19 members of his expected 73-member majority in the new General Assembly that convenes in January. Rather than a leader, the dissidents consider him a hindrance and a distraction. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cIn January the next Speaker of the Illinois state House will be ________.\u201d Now, explain. Pearson: I don\u2019t mean to weasel out here but this is very much an open question. In the past, there were heirs apparent to Madigan should he have stepped down. But Madigan has outlasted them. The women\u2019s caucus is sizable and has now become a political force. The Black caucus in the House has always been influential. Progressives have become a larger factor in the chamber and they will want to be represented. Members of Madigan\u2019s current leadership team want consideration.",

            "article_content": "Both opponents and supporters of abortion rights are investing heavily in the Georgia Senate runoff election next week, underscoring in their get-out-the-vote and fundraising efforts the crucial significance that a US Senate majority would offer each side as they look to advance their agenda under a new administration. That\u2019s why many of those activists have spent their holiday season working to draw supporters to the polls, whether for Democrats Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, or incumbent Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. Early voting wrapped this week and Election Day is Tuesday, January 5. If Democrats win both seats, they\u2019ll control the chamber with a 50-50 split decided by incoming Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. The Senate majority would determine whether measures expanding abortion access backed by the Democrat-led House and Democratic President-elect Joe Biden would meet a receptive vote or a thorny end. And on a much broader scale, whichever party takes the Senate holds the power to confirm or reject Biden\u2019s picks for the federal judiciary, a key part of determining national abortion policy as conservative state legislatures advance restrictions in hopes of overturning Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion nationwide. Anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List\u2019s partner Women Speak Out PAC is on track to exceed its projected $4.1 million campaign on the runoff, according to the group\u2019s president, Marjorie Dannenfelser. The campaign, which is slated to reach 1 million voters and make 750,000 in-person voter visits, features hand delivered absentee ballot applications as well as digital and mail ads, she said. Dannenfelser credits the rise of abortion as a focal issue in the race to the candidates deciding \u201cthat they\u2019re going to communicate (their stances on abortion) as part of their overall leadership, one way or the other.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got complete clarity between the two sets of candidates, and when you have complete clarity, that\u2019s a gift in politics, and it\u2019s something that can be defined \u2013 you can mobilize a base,\u201d she said, adding that, \u201cI think in Georgia, it\u2019s a set up for this to be the same dynamic as in many other type battlegrounds that \u2026 a reasonable abortion position puts you, gives you the edge.\u201d The organization has also issued Spanish-language ads targeting 100,000 Spanish-speaking voters in Georgia, which is 9.9% Latino, according to the US Census Bureau. \u201cWe had not planned on that in Georgia, not necessarily foreseeing that we would be interacting with a lot of Spanish-speaking, pro-life voters, but as it turns out, we are,\u201d Dannenfelser said, adding that \u201cwe want to meet people where they are.\u201d The group anticipates strong voter turnout for anti-abortion candidates among Hispanic voters and young women between the ages of 18 and 22, she said. On the other side, Planned Parenthood Votes has a six-figure campaign underway, according to Alicia Stallworth, the super PAC\u2019s Georgia state director. The group has sent nearly 400,000 text messages, made hundreds of daily phone calls and is part of a coalition of progressive groups that is over 85% of the way to its goal of knocking on five million doors, Stallworth said. Planned Parenthood Votes is canvassing in Cobb County, bordering Atlanta \u2013 Georgia\u2019s third most populous county, and home to a Planned Parenthood health center \u2013 and targeting demographics that include their supporters: women under the age of 35, people of color, White suburban voters and White college educated women, Stallworth added. \u201cOur ground game and our strategy is to organize to turn out voters, to try to repeat the same thing that we did in the general election,\u201d she said. She thinks that abortion has stepped into the runoff spotlight because Warnock \u201cis a pastor and we are in the South, so it\u2019s that outdated belief that he cannot be a minister and support women\u2019s reproductive rights.\u201d While both Loeffler and Perdue have pressed their opponents on their stances on abortion \u2013 asserting in a co-authored op-ed that Ossoff and Warnock are planning on \u201clegalizing late-term abortion, sending your tax dollars to fund abortions\u201d \u2013 Warnock has garnered much of the attention on the issue. Twenty-eight Black Christian ministers, mostly based in Georgia, sent a letter to Warnock several weeks ago lambasting him for supporting abortion rights. Churches, especially Christian evangelical churches in Georgia, have been a potent force among the electorate, and Georgia preachers have voiced support for the views of Senate candidates in both parties. Some conservative politicians have accused Warnock, who was born and raised in Savannah and has served as the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta for 15 years, of misleading voters regarding his identity and failing to represent the state\u2019s views. \u201cYou see this Warnock fella who\u2019s coming down here and disguising himself as some moderate pastor from the South who doesn\u2019t believe in these radical ideas,\u201d North Carolina Rep.-elect Madison Cawthorn told Fox News in mid-December. Cawthorn asserted that Warnock \u201csays he\u2019s a pastor, yet he\u2019s all about abortion. This is somebody who does not represent what real Americans believe.\u201d Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin asked a Georgia rally crowd in December, \u201cIs this a representation of the Democrats\u2019 heart in Georgia, to have a pro-abortion pastor who\u2019s running?\u201d She said that \u201cit\u2019s all the more reason why we have those in the Senate, especially those representing Georgia, who understand the sanctity of life.\u201d Loeffler highlighted her divisions with Warnock over abortion during the only televised debate in the Senate runoffs, beginning her argument, \u201cLook, I\u2019m not going to be lectured by someone who uses the Bible to justify abortion.\u201d \u201cListen,\u201d Warnock said as part of a broader response to the attack. \u201cI have a profound reverence for life and an abiding respect for choice. The question is, whose decision is it. And I happen to think that a patient\u2019s room is too small a place for a woman, her doctor and the US government \u2013 I think that\u2019s too many people in the room.\u201d Warnock has stood by his stance on the issue, tweeting, \u201cI am a pro-choice pastor\u201d and \u201cI will always fight for reproductive justice.\u201d A former sexual health educator, Warnock sent an email to supporters last month highlighting Loeffler\u2019s vote to confirm conservative Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and accusing Loeffler of \u201cattacking me for my unequivocal belief in a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d Georgia has historically taken a conservative stance on abortion, with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signing a \u201cheartbeat\u201d bill in 2019 banning abortion as early as six weeks into a pregnancy that was blocked in court in July 2020. But Biden won the state in the presidential election by less than 12,000 votes, marking the first time in 28 years that a Democrat won Georgia. The Democratic ticket\u2019s historic success was fueled by a grassroots organizing renaissance that rallied a rapidly diversifying electorate and suburbs that are, at once, growing and becoming increasingly inhospitable to Republican candidates. Polling on abortion in Georgia suggests that the issue is narrowly divided. According to CNN exit polling from Election Day, 52% of Georgia voters thought that abortion should be legal, while 43% thought it should be illegal. Those numbers also vary based on race \u2013 among White Georgia voters, 43% thought abortion should be legal while 53% thought it should be illegal, and among Black Georgia voters, 69% thought abortion should be legal while 24% thought it should be illegal. Planned Parenthood Action Fund President Alexis McGill Johnson, who appeared at a Get Out the Vote event with former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, told CNN that Abrams, whose group Fair Fight aims to help Democratic candidates by increasing voter turnout, and other partners in the state \u201chave been laying the groundwork for understanding sort of where progressive voters are in Georgia, and that it is a numbers game and a turnout game.\u201d \u201cParticularly in the middle of a pandemic, the opportunity to talk about health care, to talk about the impact that not having access to basic health care, including access to abortion, or limitations on that, really resonates with people,\u201d McGill Johnson said, adding that \u201cI definitely feel as though this is a winnable race because of the climate that we\u2019re in.\u201d The implications of who wins the challenges and thus the Senate could be swift. Biden backs repealing the Hyde Amendment, a provision in congressional funding bills since 1976 that currently bars federal funds from going toward abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother\u2019s life is at risk. Biden\u2019s position comes after making a dramatic shift during the Democratic primaries from his long-held support for the provision. And despite the current Republican-controlled Senate, Democrats in both chambers have signaled interest on various provisions expanding abortion access. Disagreements over Hyde were one of the sticking points in negotiations over the massive government spending bill for the new fiscal year, and House Democrats hosted a hearing last month, expressing hope of repealing Hyde. In the Senate, a markup of a funding bill was abruptly canceled in late 2019 after Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington requested a vote on her amendment reversing the Title X abortion referral rule that bars participating providers from referring patients for abortions, according to a Democratic aide. None of this is lost on Kristan Hawkins, the president of Students for Life Action, an anti-abortion group bringing over 200 students to Georgia with the goal of knocking on 70,000 doors and directly texting voters in a campaign costing at least $280,000. To Hawkins, abortion has emerged as a key issue in the Georgia runoff \u201cbecause the Supreme Court in 1973 handed down Roe v. Wade,\u201d which she characterized as \u201changing by a thread\u201d in light of the multiple legal cases in the pipeline for the conservative-majority court to consider. She pointed to the significance of Supreme Court picks as well as the multiple venues where the battle over abortion access is playing out. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it the \u2018Save the Senate\u2019 campaign because it\u2019s literally going to determine whether or not we can hold back taxpayer-funded abortion on demand and all nine months,\u201d Hawkins said, referring to efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment, \u201cwhether or not we can ensure that, you know, the Democrats do not try to pack the US Supreme court.\u201d Stallworth sees what\u2019s riding on the runoff as similarly critical. \u201cHonestly, I think everything is at stake in these two Senate seats,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially when we\u2019re talking about the fact that the two senators who we need to be elected will hold, will basically hold the fate of the nation in their hands when we know that women\u2019s reproductive rights are constantly being attacked.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kyung Lah, Kim Berryman, Donald Judd, Caroline Kenny and Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. On Christmas Eve, Dr. Anthony Fauci will turn 81. Having advised seven presidents in his role as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, he is one of America\u2019s best-known doctors and, for many, a trusted voice on Covid-19. He became so much a part of everyday life over the past two years that people started naming their pets \u201cFauci,\u201d although not quite at the rate owners called their cats and dogs \u201cZoom.\u201d Yet, as Frida Ghitis wrote, Fauci has been the target of increasingly overwrought attacks from the right for his role supporting vaccines and other proven measures to stem the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to top the once-respected Lara Logan, the South African reporter who left \u201960 Minutes\u2019 in disgrace and joined Fox News shortly after,\u201d Ghitis noted. \u201cDuring an appearance on Fox News Primetime on Monday, Logan equated Dr. Anthony Fauci \u2013 the top infectious diseases doctor in the United States and one of the world\u2019s most respected scientists \u2013 with none other than Dr. Josef Mengele, the Nazi doctor known as the \u2018Angel of Death\u2019 for performing brutally cruel experiments on concentration camp prisoners during World War II\u2026\u201d \u201cLogan\u2019s words resonated around the world, provoking a furious reaction. The Auschwitz Museum in Poland, on the site where Nazis murdered more than 1 million human beings, mostly Jews, rebuked Logan,\u201d calling her words \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201ca sad symptom of moral and intellectual decline.\u201d Ghitis observed, \u201cas long as there\u2019s a massive propaganda effort aimed at keeping people from accepting the vaccine, the arrival of Omicron is one more warning shot, one more sign that the pandemic can exploit social weaknesses, divisions and cynicism to continue preventing us from getting back our full lives. Those who tell the lies are at least partly responsible for everyone\u2019s continuing plight.\u201d Misinformation isn\u2019t just coming from personalities on politically oriented, right-wing outlets such as Fox News. \u201cAt least five conservative radio hosts who warned their audiences against the vaccine have died of Covid in recent months,\u201d wrote Nicole Hemmer. \u201cBut the death of Marcus Lamb this week highlights a different network of misinformation that has nearly as broad a reach in conservative circles but receives far less attention in political media: conservative Christian broadcasters.\u201d Lamb, a televangelist and founder of the Daystar network, was \u201ca major source of Covid-19 misinformation\u201d and \u201cdied after being hospitalized with the disease,\u201d Hemmer noted. Daystar is part of a cohort of religious \u201cmedia outlets that enormous audiences of Americans consume on a regular basis, and that most political outlets tend to ignore.\u201d It\u2019s still not clear how serious a threat the Omicron variant poses, but it\u2019s already casting a shadow over people\u2019s lives, wrote David M. Perry. \u201cOnce upon a time, I hoped that preventive measures would push Covid-19 from pandemic to endemic by the end of this year, but that\u2019s clearly not happening,\u201d Perry wrote. \u201cBut in the meantime, I\u2019m not finding it realistic to try and return my own or my family\u2019s behavior to the harsh practices of the last year\u2026\u201d \u201cHanukkah is here, Christmas is coming, and my mixed-faith family craves community. With rapid tests, good masks, and smart communication, we can make it through this Omicron scare without repeating last year\u2019s winter isolation. But there\u2019s still such a long road ahead until we\u2019re once again made whole.\u201d South Africa was the first nation to identify the Omicron variant, and numerous world leaders responded by restricting travel from the country and several others in Africa. Alane Izu, a senior statistician, and Shabir A. Madhi, a professor of vaccinology at the University of Witwatersrand, said the travel bans will likely hurt their country \u201cwhile providing little protection from Omicron to the rest of the world. South Africa should not be punished for being quick to identify the variant and notify the world of its presence. The promises heads of states made at the G20 summit in October to be collaborative in rebuilding the world tourism sector have seemingly been disregarded \u2013 and these travel restrictions are a misguided result\u2026if Omicron cases had first emerged in a North American or Western European nation, would similar travel bans have been implemented?\u201d For more: Syra Madad and Jacob Glanville: How to fight Covid-19 while the scientists wait for answers on Omicron Dean Obeidallah: The Omicron coronavirus variant is a crucial test for Biden In the past four months, there have been 32 shootings at K-12 schools in the US. But there was something different about the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s killings at Oxford High School in Michigan. Ethan Crumbley, the 15-year-old accused of shooting to death four fellow students, has been charged with terrorism in addition to other crimes. His parents have been charged with involuntary manslaughter, following the report the student\u2019s father, James Crumbley, purchased the 9 mm Sig Sauer gun on Black Friday and kept it unlocked in a bedroom drawer, according to prosecutors. The next day, his mother posted on social media, referring to \u201cmom and son day testing out his new Christmas present.\u201d The day before the shooting, a teacher raised concerns about Ethan, and his parents were summoned to the school the next morning when another teacher found a disturbing drawing on his desk \u2013 but none of the advance warnings prevented the killings. \u201cIt\u2019s unconscionable that his dad purchased the weapon, and that both parents failed to take the school\u2019s warnings seriously, even though they knew their son had access to a gun,\u201d wrote Kara Alaimo. \u201cThe Crumbleys\u2019 apparent lack of concern for the welfare of the other children in their community is absolutely staggering.\u201d Prosecuting the parents is a step forward, according to Alaimo, who wrote that it \u201ccould serve as a powerful warning that helps reduce the number of school shootings in this country.\u201d  The Michigan shooting was \u201canother tragic reminder that the government has failed to address the need for stricter gun control,\u201d Julian Zelizer observed. \u201cSchool shootings became more infrequent during the pandemic, with students learning remotely from home. Now that kids are finally able to return to the classroom, however, this is the risk \u2013 and the terror \u2013 they face once again.\u201d The plague of school mass shootings is the \u201cepidemic\u201d America is failing to confront, wrote Zelizer. \u201cAlthough Congress passed the first federal gun control law in 1934, the gun lobby has in more recent decades exerted its influence on allies in the House and Senate to prevent tighter restrictions on the sale of guns and ammunition\u2026 This country has had enough with limiting the response only to \u2018thoughts and prayers\u2019 \u2013 it\u2019s time to pass stronger gun control legislation. Our children deserve nothing less.\u201d Mark Meadows, who served as former president Donald Trump\u2019s last White House chief of staff, revealed in a new book obtained by the Guardian that Trump tested positive for Covid-19 three days before his first debate with Joe Biden. As Michael D\u2019Antonio noted, \u201cThe book says another test in that period came back negative. Meadows\u2019 revelation could mean the then-president entered the venue even though he might have been endangering the lives of everyone there. For Trump, all\u2019s fair in politics, it seems, including possibly exposing one\u2019s opponent to a deadly pathogen. On Wednesday, Trump issued a statement denying that he had Covid prior to the debate\u2026 the uncertainty over which test was correct should have led to caution. What reasonable person would hide all this and proceed as normal? Indeed, four days after the debate, Trump was rushed to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for Covid care.\u201d Meadows also made news by agreeing to cooperate, at least to some degree, with the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. For more: Joshua A. Douglas: The attacks on the 2024 election are already underway For 48 years, Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruling supporting abortion rights, has been the law of the land. But based on the oral arguments in a case heard by the Court this week, that could well change by the end of its term in June. The consequences would be massive, wrote Mary Ziegler: \u201cTo overturn the 1973 decision would be a profound statement about women\u2019s liberty and autonomy \u2013 a social and political earthquake that would fundamentally alter the lives of many.\u201d She added, \u201cA decision eliminating Roe would mean that somewhere between 20 and 25 states would criminalize virtually all abortions, transforming the lives of people across large swathes of the South and Midwest. And overruling Roe would likely cut against popular opinion \u2013 well over half of Americans do not want abortion rights eliminated \u2013 putting the Court at risk of a backlash that could damage its public standing and jumpstart conversations about court reform.\u201d Journalist Claudia Dreifus wrote that she \u201ccan remember what life was like for women in the years before Roe. To be of childbearing age in the 1960s, as my friends and I were, meant knowing that our bodies and our futures didn\u2019t belong to us. Whatever we hoped to do with our lives could be compromised by the capriciousness of nature or by a thoughtless mistake or a contraceptive mishap\u2026 Whether or not Roe survives, the lesson we must all learn is that preserving our rights \u2013 be they in speech, citizenship, privacy or reproduction \u2013 requires constant vigilance.\u201d Only a couple of weeks after the House censured Rep. Paul Gosar for posting a manipulated anime video showing him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, videos posted on Facebook showed one of his fellow Republicans, Rep. Lauren Boebert speaking about an encounter she had in a Capitol Hill elevator with Rep. Ilhan Omar, calling the Democratic congresswoman a member of the \u201cjihad squad\u201d and implying Omar was a terrorist. Boebert \u201coffered a weak apology,\u201d according to Lincoln Mitchell, who observed, \u201cThere is no question that Boebert\u2019s comments were deeply bigoted, that Gosar\u2019s violent fantasies are disturbing and that neither are conducting themselves the way most of us would like to see members of Congress \u2013 regardless of party \u2013 behave. But it is not at all obvious that censure, and a corresponding stripping of committee assignments, is the right, or even useful, solution to this problem.\u201d The leader of the GOP minority in the House, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, should be calling out the bigotry, wrote SE Cupp. \u201cIt seems like the party is fine with these attacks on a Muslim member of Congress, the way it was fine with another Republican Congressman\u2019s tweeting out of a death fantasy video against another woman of color and member of Congress. And yes, Republicans who don\u2019t condemn this are complicit\u2026\u201d Jill Filipovic: Elizabeth Holmes can be two things at once Peter Bergen: She went back to Kabul after the Taliban shot her, then had to flee again Peniel E.

The movie reminds us, Gene Seymour wrote, of Sondheim\u2019s \u201cspectacular Broadway breakthrough in 1957 as lyricist to Leonard Bernstein\u2019s music and Arthur Laurent\u2019s libretto updating \u2018Romeo and Juliet\u2019 from Italy at the hinge of the 13th and 14th centuries to the meaner streets of upper Manhattan in the middle of the 20th.\u201d The comparisons people have made between Sondheim and the creator of \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d are not far-fetched, Seymour observed. William Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cTo be or not to be\u201d is in a class of its own. But, Seymour argued, the song \u201cBeing Alive\u201d from the 1970 musical \u201cCompany\u201d is the closest thing in Sondheim\u2019s work to the Hamlet soliloquy. \u201cIndeed, any musical soliloquy \u2013 and there are dozens of them \u2013 from Sondheim\u2019s collected works are such compendiums of emotional range and complexity that they can be viewed as mini-dramas of their own,\u201d Seymour wrote. As for the new \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d early reviews are enthusiastic. \u201cSteven Spielberg\u2019s West Side Story 2.0 is an ecstatic act of ancestor-worship: a vividly dreamed, cunningly modified and visually staggering revival,\u201d wrote the Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw. \u201cNo one but Spielberg could have brought it off, creating a movie in which Leonard Bernstein\u2019s score and Stephen Sondheim\u2019s lyrics blaze out with fierce new clarity.\u201d",

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Michael Flynn, Donald Trump\u2019s former National Security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and was later pardoned by Trump, wants to make it clear that in the United States, \u201cIf we are going to have one nation under God \u2013 which we must \u2013 we have to have one religion.\u201d Of course, to Flynn, that one religion is Christianity. (After all, 75% of White evangelicals voted for Trump in the 2020 election, according to exit polls.) Flynn made these remarks in Texas on Saturday as part of the \u201cReAwaken America Tour,\u201d a conservative conference that features other Trump supporters, like Roger Stone and the My Pillow CEO/election conspiracy peddler Mike Lindell. While speaking at the event, Flynn referenced a passage from the New Testament book of Matthew, saying, \u201cYou have to believe this, that God Almighty is, like, involved in this country, because this is it \u2026 This is the shining city on the hill.\u201d That\u2019s when Flynn triggered a wave of backlash with his suggestion America should have one singular religion. \u201cOne nation under God, and one religion under God,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what your ecumenical service is or what you are.\u201d Now imagine if a Muslim or Jewish American leader made the same comment that the United States should have one faith, and that it should be Islam or Judaism. The outrage from the right would be deafening. But with Flynn\u2019s comments, there hasn\u2019t been noticeable pushback from conservatives. In fact, it\u2019s been the opposite. GOP Ohio Senate candidate Josh Mandel, who is Jewish, appears to see Flynn\u2019s comments as being in step with his own \u201cJudeo-Christian values\u201d: \u201cWe Stand with General Flynn,\u201d Mandel tweeted in response to the backlash. \u201cAmerica was not founded as a secular nation.\u201d Politics does truly make strange bedfellows. 'Patriot Purge' has a chilling method to its utter madness In contrast, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is Muslim American, tweeted in response to Flynn\u2019s comments, \u201cThese people hate the US Constitution.\u201d I don\u2019t know if Flynn and those who support his mindset \u201chate\u201d the Constitution, but I am certain that they either don\u2019t believe in or don\u2019t understand our Constitution and the freedom of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment. This is the same Flynn who in 2016 repeatedly pushed debunked conspiracy theories that there was an effort to impose Islamic Sharia law on the rest of the country. \u201cThis Sharia law business, what\u2019s happening right here in the state of Texas is unbelievable,\u201d Flynn said at a San Antonio event that year hosted by ACT! for America, an anti-Muslim hate group per the Anti-Defamation League. At another 2016 speech in Texas, as CNN detailed, Flynn again falsely claimed there are Muslims who want to dominate America by imposing Islamic law: \u201cI want people to understand that there are different laws that are not our laws that others try to impose,\u201d he said. As a Muslim, let me be clear that there aren\u2019t any Muslims \u2013 then or now \u2013 trying to impose any of our religious beliefs onto the law of the United States. This was simply part of the right-wing demonization of Muslims because it played well with the GOP base. It\u2019s the same reason why, during the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump lied on NBC saying Muslims \u201cdon\u2019t want the laws that we have. They want Sharia law.\u201d It didn't go well for Texas at the Supreme Court Beyond despicably demonizing other faiths, these examples show an idea of \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d that ironically revolves around imposing one\u2019s beliefs upon the rest of us. Several on the right have been showing us that for years. For example, when Mike Huckabee ran for president in 2008, he bluntly said the US Constitution should be amended \u201cso it\u2019s in God\u2019s standard\u201d \u2013 phrasing he later clarified after critics caught wind of the quote. And during his 2012 presidential run, Rick Santorum declared \u201cour civil laws have to comport with a higher law: God\u2019s law.\u201d These Republicans were telling all who would listen that their goal was turning their religious beliefs into American law. And we now have Republicans doing just that with their religion-based oppression of women\u2019s reproductive rights. The most visible example is the Texas GOP\u2019s anti-abortion law, which has garnered headlines for empowering private citizens to behave as vigilantes with the ability to sue anyone involved in securing an abortion beyond about six weeks of pregnancy. When Texas\u2019 Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed the legislation, he explained the rationale behind it as being faith-based: \u201cOur creator endowed us with the right to life, and yet millions of children lose their right to life every year because of abortion,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Texas, we work to save those lives and that\u2019s exactly what the Texas Legislature did this session.\u201d That\u2019s the same reasoning behind the Arkansas ban on nearly all abortions except to save the life of the mother. When the state\u2019s GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed it, he declared the law was predicated upon his \u201csincere and long-held pro-life convictions.\u201d (As with the Texas law, Arkansas\u2019 ban has faced legal challenges for its obvious violation of Roe v. Wade.)  These laws are based on the religious belief held by some that life begins at conception. Having the freedom to personally follow one\u2019s faith is what our nation is predicated upon. Turning those religious beliefs into laws every American then must follow, however, is not. In fact, it\u2019s un-American, given that our First Amendment states \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\u201d No one should be surprised by Flynn\u2019s comments. He\u2019s simply repeating what some in the GOP have long championed: The idea that \u201cfreedom of religion\u201d is imposing their religious beliefs upon the rest of us. It\u2019s no wonder, then, why many on Twitter reacted to Flynn\u2019s comments with the phrase \u201cAmerican Taliban.\u201d",

President Joe Biden\u2019s private audience with Pope Francis on Friday at the Vatican was a moment to reconsider the role that faith plays in American politics \u2013 and whether it can be depolarized going forward. For decades, faith has been used to divide people along partisan lines. Since the 1980s, White evangelicals have overwhelmingly backed Republicans as a badge of identity, often in opposition to abortion and LGBT rights, with Donald Trump winning a higher percentage of their votes in 2016. It was even more than George W. Bush, an actual evangelical whose faith was central to his identity, got in his two presidential elections. But whether you agree or disagree with his policies, Biden is undeniably a man of faith, who attends church regularly and reportedly carries a rosary in his pocket. He quoted a Catholic hymn in his post-election victory speech and St. Augustine in his inaugural address. In addition, Democrats now have Rev. Raphael Warnock serving in the US Senate from Georgia, making it perhaps just a bit more difficult to portray their party as Godless heathens \u2013 or \u201csecular humanists\u201d as the case may be. Even Pope Francis is a symbol of a comparatively liberal Christian tradition, at odds with many conservative traditionalists in his own church. And so it\u2019s notable that in recent weeks, evangelical leaders have met with Biden at the White House and made a faith-based case for the passage of the child tax credit as part of his budget. It\u2019s a reminder that so much Biblical wisdom is based on caring for the poor and the needy, and not simply focused on social conservative restrictions. This is a glimpse of a progressive Christian tradition that has been eclipsed by the rise of the religious right. But in the 1960s, faith-based leaders from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel marched together for civil rights. And in the 1970s, Jimmy Carter rallied the faithful to become the first born-again evangelical president of the modern era. But beginning with Baptist minister Jerry Falwell\u2019s Moral Majority rallying around Ronald Reagan in 1980, evangelicals have become a powerful conservative voting bloc comprising as much as a quarter of the total electorate. And while Biden made modest gains with faith-based voters in 2020, a Pew survey from May found that Biden\u2019s approval ratings among religious groups were the mirror image of Trump\u2019s \u2013 with his highest support among Black protestants and the lowest among White evangelicals. But interestingly, Christians overall were twice as likely to say they liked the way Biden conducted himself in the presidency compared to Trump. It\u2019s safe to say that we\u2019re still a long way from overcoming our religious-political divides. Biden\u2019s meeting with Francis came as a handful of Catholic bishops in the US have called for Biden to be denied communion for his stance favoring abortion, despite Pope Francis\u2019 declaration that politics should not drive these decisions. The blurring of faith and politics can cause family divides, as Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger from Illinois found when family members denounced him for going against \u201cChristian principles\u201d and joined \u201cthe devil\u2019s army\u201d after he called for Trump\u2019s removal and refused to back the big lie following the January 6 Capitol riot. Incidentally, the Bible warns against lying at least 116 times \u2013 including in the 10 commandments.  But who\u2019s counting? The larger issue \u2013 and opportunity \u2013 is to depolarize associations of faith with one political party. There should be competing visions of how to apply faith to public policy, offered with moral humility. And if a progressive vision of Christianity emerges as a counterweight to the religious right, it may elevate our debates and help us reunite as a nation in commitment to the common good.",

View more opinion at CNN. Amy Coney Barrett, who was confirmed to the Supreme Court a year ago, gave a speech a few weeks ago in which she said the justices were not \u201cpartisan hacks.\u201d Justice Barrett did this at the University of Louisville, at the 30th anniversary celebration of a center named in honor of Mitch McConnell, Republican minority leader in the US Senate. A few months after Justice Neal Gorsuch was confirmed, in 2017, he delivered a similar message at the McConnell Center. A little over a year after Justice Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed in 2018, he traveled to Louisville to swear in a McConnell prot\u00e9g\u00e9 as a federal judge. The three Supreme Court justices \u2013 all appointees of the former President, Donald Trump \u2013 performed these acts of deference and gratitude to McConnell for very good reason. The former majority leader of the Senate engineered their confirmations despite incendiary political controversies. McConnell jammed through Barrett\u2019s nomination at lightning speed ahead of the 2020 presidential election; he did this after in 2016 stonewalling President Barack Obama\u2019s nomination of Merrick Garland (now President Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general) to the same vacancy so that a Republican president could fill the seat that went to Gorsuch. And McConnell pushed through Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation despite a highly credible accusation of sexual assault against the nominee (which Kavanaugh denies). To be sure, the three justices owe as much or more to McConnell for their positions as they do to the president who nominated them. It\u2019s therefore all the more ironic, even outrageous, that \u2013 just weeks before the Supreme Court began a new term that promises to be profoundly consequential \u2013 Barrett could stand before McConnell in Louisville last month and pretend that the Supreme Court has nothing to do with politics. In this, Barrett was just repeating a fiction that justices on both the left and right have been peddling for years. Justice Sotomayor tells the truth about the Supreme Court In a recent speech at Notre Dame, Clarence Thomas, the longest-tenured associate justice, said, \u201cI think the media makes it sound as though you are just always going right to your personal preference. So if they think you are anti-abortion or something personally, they think that\u2019s the way you always will come out. They think you\u2019re for this or for that. They think you become like a politician.\u201d In the words of Justice Stephen Breyer, the senior liberal on the court, he and his colleagues are not \u201cnine junior varsity politicians.\u201d Even the justices themselves acknowledge that the Democratic and Republican appointees to the court disagree about many of the most controversial issues before them. But they have an innocent explanation for this situation. As Barrett put it in her speech, \u201cjudicial philosophies are not the same as political parties.\u201d Really? If they are not the same, they are awfully close. Barrett and the other conservatives on the court call themselves \u201cOriginalists,\u201d which mean they believe the words of the Constitution should be interpreted as they were understood by the 18th-century authors and ratifiers of the document. Liberal jurists, in contrast, believe in a \u201cliving Constitution,\u201d meaning its words have to be understood in the context of the time in which we are living. The distinction may seem academic, but the implications are intensely political. \u201cOriginalists\u201d believe that the Constitution does not protect a woman\u2019s right to choose abortion; that many campaign finance laws violate the First Amendment; and those states should have the right to apply the death penalty without interference from the federal courts. Liberals believe the opposite on these issues and scores of others as well. It cannot then be a great surprise that \u201coriginalism\u201d vs. \u201cliving\u201d constitutionalism maps up with great precision against Republican vs. Democrat. And you know who knows this? The presidents of the United States who make the nominations to the court. Donald Trump said with admirable candor that he would appoint justices who will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that guaranteed women the constitutional right to choose abortion. Indeed, in a 2016 debate with Hillary Clinton, Trump said that overturning Roe \u201cwill happen automatically\u201d if he had the chance to name justices. He did, and they will. They may already have done so. In a brief, almost offhand ruling issued in the middle of the night on August 31, a five-justice majority allowed a Texas law that effectively bans abortion in the state to go into effect. The five originalists on the court voted not to block the law; the three liberals, plus Chief Justice John Roberts, a Republican who has not embraced originalism, dissented.  When the court hears a full-fledged case this year from Mississippi about a similarly restrictive abortion law, they may simply apply the coup de grace to Roe, after they mortally wounded it this summer. In the end, it doesn\u2019t really matter if you call what the majority is doing \u201cjudicial philosophy\u201d or \u201cpolitics.\u201d What matters is that the justices are doing what Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell put them on the court to do. A trip to Louisville is a small price to pay for that privilege.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign was built on two pillars \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m going to shut down the virus\u201d and I am not Donald Trump. He is failing on both promises, as Covid rages and Biden\u2019s behavior more and more mirrors his predecessor\u2019s. Biden\u2019s message to the country on Thursday, in which he outlined his new six-point strategy to handle the Covid-19 pandemic, was (another) tirade from a president who promised to unify the country in his inaugural address, but has devolved into an angry, lecturing partisan as his administration drowns in criticism from the public over Afghanistan, the economy, and a surge in coronavirus cases nationwide. When you are the president, you have two primary ways to move people to your point of view: inspiration or coercion. It was said that Biden would employ the former, but he has resorted to the latter via a series of executive mandates and scolding speeches as he seeks higher vaccination rates. Gone is the soaring rhetoric of Biden\u2019s campaign, replaced with the kind of bile and disdain many Americans hated about \u201cthe former guy,\u201d as Biden would say. It is doubtful this will work. In fact, it may backfire as many unvaccinated Americans recoil against being told what to do when it comes to their own health care, if you believe recent polling. Heck, the same day Biden was rolling out his plan directing the Labor Department to require all employers with more than 100 workers to require either the vaccine or regular testing, Vice President Kamala Harris was making videos supporting abortion rights using the my body, my choice arguments common on the left. Which is it, guys? Biden's six-point Covid plan leaves some holes Perhaps one of the Biden administration\u2019s biggest failures handling the pandemic has been these kinds of mixed messages. Harris early on was one of the worst offenders, stating in a debate that she would take the vaccine when health officials said it was ready, but not if President Donald Trump said so. I suspect this is a similar feeling some of the unvaccinated have at being told to take a vaccine by President Joe Biden. Health experts overwhelmingly agree the vaccine should be taken, but the reflexive partisan instinct to reject advice from politicians you hate isn\u2019t confined to one party, even as Democrats have memory-holed their own part in causing vaccine hesitancy. After taking office, the mixed messages from Biden and Harris continued. In April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration abruptly paused use of the Johnson & Johnson one-dose Covid-19 vaccine after extremely rare reports of blood clots. White House officials didn\u2019t immediately brief the President and the news seemed to have caught the administration off guard. The handling of the situation soon turned messy and officials worried it could erode the public\u2019s trust in the vaccine. (The pause was ultimately lifted, but the damage was already done.) In August, CNN reported, \u201cTop health officials in the Biden administration have added to the confusion with a series of contradictory messages on everything from masks to mandates.\u201d And more recently, on booster shots, the Financial Times reported that \u201cBiden\u2019s Covid booster shot plan\u201d was \u201cmired in confusion amid regulatory hold-ups.\u201d Two weeks ago, two senior leaders in the FDA\u2019s vaccine review office announced they\u2019re stepping down this fall, further depleting an agency with an eroded morale due to the workload and that still doesn\u2019t have a permanent head eight months into Biden\u2019s term. Charlie Dent: An Afghan refugee lived with my family. Biden has let her and her country down And during his speech Thursday, Biden said his new plan was necessary to \u201cprotect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers.\u201d If you believe in the efficacy of the vaccines, why do the vaccinated need protection? Yes, there have been some breakthrough infections, but they are extremely rare and mild. If you were already skeptical of whether you needed a vaccine, there\u2019s a strong chance you would interpret Biden\u2019s words and actions as a total lack of confidence that these shots work. Time and again, when given a chance to inspire and unify, Biden and his team have confused and hectored the very unvaccinated Americans he needs to reach the most. It was just in July that his CDC director, Rochelle Walensky, and White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that there would be no national vaccination mandates. Now we have mandates and an angry president who has given up on his supposed legendary empathy in favor of the kind of dictatorial style that Democrats once hammered Trump for. The pandemic is being weaponized As a political matter, Biden may find some running room on his mandate plan. Polling conducted by the Associated Press in late August found majority support for mandates, driven largely by people who have already gotten their shots. And a new CNN poll shows Americans have grown more supportive of mandates. His statement that \u201cpatience is wearing thin\u201d with the unvaccinated will find resonance with a great many people, including Republicans like me who made the easy personal decision to get vaccinated after reviewing the data and situation. This isn\u2019t a question of smart politics; rather, it is whether Biden\u2019s move will convince the unvaccinated crowd to get their shots. And there\u2019s nothing in his plan or attitude, even if it works for him politically, that rallies skeptical Americans to view that the vaccine works. Polling from the Washington Post, in fact, indicated that 7 in 10 unvaccinated workers who were not self-employed would likely quit their jobs if mandated to get a vaccine at work and no exemptions were offered.  Ultimately, the American people will render a midterm report card on Biden\u2019s Covid leadership when they vote in the November 2022 election. If they hold the President to his own words, it won\u2019t be pretty: \u201c220,000 Americans dead\u2026 Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths shouldn\u2019t remain as President of the United States of America,\u201d Biden said on October 22, 2020, to lead off a debate against Donald Trump. As of September, over 210,000 Americans have died of Covid-19 since Biden took office, according to the CDC\u2019s tracking data. We\u2019ve reached the threshold of presidential failure, according to Biden himself. The question now is: Can the president turn it around, or has he just settled on a political course rather than one that has a fighting chance of unifying the American people?",

Schiavo\u2019s parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, objected to the husband\u2019s actions and unsuccessfully litigated the matter. The courts ruled with her husband over her parents at every turn. So why did Congress intervene back then? Because some ardently anti-abortion members of Congress thoughtlessly took on this case as a way to burnish their pro-life credentials. Setting aside the fact that the case was clearly a state and judicial matter, these members charged ahead anyway, federalism and separation of powers be damned. A private bill, Terri\u2019s law, was enacted in record time. I was one of five House Republicans to vote against this invasive and egregious federal overreach. The optics of this debacle were manifest to the American people who were horrified that Congress would intervene in such a painful, personal family dispute which had been thoroughly litigated and settled in court. Approval ratings of Congressional Republicans suffered as a consequence and the Terri Schiavo case may have contributed to the GOP losing control of both the House and Senate in the 2006 midterm election. Which leads me to the Texas law that bans abortion at around six weeks, once a fetal heartbeat can be detected. Like the Terri Schiavo intervention, the Texas law is extreme and completely over the top. Banning abortion at six weeks, when most women don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant, with no exceptions for rape or incest, is problematic enough. But providing $10,000 awards to citizens if they successfully sue anyone who helps women access lawful medical services smacks of a sinister, Orwellian invasion of privacy. Congressional intervention in the Terri Schiavo case offended the sensibilities of many Americans. The Texas law will, too. When ideological zealotry trumps common sense, expect a backlash. The sinister genius of Texas abortion law As one of the last two pro-choice Republicans to serve in the House of Representatives, I may have been an outlier with the House GOP Conference, but not with my constituents and the American people. Throughout my life, I have witnessed the GOP chase moderate, pro-choice women (and men) from the party. Yes, while many Americans are conflicted on abortion and are willing to accept some restrictions or limitations on issues like public funding or parental notification, most want abortion to remain legal under most circumstances. This problem began in 1980 with the much-admired Ronald Reagan who, as a presidential candidate, opposed abortion rights and the Equal Rights Amendment and incorporated these views in the Republican platform as a way to bring evangelicals and anti-abortion voters more solidly under the GOP umbrella. It should also be remembered that, as governor of California, Ronald Reagan signed into law one of the most permissive abortion rights laws in the country. The Republican Party\u2019s shift on this issue came at a political cost, and the party lost many women voters. My late aunt, Mary Dent Crisp, resigned her position in protest over platform changes as co-chair of the Republican National Committee during the 1980 GOP Convention in Detroit. She warned then that there would be real political consequences to the GOP if it turned its back on the Equal Rights Amendment and women\u2019s reproductive rights. She was right 41 years ago, as the gender gap Republicans are experiencing \u2013 particularly college-educated suburban women \u2013 continues to worsen. But back in Texas, the state legislature believes they will be rewarded by taking away rights granted under Roe v. Wade. What they have provided to Democrats is a golden opportunity to drive the gender gap to epic proportions. Democrats currently face daunting odds to maintain their narrow congressional majority in the 2022 midterm election and the Texas GOP has handed them an issue they will most certainly weaponize in any competitive district the GOP has in its sights. Congressional Republicans should be playing offense and putting the Democrats on their heels over the massive $3.5 trillion reconciliation spending blow out and the surrender of Afghanistan to the Taliban. Instead, Texas Republicans have put the GOP on its spurs. Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. During my nearly 14-year tenure in Congress, it always amazed me that some members constantly wanted to beat the drum on abortion politics. I felt strongly there was no winning with it \u2013 and so it was better to leave the issue alone as much as possible and focus on bread-and-butter issues more relevant to the lives of ordinary Americans who are not fixated on intractable social issues.  Defunding Planned Parenthood, requiring mandatory transvaginal ultrasounds for women exercising their reproductive rights, opposing embryonic stem cell research, backing life-begins-at-conception laws and constitutional amendments, and banning pre-viability abortions are all issues Republicans have advanced in Washington and state capitols across the country during my nearly 28 years of elected service. None of these issues were ever popular on a national scale, nor were they ever winning political issues. One would think that after the disastrous congressional intervention into the Terri Schiavo matter, some folks would have learned their lesson to never put their faces on the hot stove again.",

View more opinion on CNN. Former Vice President Mike Pence is seizing his chance. After four humiliating years playing the role of the President\u2019s lapdog, which culminated in his fleeing a mob of Trump supporters, who threatened his life during the US Capitol attack on January 6, Pence seems to have begun his push to claim the presidency for himself. In a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on Thursday, Pence decried the attack, which was fueled by Trump\u2019s repeated lie that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d from him. \u201cTruth is, there is almost no idea more un-American than the notion that any one person could choose the American president,\u201d Pence said. He went on to add that he would \u201calways be proud\u201d that he fulfilled his obligation to approve the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election win. By clearing what is obviously a very low bar \u2013 taking a stand against an effort to undermine our democracy \u2013 Pence benefits from looking and sounding like a credible politician who might just rescue the GOP from the former president\u2019s control. But Pence also tried the classic politician\u2019s two-step and followed up his veiled criticism of Trump by lauding him as the best conservative president in modern history. Pence, who went on to employ some of his former boss\u2019 scare tactics during the speech, could end up being a more polished iteration of Trump by employing the same dangerous talking points, but with the air of a dignified statesman. Pence\u2019s attempt to break with Trump may be an attempt to build a broader coalition in the run up to 2024. When Trump ran for president in 2016, choosing Pence as his running mate was an obvious bid to win the support of conservative Christians. Pence, a former radio host who went on to become the governor of Indiana, was one of the most successful conservative Christian politicians in the country. His presence seemed to appease those who had doubts about Trump\u2019s comments and behavior but otherwise liked his positions, especially as they related to so-called \u201cculture war\u201d issues regarding abortion and LGBTQ rights. The big problem with Supreme Court's cheerleader ruling Trump seemed to deliver for White evangelical Christians throughout his four-year term.  However, in the months leading up to the 2020 election, there were signs their support might be wavering. According to exit polls, their support for Trump slipped by 4 points compared with 2016. Although this was a small drop, it was an opening for Pence to put a little distance between himself and Trump. By diverging from Trump on the January 6th attack, Pence produced a handy sound bite to reassure those who were appalled.  But anyone who paid close attention to the rest of Pence\u2019s speech would have picked up on his attempt to lay claim to the Trumpiest in the GOP. He suggested that Trump was a more consequential conservative than Ronald Reagan. \u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership we were able to achieve things Republicans have been talking about since the days of Barry Goldwater,\u201d said Pence. Pence also described the two presidents as \u201cone of a kind\u201d and praised them for being disruptors who challenged the establishment. The Reagan comparison was called out by Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican who is among a handful in his caucus who voted to impeach Trump after January 6. \u201cReagan inspired. Trump destroyed,\u201d noted Kinzinger on Twitter. \u201cNo comparison. I am still amazed at these people that are so deferential to the weakest man I ever met.\u201d Derek Chauvin sentenced to 22.5 years in death of George Floyd Pence also displayed his willingness to play Trump\u2019s divisive culture war game by criticizing \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d an academic concept that looks at racism not simply as a conscious effort carried out by individuals, but a systemic problem built into many of our institutions. Academics who work with this theory use it to examine how people can unwittingly amplify the effects of racism. Though there is little to no evidence to support the notion that it is discussed anywhere outside of universities, some on the right have claimed the theory is used in grade school to damaging effect. \u201cCritical race theory teaches children as young as kindergarten to be ashamed of their skin color,\u201d said Pence during his speech. \u201cIt represents a full-throated assault aimed at the heart of the American experiment.\u201d In criticizing Trump and exploiting the critical race theory bogeyman in the same speech, Pence is trying to have his cake and eat it too. He wants the kudos that come with defending democracy and the energizing power that comes with stoking White grievance \u2013 a tactic Trump capitalized on with great success. This move may put Pence on track to run for president in 2024. It also affirms that as a man who held political office for the last 20 years straight, he understands the first principle of American politics as described by the famous boss of New York\u2019s Tammany Hall more than a century ago.  In a little book published in 1905, the politician George Washington Plunkitt offered what he called \u201ca series of very plain talks on very practical politics.\u201d In a passage addressing graft that has since been accepted as a bit of universal political wisdom, Plunkitt declared, \u201cI seen my opportunities and I took \u2018em.\u201d  Of Pence, Plunkitt would be proud.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Peter Bergen is CNN\u2019s national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is author of the forthcoming book \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Osama bin Laden.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN. For the first time the United States has a government-wide strategy to counter domestic terrorism.  The policy, which the Biden administration rolled out on Tuesday, is long overdue. After all, the most lethal terrorist attack in the United States before 9/11 was the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building a quarter of a century ago, in which 168 people were killed by right-wing terrorists. In recent years, right-wing extremists have carried out a number of lethal attacks, such as the assault in El Paso, Texas in 2019 that killed 22 people, the attack at a Pittsburgh synagogue a year earlier that killed 11 people and the attack at a Black church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015 that killed nine congregants. And in January, there was the unprecedented assault on the US Capitol by right-wing extremists seeking to overturn the results of the presidential election. The new strategy issued by the White House points out that the domestic terrorism threat is principally from \u201cracially or ethnically motivated violent extremists\u2026 and militia violent extremists\u201d who present \u201cthe most persistent and lethal threats.\u201d The strategy explains that these domestic extremists \u201coften radicalize independently\u201d because of what they are reading online \u201cmaking detection and disruption difficult.\u201d What the Jan. 6 riot report was too afraid to say The difficulty of stopping \u201clone actor\u201d terrorists also characterized US government efforts after 9/11 when it came to preventing Americans from radicalizing because of propaganda from al-Qaeda or ISIS that they had read online. Omar Mateen, for instance, killed 49 people at an Orlando nightclub in 2016. Mateen had no contact with ISIS, yet he had become radicalized by what he had read and seen online and in the name of ISIS he carried out the most lethal act of terrorism in the US since the 9/11 attacks. The issue is also made more complicated because being a radical is, of course, not a crime in the US, given the First Amendment, and relatively few people with radical ideas actually turn to violence. So how do you stop radicals from committing violent acts? The White House strategy rests on a number of actions. First, by acquiring a better government-wide understanding of the scope of these threats, which can come not only from extremists motivated by white supremacism but also from, for example, anti-abortion activists, animal rights and environmental militants, and so called \u201cincel\u201d \u2013 involuntary celibate \u2013 extremists. Domestic extremists in the borderless world of the Internet are also communicating and in some cases training with extremist groups overseas. Indeed, it was for these types of reasons that the Trump administration for the first time designated an overseas white supremacist group, the Russian Imperial Movement, as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in 2020. The Biden administration also plans to designate foreign militant groups if domestic extremists are receiving support or training from them. The White House, sensibly, intends to enforce \u201clegal prohibitions that keep firearms out of dangerous hands.\u201d  The US government will make also publicly available a \u201cMobilization Indicators\u201d booklet \u201cthat will include for the first-time potential indicators of domestic terrorism\u2013related mobilization,\u201d which is the kind of information that will be useful to local law enforcement, as there is often a \u201cpathway to violence\u201d that violent extremists predictably go down, beginning with their \u201cgrievance\u201d and ending with a violent act. The government will disseminate more widely intelligence about \u201cdomestic terrorism iconography, symbology, and phraseology,\u201d since this is often closely held information by extremists. And the government will work to more strongly enforce laws already on the books prohibiting the existence of private militias. The White House asserts that the \u201c2022 Budget will include significant additional resources for the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation to ensure that they have the analysts, investigators, and prosecutors they need to thwart domestic terrorism.\u201d For its part, the Department of Defense will do more work to educate those with military training about how they might be recruited by violent extremists, and there will be better mechanisms by which veterans can \u201creport recruitment attempts by violent extremist actors.\u201d And, of course, the US government will do its best to work with the private sector to reduce the amount of online terrorist content, by providing Internet companies with information that will help them enforce their own terms of service, which prohibit terrorism-related activities on their platforms. This was also an issue when ISIS was at its height from 2015 to 2016 and when it was recruiting online many dozens of Americans to fight in Syria and Iraq or encouraging its followers to carry out lethal attacks in the United States. These are all commonsense measures which will help to reduce the scourge of domestic terrorism. Most importantly the new strategy shows that the US government has finally adopted an overall approach to counter the threat posed by the violent extremists living among us.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Stephen Richer tried to stay out of it. \u201cBut I am human,\u201d the Maricopa County, Arizona, election official wrote for CNN Opinion, \u201cI have my limits.\u201d Richer is a Republican who won his post on an unlikely platform: to make the \u201cMaricopa County Recorder\u2019s Office Boring Again,\u201d he wrote. But after the county\u2019s 2020 votes were checked and rechecked, confirming Joe Biden\u2019s victory, Arizona Senate Republicans launched a questionable \u201caudit\u201d of the ballots by a cybersecurity company. Conspiracy theorists supporting former President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless vote fraud narrative cooked up bizarre claims \u2013 of \u201cfake ballots flown in from South Korea\u201d and of a deleted election database. When Trump himself piled on with a statement repeating the lie about the missing database, Richer decided he had had enough \u2013 and tweeted, \u201cthis is unhinged.\u201d \u201cIt was time to loudly speak up to defend my name, my team\u2019s name and the county\u2019s name. It was also time to loudly speak the truth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe truth is that there is no solid evidence of significant fraud in Maricopa County\u2019s November 3 election. There is no solid evidence that the election in Maricopa County was stolen from former President Trump. That is why all eight cases brought in Arizona state and federal courts alleging widespread fraud, inaccuracies, or irregularities lost spectacularly. And yes, I believe in the court system and the rule of law.\u201d \u201cPolitics is war without bloodshed,\u201d said the Communist revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, in 1938. But the future chairman of the People\u2019s Republic of China also declared, \u201cPolitical power grows out of the barrel of a gun.\u201d With his vicious, take-no-prisoners view of politics, Mao might not be surprised at the findings of a new study conducted in the battleground state of North Carolina, where researchers reported Thursday that \u201cexposure to a stressful political election, such as the 2016 US presidential election, was associated with a 77% increase in the risk of cardiac arrhythmia in people with underlying cardiovascular disease.\u201d That election, they wrote, \u201cstands out as a historic event because of the unprecedented levels of anxiety, animosity, and partisan rhetoric throughout the campaign and the polarized reactions to the unexpected election results.\u201d But 2016 turned out to be only a prelude to the even more traumatic events that followed the 2020 election \u2013 and more than four months after the January 6 invasion of the US Capitol by former President Donald Trump\u2019s supporters, Congress still hasn\u2019t decided how to investigate it. This week, the Republican leaders of the House and Senate declared their opposition to creating a commission to investigate the riot, in which police were beaten, lawmakers cowered in fear for their lives and five people died. \u201cThe continuing effort to throw sand in the eyes of history \u2013 to gaslight the American people about what happened that day \u2013 is a thundering alarm about the future of America\u2019s democracy,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cWhen a country has just lived through a coup attempt, it should urgently, honestly, examine what occurred \u2026 Trump and many of his backers maliciously insist the election was stolen. If they have their way, the next coup attempt may not fail.\u201d Fareed Zakaria observed that \u201cthe modern Republican Party has its roots in rebellion \u2013 rebellion against the main currents of change in modern American society: the growth of the welfare state, the secularization of life and the increasing diversity of American society.\u201d Most Americans \u201cdon\u2019t agree with that protest,\u201d but GOP leaders are left \u201criding the back of a tiger and they can\u2019t get off\u201d since leaders like Trump \u201cwhip up their followers into a froth of hysteria.\u201d The result, in Zakaria\u2019s view: the party becomes \u201ca band of ideological warriors with apocalyptic vision that fears the ends of days, sees opponents as devils and traitors and believes that all methods are sanctioned in its battle to save civilization and itself.\u201d The party\u2019s former national chairman, Richard N. Bond, wrote that Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is performing \u201ca political high-wire act worthy of the legendary Flying Wallendas,\u201d as he seeks \u201cto retain the loyalty of millions of Republican voters still wedded to former President Donald Trump.

The murder conviction of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who a year ago held his knee on George Floyd\u2019s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds has only heightened the calls for justice over police killings of Black men. When Ronald Greene lost his life in 2019, Louisiana State Police told his family he died after his car hit a tree while he was fleeing officers, according to the family\u2019s lawsuit. But this week a leaked bodycam video showed \u201cofficers tasing, kicking and dragging Greene, a Black man, who is heard saying \u2018I\u2019m scared,\u2019\u201d wrote Issac Bailey. \u201cIt\u2019s just the latest in a long line of attempts by police to withhold evidence that makes them look bad or might allow victims or their families to get closer to justice.\u201d In Pasquotank County, North Carolina, the district attorney announced Tuesday that police would not be charged in the death of Andrew Brown Jr., shot by officers seeking to carry out warrants on drug charges at his home. The \u201cmessage Womble and those officers have sent to Black residents of that area in particular\u201d is clear, according to Bailey. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the guns. They\u2019ve got the badges. They\u2019ve got the backing of the entire system and can do whatever they want, even if it means filling a man\u2019s body with bullets for no good reason.\u201d There\u2019s an important lesson in the Derek Chauvin case, wrote W. Kamau Bell. \u201cDoes Chauvin get arrested or even reprimanded without the activism of Darnella Frazier, who filmed the murder and shared it with the world? Does Chauvin suffer any consequences if people all over the country don\u2019t run to the streets and ignite an international protest movement?\u201d \u201cMy answer is no. I believe Chauvin would still have his job and be abusing his power the same way he did before he murdered George Floyd, if not for the power of protest.\u201d For more on race in America: Peniel E.

The big question is what happens now \u2013 not only in the Middle East, but also in the US, where the politics of support for Israel have changed. \u201cThere are no winners in the current battle between Hamas and Israel,\u201d Dean Obeidallah wrote a week ago. \u201cIf history serves as a guide \u2026 after a ceasefire is reached, the conflict will slowly fade from the headlines, the world will go back to its business and the Palestinians will largely be forgotten \u2013 yet again. For those who sincerely want to see a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, this time must be different. The world, and especially the Biden administration, cannot look away but must engage on the question of Palestine. It\u2019s 2021 \u2013 a homeland for Palestinian Christians and Muslims is long overdue, as is safety and equality for Palestinians.\u201d  The hostilities put a spotlight on the \u201cAbraham Accords,\u201d negotiated by Trump\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner. \u201cKushner\u2019s plan was predicated on a fantasy,\u201d wrote Peter Bergen, \u201cthat peace would be achieved by negotiating without the Palestinians and instead by creating warmer relations between the Arab states and Israel. In Kushner\u2019s analysis, the road to peace in Israel ran not through Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank, but through the United Arab Emirates.\u201d Bergen added, \u201cTrump\u2019s Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin claimed that investments in the West Bank and Gaza were \u2018going to be like a hot I.P.O.,\u2019 evoking the Wall Street phrase for an initial public offering of stock. Instead of a hot I.P.O., there is now a hot war.\u201d Samuel G. Freedman noted that \u201cthe accords reinforced the notion on the right-wing in both Israel and America that somehow the century-long Palestinian national movement had all but disappeared.\u201d Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s embrace of Trump helped erode support for Israel among American Jews, Freedman wrote. \u201cBy aligning Israel with both the Republican Party and the Christian right, Netanyahu tacitly associated it with a series of positions on American domestic issues that are anathema to the preponderance of American Jews who reliably vote Democratic \u2013 outlawing abortion, rolling back gay rights, eradicating Obamacare, suppressing voting, and, of course, attempting to seize power through insurrection.\u201d In The New York Times, Thomas Friedman argued that there\u2019s a symbiotic relationship between Netanyahu, whose nickname is Bibi, and the leaders of Hamas. Israel\u2019s prime minister \u201cand Hamas each exploited or nurtured their own mobs to prevent an unprecedented national unity government from emerging in Israel \u2013 a cabinet that for the first time would have included Israeli Jews and Israeli Arab Muslims together \u2026 No, Hamas and Bibi don\u2019t talk. They don\u2019t need to. They each understand what the other needs to stay in power and consciously or unconsciously behave in ways to ensure that they deliver it.\u201d For more: David A.

But then, as Scott Jennings pointed out, Mercedes\u2019 manager Tony La Russa broke some far more important rules. \u201cLa Russa castigated his star player for making a \u2018big mistake,\u2019 promising some sort of \u2018consequence he has to endure here within our family.\u2019 La Russa may have also invited retribution from the other team \u2026\u201d The next night, a Twins pitcher threw at Mercedes\u2019 knees \u2013 and fortunately missed.

Bush in 2002, the president\u2019s party loses seats in the midterms, with an average of 27 House seats since 1946,\u201d Zelizer noted. Biden should act swiftly on his ambitious spending plans, he urged, lest he suffer the fate of Barack Obama, who was unable to enact much of his agenda after Democrats lost the House in 2010. \u201cTea party Republicans spent the rest of his presidency stifling legislative progress on key issues such as immigration and climate change and pushing the government into dangerous high-stakes showdowns on routine matters, such as funding the government and raising the debt ceiling.\u201d The clock is also ticking on Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s anticipated decision on whether to retire from the US Supreme Court while Biden might have the votes to confirm a liberal replacement who would be young enough to serve for decades. Emory University law professor Michael J. Broyde pushed back against the idea that the 82-year-old Breyer should retire. \u201cBreyer is still producing excellent work and has shown no signs of either ill health or mental decline. There is no reason for him to retire until he is unable to do his job.\u201d Biden\u2019s choice of a replacement, Broyde noted, \u201cwould have to attract the vote of every single Democrat in the Senate \u2013 from Sen. Bernie Sanders to Sen. Joe Manchin \u2013 to be confirmed along party lines. with the vice president breaking the tie. It is possible that no person would be confirmed for a while with all the problems that might produce on the court with only eight justices, six of whom have been appointed by Republican presidents.\u201d Covid-19 cases and deaths continued their steady decline, leading The New York Times\u2019 David Leonhardt to write that the pandemic is \u201cin retreat\u201d and \u201cthere is now an excellent chance that the retreat is permanent. Victory over Covid has not yet arrived, but it is growing close.\u201d Laurie Rich Salerno has spent the pandemic with her husband and two young children in West Hartford, Connecticut, reading books like \u201cThe Swiss Family Robinson,\u201d sledding, hiking, remote schooling and enjoying being together. She and her husband are vaccinated, but since Salerno has multiple sclerosis, she is concerned that her MS treatment and weakened immune system could put her at higher risk should she contract the virus that causes Covid-19. \u201cWith high vaccine rates and Covid-19 numbers falling in our state, we were starting to look forward to going back into the bookstore or out with friends,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow, with the new CDC rule saying that masking will be required only for unvaccinated people on an honor system \u2013 it feels like we\u2019re even more trapped.\u201d The more people who get vaccinated, the harder it will be for the virus to find susceptible targets. Yet Fox News host Tucker Carlson has lent his prominent platform to vaccine skepticism, Dr. Jonathan Reiner noted. \u201cWhile Carlson has posed countless uninformed and misleading questions to cast doubt on the safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, there is one question that he has not answered: Has he been vaccinated against Covid? \u2026 In a country where so many people have sacrificed so much to extinguish this brutal fire, Carlson keeps lighting matches.\u201d Jill Filipovic: Is Bill and Melinda Gates\u2019 divorce any of our business?

Diana\u2019s sons Prince William and Prince Harry spoke out against the behavior of the BBC, which also apologized. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to imagine why the BBC wasn\u2019t initially motivated to investigate further,\u201d wrote Kara Alaimo. \u201cOver 20 million people viewed the interview and we\u2019re still talking about it today. And Princess Diana is hardly the only woman whose suffering or sexuality have been manipulated by the press; members of the media have long \u2013 and disgracefully \u2013 exploited female interview subjects in order to drive up viewership, readership and clicks \u2026\u201d \u201cJust as the Diana interview generated so much fervor by casting her within the trope of a woman scorned (the line that will never die: \u2018there were three of us in this marriage,\u2019 a reference to Prince Charles\u2019s love for his now-wife, Camilla), the media pegged Britney Spears as one of the \u2018girls gone wild\u2019 it loved to expose so salaciously in the 1990s. Other such targets included Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Whitney Houston and other young women who captured public fascination.\u201d Now, Alaimo pointed out, social media \u201cgives women in the public eye \u2013 and the rest of us \u2013 powerful weapons to fight back that simply weren\u2019t available in Diana\u2019s day. We must continue to deploy them while calling out this misogynistic behavior for what it is: exploitation.\u201d",

Freedman, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of nine books, including \u201cJew vs. Jew: The Struggle for the Soul of American Jewry.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. A few weeks shy of 54 years ago, as Arab armies massed on its borders vowing extermination, Israel launched the preemptive attack that set off the Six-Day War. In that sudden transformation from looming genocide to military triumph, American Jews rallied behind the Jewish state as never before \u2013 with unprecedented cash donations and public demonstrations. The spectacle of the Diaspora\u2019s largest Jewish community mobilizing around the Jewish nation set a model to be repeated during the 1973 war and the suicide bombings of the second intifada in the early 2000s. When Israel was in trouble, American Jews spoke in a single voice. Measured by that benchmark, the response of American Jewry to Israel during its current battle with Hamas represents a striking departure. Two of the Jewish people serving in the US Senate \u2013 Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Jon Ossoff of Georgia \u2013 have taken leading roles in calling for evenhanded American policy on the Israeli-Palestinian issue and for an immediate cease fire, respectively. And the liberal Jewish lobbying group, J Street, has provided important political support for politicians, whether Jewish or not, to criticize Israel\u2019s relentless bombing of Gaza in response to Hamas\u2019 rocket attacks on Israel without the risk of being smeared as being anti-Israel or even anti-Semitic. At the level of daily Jewish life in America, experts sense a distinctly muted mood. \u201cThere\u2019s a fairly dramatic lack of urgency,\u201d Dr. Kenneth Wald, an emeritus professor of American Jewish culture and society at the University of Florida in Gainesville, told me in a telephone interview. \u201cI\u2019ve been on our local Jewish Federation board for 20-something years and nobody has jumped up and said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to run an emergency campaign for Israel.\u2019 It struck me that there\u2019s an absence of calls for mobilization. And in shul last Shabbat, our rabbi, who does not normally talk about current affairs, gave a very nuanced talk \u2013 the need for us to stop thinking about the other as the other.\u201d It would be a historical mistake to view the American Jewish stance during this war as an anomaly. Despite the surges of mass grassroots advocacy for Israel during times of existential threat, the seeds of dissent took root during what might be described as volitional conflicts like the invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the first intifada in the late 1980s. Palestinians deserve the same security, equality and right to a homeland as the Israelis Americans for Peace Now, one of the earliest hubs of American Jewish dissidence on Israeli militarism, took both its name and inspiration from the Israeli organization that led the outcry there against the Lebanon war. Then, the revelation of secret peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian delegations in the Oslo process of the early 1990s gave American Jews permission to voice support for a two-state solution without being disparaged as disloyal. And, as early as 2001, the scholar Steven T. Rosenthal was warning of the \u201cwaning of the American Jewish love affair with Israel.\u201d And this trend is started to reflect in the polling of American Jews. A newly-released survey of American Jewry by the Pew Research Center found that, as of 2020, about one in five American Jews say the US is too supportive of Israel. Meanwhile, those who say the US is not sufficiently supportive of Israel declined to 19% \u2013 down 12 points since 2013. There can be no doubt, however, that the relative estrangement accelerated due to the flagrantly divisive roles played by former President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A year before Trump won the election, Netanyahu defied the second term American President, Barack Obama, by taking an invitation from Republican leaders to denounce Obama\u2019s proposed nuclear deal with Iran before a joint session of Congress. Once in the White House, Trump essentially gave Netanyahu everything for nothing. He moved the American embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, reduced American diplomatic engagement with the Palestinian Authority \u2013 all without asking the Israeli prime minister to make genuine concessions to the Palestinians. Whatever happened to Jared Kushner's peace plan? Then the so-called Abraham Accords brokered by Trump\u2019s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner brought Israel diplomatic relations with four Muslim nations \u2013 Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Morocco \u2013 in return for the meager promise to pause new annexation in the West Bank. More treacherously still, the accords reinforced the notion on the right-wing in both Israel and America that somehow the century-long Palestinian national movement had all but disappeared. We now know how self-deluding that fantasy was. For all of Trump\u2019s seeming courtship of American Jews based on his \u201cbromance\u201d with Netanyahu, he won only about 30% of the Jewish vote in 2020 \u2013 a proportion well within the norms for Republican presidential candidates over the past 50 years. And the Pew survey found only a minority of those polled approved of Netanyahu\u2019s performance (40%) and considered Trump friendly to American Jews (31%). Which, actually, should come as no surprise. For both Trump and Netanyahu, the moderate and liberal majority of American Jews were never their real audience. Rather, it was evangelical Christians. Ron Dermer, formerly Netanyahu\u2019s ambassador to the United States, recently was caught saying the quiet part out loud at a conference hosted by the Israeli newspaper Makor Rishon: \u201cPeople have to understand that the backbone of Israel\u2019s support in the United States is the evangelical Christians. It\u2019s true because of numbers and also because of their passionate and unequivocal support for Israel.\u201d As for American Jews, not only are their numbers much smaller, he said, but they are overrepresented among Israel\u2019s critics.  By aligning Israel with both the Republican Party and the Christian right, Netanyahu tacitly associated it with a series of positions on American domestic issues that are anathema to the preponderance of American Jews who reliably vote Democratic \u2013 outlawing abortion, rolling back gay rights, eradicating Obamacare, suppressing voting, and, of course, attempting to seize power through insurrection. By turning Israel into a partisan wedge issue, and alienating many American Jews in the process, those cynical siblings \u2013 Trump and Netanyahu \u2013 ensured that when the time came for Israel to need bipartisan support and a united front of American Jews neither would be readily available anymore.Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said that Israel\u2019s Peace Now organization was founded in reaction to the Lebanon war. It was founded before the war.",

Follow him on Twitter @dougheye. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Republican Sen. Rob Portman\u2019s retirement announcement caught Washington DC by surprise. Portman, who won reelection in Ohio in 2016 by 21 points, was seemingly not on anyone\u2019s radar for potential retirement. This is bad news for Republicans. Not merely because defending an open seat is more difficult than when an incumbent, especially a popular one like Portman, is running for reelection, but also because the departure of smart conservative workhorses like Portman leaves extreme candidates more likely to win a primary. If they win, the party is changed for the worse. And if they lose, those extreme candidates still tend to define how the Republican Party is perceived. That perception reflects a longtime trend. 2010 was a great year for Republicans. They gained more than 60 seats in the US House of Representatives and six US Senate seats. But two  congressional candidates, both unsuccessful, planted the seed that Republican candidates were increasingly outlandish in their performance and beliefs. That seed grew. In Delaware, Christine O\u2019Donnell, a Tea Party-backed Republican Senate candidate, was forced to go on the defensive in an effort to explain her earlier remarks about \u201cdabbl[ing] into witchcraft.\u201d Instead of focusing her attacks on her opponent, Democrat Chris Coons, she was running an infamous ad that began, \u201cI am not a witch.\u201d Meanwhile, in Nevada, Tea Party-supported Sharron Angle emerged from a crowded GOP field only to have her campaign against a potentially beatable Democrat, Harry Reid, sidetracked with her strange claims that some American cities were governed by sharia law (Islamic religious law) and her avoidance of the press \u2013 in part, because of her odd statements. Arizona Republicans still backing Trump are on the wrong path In 2012, Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin, a candidate running against the vulnerable Democrat, Claire McCaskill, found himself on the defensive over comments about women\u2019s bodies supposedly blocking pregnancy after what he called \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d Akin apologized, but later unapologized, and McCaskill won the election by some 15 points. Akin practically had an ideological soulmate in Indiana\u2019s GOP Senate nominee, Richard Mourdock, who, in addition to questioning the constitutionality of Medicare and Social Security \u2013 popular programs among seniors, the most reliable of voting blocs \u2013 also made controversial comments about abortion. Specifically, he said God \u201cintended\u201d rape pregnancies. Though Mourdock later apologized for the \u201cmisinterpretation\u201d of his comments, the damage was done. In another blown opportunity for Republicans, Democrat Joe Donnelly won election. What these candidates all have in common is not simply costing the GOP winnable US Senate seats. It\u2019s that they began to define the party in the run up to former President Donald Trump\u2019s rise. In 2010, O\u2019Donnell became a household name and laughingstock. In 2012, Republican candidates throughout the country were taken off their messages as Democrats effectively nationalized the Akin and Mourdock comments, causing Republicans yet more problems with women voters. Four presidents take a stand While these candidates shared a willingness to stoke anger and use fiery rhetoric, they did not have Trump\u2019s command of media or ability to dominate the political conversation. Which brings us back to the Portman retirement. Along with Portman, Sens. Richard Burr and Pat Toomey are retiring in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, respectively. And Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey says he won\u2019t run for US Senate in 2022. It\u2019s possible Republicans might nominate Trump loyalists Rep. Jim Jordan to replace Portman and Lara Trump, Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law, to replace Burr. Meanwhile, the Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward, another Trump supporter, may run in the US Senate race in Arizona, in which Democrat Mark Kelly will be up for reelection. Not to mention that Trump\u2019s former press secretary, Sarah Sanders, announced Monday she was running for governor of Arkansas \u2013 and received the former president\u2019s endorsement shortly after. Win or lose \u2013 and, to be clear, Ward, who has already lost two Republican primaries, could certainly lose again \u2013 these candidates would further define the GOP as the party of Trump even as the former president\u2019s popularity has dropped following the insurrection he inspired. For the Republicans who hoped to put Trump in rear view mirror, this could spell disaster.  State parties may not care. Indeed, by attacking fellow Republicans, party officials in places like Arizona, Oregon and Virginia scare away potential moderate Republican voters who do not subscribe to Trumpism. Through censure and resolutions, these officials seek to cast out any Republican they view as not sufficiently loyal to the former President. This was misguided enough during the Trump years. Traditionally, parties have believed it is important to grow their base \u2013 not shrink it through loyalty tests. But as the GOP continues to go further down the road of tribalism, mistaking Trumpian tactics and controversy for long-term strategy, they risk further electoral and policy losses.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. During the two days before the January 6 riot in the Capitol, numerous far-right websites carried an interview with a Catholic archbishop who warned that the United States would be \u201cwiped out from history\u201d if it failed to expose \u201cnow\u201d what his interviewer called \u201cthe coordinated theft of our election.\u201d Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, the former Vatican ambassador to the United States, is a renegade cleric best known for calling for Pope Francis\u2019 resignation. He is the most prominent of a group of Catholic clergymen who joined evangelical Protestant figures in the religious wing of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement. Given the role of Catholics as a swing vote \u2014 and as 30% of the members of Congress \u2014 these far-right clerics have played an important role in supporting President Donald Trump\u2019s Big Lie that he won the 2020 presidential election. Video messages from Vigan\u00f2, Bishop Joseph Strickland of the Tyler diocese in east Texas, and the Rev. Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, were featured in the December 12 \u201cJericho March\u201d called \u201cto preserve fair and free elections in America.\u201d Vigan\u00f2\u2019s role is particularly troubling. He invokes his position as an archbishop, \u201cSuccessor of the Apostles,\u201d and former top Vatican official to claim apostolic authority to indulge in conspiracy. The claims that Vigan\u00f2, Strickland and Pavone have made were amplified through their access to a large range of conservative and far-right Catholic media such as the EWTN Global Catholic Network, and many others. Catholic bishops and other Catholic opinion-makers have mostly been slow to respond to this misuse of their faith to help Trump, in all his pride and wrath, as he tried to lie and bully his way into a second term. Divided by their own intra-church battles, their voices have been absent or tepid. The Jericho March\u2019s organizers adopted Trump\u2019s falsehood: \u201cWe will not let globalists, socialists and communists destroy our beautiful nation by sidestepping our laws and suppressing the will of the American people through their fraudulent and illegal activities in this election,\u201d its website said at the time. The march\u2019s publicity release listed Vigan\u00f2 as the headliner for that rally, along with retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former national security adviser Trump pardoned. From a jumbo video screen on the National Mall, Vigan\u00f2 said he prayed that \u201corder will triumph over destruction,\u201d telling the crowd, \u201cWe are the silent army of the children of light, the humble ranks who overthrow evil by invoking God, the praying army that walks around the walls of lies and betrayal in order to bring them down.\u201d Capitol rioters made a mockery of Christian values Bishop Strickland, filmed standing before an altar, was more restrained but still worked some of the rally\u2019s buzzwords into his prayer: \u201cWe pray in a special way for our nation in a time of darkness, confusion, this time of too much corruption and doubt.\u201d Strickland was so agitated over Biden\u2019s victory that after the US Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement with congratulations on his victory, he tweeted on Nov. 10, \u201cA dark cloud has descended on this nation when the USCCB and Planned Parenthood speak in unison in support of a Biden-Harris administration that supports the slaughter of innocents by abortion for all 9 months of pregnancy.\u201d He repeated the false claim that the bishops had somehow acted \u201cin unison\u201d with their arch-foe Planned Parenthood on November 24 in his program on LifesiteNews. Pavone sounded more like a politician as he pushed Trump\u2019s Big Lie for the December 12 rally: \u201cLord you have given President Trump victory over all these enemies and we ask you to give him and us victory once again,\u201d he said. \u201cBless his campaign as it fights voter fraud.\u201d After that event, the Jericho March organizers put together a five-day \u201cSave the Republic\u201d rally that culminated on the fateful afternoon of January 6 in a Capitol Hill meet-up with the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d crowd. For further directions, the Jericho March provided a link to wildprotest.com, according to its website at the time. Jericho March\u2019s promotional material featured a picture of Trump, pointing straight on like Uncle Sam, under the header, \u201cTake America Back.\u201d Below, it borrowed from Trump\u2019s infamous tweet, \u201cBe there, will be wild!\u201d There can be no doubt that the statements of these religious leaders helped to create the violent atmosphere that exploded on Capitol Hill. After the violence, the Jericho March has cleared away the edgy statements from its website, replacing them with a page that says, \u201cJericho March has a history of totally peaceful marches and we have not, did not, and never will condone violence or destruction.\u201d Trump's infamy will never fade As a Catholic, I cringe especially at Vigan\u00f2\u2019s actions. The \u201copen letters\u201d he issued throughout 2020 are reminiscent of the demagogic radio addresses that Father Charles Coughlin delivered in the late 1930s, filled with apocalyptic warnings about evil forces  vying for world domination. The day after November\u2019s election, Vigan\u00f2 wrote a \u201cLetter to American Catholics and Americans of Good Will.\u201d \u201cWe have seen the deep state organize itself, well in advance, to carry out the most colossal electoral fraud in history, in order to ensure the defeat of the man who has strenuously opposed the establishment of the New World Order that is wanted by the children of darkness,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn this battle, you have not failed, as is your sacred duty, to make your own contribution by taking the side of the Good. Others, enslaved by vices or blinded by infernal hatred against Our Lord, have taken the side of Evil.\u201d Though he is on the run from papal authority, the archbishop invoked his status as \u201cSuccessor of the Apostles\u201d to make statements such as this one in an October open letter to Trump: \u201cAround you are gathered with faith and courage those who consider you the final garrison against the world dictatorship.\u201d He also plays on the piety of devout Catholics by frequently invoking the Blessed Mother in support of his fantasies.  Pavone, for his part, showed no regret. At 4:33 p.m. on January 6, he tweeted, \u201cThese Democrats are hypocrites. Biden should shut up; he has no authority to talk right now. He is a fraud & he is not the president-elect. The rest of these sanctimonious, self righteous Democrats should stop complaining. They tried to steal the election & want us to accept it!\u201d His organization Priests for Life issued a statement January 13 saying it opposes violence. Bishop Strickland has hinted that he is examining his conscience, however. He declined to discuss this with me, but he tweeted on January 11, \u201cLet us stop blaming each other, yes I\u2019m a sinner & I can be foolish but I love God & I love this country.\u201d",

Houston authorities say the criminal investigation into a crowd surge that killed eight people and injured dozens more Friday evening at the Astroworld Festival at NRG Park could take weeks. The crowd of 50,000 was packed so tightly that as headliner Travis Scott took the stage, concertgoers were crushed and trampled as waves of people moved toward him. The youngest victim was just 14 years old. Scott has spoken out about the tragedy, saying he is devastated and is working to help the families of the victims. A concertgoer who was injured is suing Scott, who organized the festival, as well as entertainment company Live Nation, concert promoter Scoremore and others involved in the event. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. The House has passed the much-debated $1 trillion infrastructure bill after months of tense negotiation and despite pushback from progressives. The bill already passed the Senate in August. Once President Biden signs it, federal money will soon flow to repair the country\u2019s potholed roads, aging airports, crumbling bridges and antiquated railroads, with more funds targeting rural broadband and earmarked to catalyze a fast evolution of electric vehicles. Experts consider the bill\u2019s passage a big win for Biden after a week of disappointing returns for Democrats in several state elections. It is less of a win for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which tried to delay the vote until the Senate passed the massive spending package. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. The US is opening its doors to vaccinated international travelers today after 20 months of restrictions. While this is an important step in the gradual recovery of airline business, industry leaders warn things could be a little sloppy at first, with long lines and wait times as international flights fill back up. Meanwhile, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the Biden administration\u2019s new vaccine mandate for private businesses with 100 or more employees, health care workers and federal contractors. The White House chief of staff says he\u2019s confident the courts will uphold the rule before January 4, when it is due to take effect. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s administration has signed agreements with 20 unions to reaffirm the city\u2019s vaccine mandate \u2013 but not with the police or fire departments\u2019 unions. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Suspected foreign hackers have breached nine organizations in the defense, energy, health care, technology and education sectors, including at least one organization in the US. This is the conclusion of findings that security firm Palo Alto Networks shared exclusively with CNN. A senior executive of the firm said the confirmed victims are the \u201ctip of the spear\u201d of the apparent spying campaign, and more victims are expected to emerge. While it\u2019s unclear who is responsible for the activity, some of the attackers\u2019 tactics and tools reportedly overlap with those used by a suspected Chinese hacking group. The National Security Agency and other federal units have been working with cybersecurity experts to track down hackers trying steal key data from US defense contractors and other sensitive targets. Federal officials told CNN this revelation of hacking activity is evidence of their work to stay on top of threats. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. Protests broke out across the world this weekend in reaction to Nicaragua\u2019s fraught presidential election. President Daniel Ortega has received international condemnation for eliminating dissent and quashing competition in the run-up to his reelection bid. Dozens of opposition figures, including seven presidential candidates, have been arrested in Nicaragua in the past few months. At least 20 more people were arrested Saturday, a day before the election. While the Nicaraguan government spoke highly of voter turnout, some citizens called voting a \u201cjoke\u201d and said others were afraid to even leave their houses to cast a ballot. Biden called the election a \u201csham\u201d and a \u201cpantomime\u201d and said the international community would work to support the Nicaraguan people until a functioning democracy is restored. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) US diplomats in Kabul warned American citizens early this morning to immediately leave several gates into the airport following what one US official called a \u201cvery specific threat stream\u201d from a branch of ISIS. The US believes ISIS-K, a sworn enemy of the Taliban, wants to sow mayhem at the airport and is capable of carrying out attacks. The Taliban\u2019s new rule in Afghanistan has raised fears of a revival of al Qaeda, ISIS and other terrorist entities. In a February deal with the US, the Taliban pledged to prevent al Qaeda and other terror groups from using Afghan soil. Though the Taliban has so far kept such terrorist entities at bay, US officials worry now that the US is on its way out, there is less incentive for such efforts. The dissolution of US intelligence on the ground in Afghanistan makes this possibility even more grave. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Moderna has completed its submission to the FDA for full approval of its Covid-19 vaccine for people 18 and older. Meanwhile, Pfizer and BioNTech have begun submitting data for full approval of a third \u201cbooster\u201d dose of their vaccine. As expected, full FDA approval of the two-dose Pfizer vaccine is leading to more mandates. The Pentagon is\u00a0requiring all US military service members to get fully vaccinated against Covid-19 immediately. Disney World also reached a deal with two employees unions to require vaccinations among applicable staff. In a worrying turn, some people have been ingesting ivermectin, a drug used to de-worm livestock, as a treatment for Covid-19. Some hospitals and poison control centers have seen an uptick in such cases as some Republican elected officials and conservative media figures irresponsibly tout the drug. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. The House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot has demanded a large collection of documents from several US government agencies. The wide-ranging requests cover communications related to former President Trump\u2019s family members and any communications between Trump or his allies and \u201cany DOJ official\u201d in the days before and after January 6. The committee has also requested information from the National Archives, which houses all of Trump\u2019s records from his time as president. Trump yesterday said he would invoke executive privilege to try to block the investigation but didn\u2019t specify how he would go about that. Ultimately, Trump could try to go to court to stop the committee from obtaining some of these documents. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty.

The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Search and rescue efforts have been suspended in Tennessee following a weekend of destructive floods that claimed 20 lives. Now, it\u2019s up to the National Guard and the state Transportation Department to begin massive cleanup efforts. In the West, the region around Lake Tahoe in California and Reno, Nevada, is experiencing the worst air quality in the country by far as several large wildfires burn nearby. The Air Quality Index, an indicator of how unhealthy the air is, spiked to 694 in Tahoe City on Monday; an AQI between 300 and 500 is considered \u201ca health warning of emergency conditions.\u201d As if that weren\u2019t enough, more hurricane activity could happen around the Gulf of Mexico soon. The National Hurricane Center gives the Gulf area an 80% chance of a tropical system developing in the next few days. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. Hong Kong\u2019s national security police are investigating the group behind the city\u2019s annual June 4 vigil, which commemorates pro-democracy protesters who died in the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre. As part of the investigation, the group must submit meeting records and personal details of all its directors and members, including addresses and other contact information. Police claimed such information will help them investigate possible crimes against national security. The group, the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, has reportedly considered disbanding under the city\u2019s controversial new security law as more protesters, journalists and pro-democracy figures have been arrested. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system.

(You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The sweeping voting rights bill championed by Democrats failed to advance in the Senate yesterday after a dead-even 50-50 vote, falling short of the 60 votes needed to move it forward. This wasn\u2019t too much of a surprise, since Senate Republicans signaled they wouldn\u2019t support it. Still, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called Republicans\u2019 united block of the bill \u201cindefensible\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d The bill aimed to counter efforts by GOP-led state legislatures to pass restrictive voting laws after the 2020 presidential election. Now, Democrats will take on the issue from other angles. The Senate Rules Committee plans to hold a series of hearings, including in Georgia, calling for passage of new legislation. Dems also may look to push the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, a different bill that shores up provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Violent crime is on the rise in cities across the US, and the White House has listened with alarm as local authorities warn of an even deadlier summer. President Biden\u00a0is due to address the spike in shootings, armed robberies and assaults today after a meeting with state and local officials, law enforcement representatives and other experts. The Biden administration hopes to come up with a comprehensive crime reduction plan to curtail any Republican efforts to use the spike as a reason to run to a \u201claw and order\u201d campaign during next year\u2019s midterm elections. Major American cities saw a 33% increase in homicides last year alone. Some police officers say they\u2019re worried about increased scrutiny of their profession and how it will affect police responses to the predicted rise in violence. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Experts now say that dangerous Delta variant could cause a full-on resurgence of coronavirus in the US in the coming months. The most recent model finds that a highly contagious variant, even coupled with 75% of eligible Americans getting vaccinated, could result in more than 3,000 Covid-19 deaths per week at various points during the fall and winter \u2013 a huge increase over recent summer lows. And a 75% vaccination rate is a far-off dream right now. The country will likely fall short of Biden\u2019s goal of a 70% partial vaccination rate among adults by July 4. College students and workers around the country are also starting to balk at vaccine requirements set by their schools or employers. Apple Daily, Hong Kong\u2019s biggest pro-democracy newspaper, has announced it will close after several of its journalists were arrested and millions of dollars in assets frozen. The closure is the latest consequence of the national security law imposed last year by Beijing, and it has sent a deep chill through Hong Kong\u2019s media industry. The law punishes anything the authorities deem to be subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. While Hong Kong\u2019s leaders assured that press freedom would be protected, for many journalists in the region, a closure like this seemed all but inevitable. Since the law took effect, Apple Daily\u2019s founder has been arrested and charged with collusion, police officers have twice raided the publication\u2019s newsroom and its bank accounts were recently frozen. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria.

Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. It\u2019s been five years since the UK\u2019s Brexit vote sent shockwaves across the globe and put the country on a divisive and rocky path out of the European Union. Many of those divisions remain, including tensions with Northern Ireland and an ongoing independence push by Scotland, which voted overwhelmingly against Brexit. Meanwhile, the UK government has begun talks on joining a Pacific trade partnership that it sees as one of its biggest opportunities to forge economic alliances beyond Europe after Brexit. However, trade experts say such alliances will yield only modest economic benefits and won\u2019t make up for the hit to Britain\u2019s trade caused by its break from the European Union.

            "article_content": "In her Ohio hometown, she\u2019s known as an Army veteran who runs a bar and set up a small\u202fself-styled militia\u202fher boyfriend says she created to help neighbors if tornadoes hit. To the FBI, she\u2019s a\u202fmilitant leader who traveled to Washington, DC, and stormed the US Capitol, encouraging\u202fothers to do the same. The two worlds of Jessica Watkins crashed into each other in the\u202fsmall\u202fvillage of Woodstock, Ohio, when FBI agents turned up early one morning to arrest her for her alleged role in the January\u202f6\u202finsurrection. \u201cWe could hear so many sirens. And then we heard them yelling for her to come downstairs with her hands up and she did not,\u201d said Emma Dixon, who witnessed the pre-dawn raid from a home across the street. Watkins was seen on video taking part in the insurrection that is linked to the deaths of five people and that terrified lawmakers, who were forced to run to hiding places, fearing for their lives. When the FBI arrived in Woodstock, Watkins was not there. Her boyfriend, Montana Siniff was. He told CNN disorientating flash-bangs were used.\u202f\u202fA window was broken. It remained that way days later. FBI agents\u202fquestioned him and eventually\u202fleft, he said. In a complaint filed in court, federal prosecutors said agents\u202frecovered what \u201cappears to be directions for making explosives, authored by \u2018the Jolly Roger.\u2019\u201d Jolly Roger is also the name of Watkins\u2019 bar and a Facebook account believed to be linked to her, authorities say. \u201cThat is entirely false. She hates explosives. There is no moral or lawful way to really make use of explosives as a regular citizen,\u201d Siniff said. Watkins, 38,\u202fis now detained at the Montgomery County Jail, about 50 miles away in Dayton,\u202fafter she handed herself in to authorities last Sunday. Records show Watkins served in the Army under a different name from April 2001 to December 2003. She was deployed to Afghanistan from September to December 2002. Watkins is accused, along with two other military veterans, of\u202fa multitude of charges: conspiracy,\u202fconspiracy to impede an officer, destruction of government property, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering a restricted building or grounds without lawful authority, and violent entry or disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. The\u202fthree veterans were the first\u202fto face conspiracy charges, some of the most severe charges so far for those who breached the Capitol on January 6. CNN has found a disproportionate number of people charged in the Capitol attack are former members of the military. No one disputes that Watkins went to the Capitol to protest against the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election win.\u202fShe is seen on video bragging about it while inside the Capitol building. Her boyfriend said she went to \u201chelp protect some Trump VIP members within the rally,\u201d but he did not know whom. After breaching the Capitol, Watkins described the scene inside the building as she saw it. She told the Ohio Capital Journal: \u201cTo me, it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw until we started hearing glass smash. That\u2019s when we knew things had gotten really bad.\u201d She added: \u201cIt was some people hijacking what started off as a peaceful movement.\u201d But the words on her Parler account after the breach offer a very different perspective. They are highlighted in the federal complaint against her. \u201cYeah. We stormed the Capitol today. Teargassed, the whole, 9. Pushed our way into the Rotunda. Made it into the Senate even,\u201d she wrote. Another post from Watkins\u202fused as evidence\u202fby the FBI said: \u201cWe never smashed anything, stole anything, burned anything, and truthfully we were very respectful with Capitol Hill PD until they attacked us.\u202f Then we stood our ground and drew the line.\u201d They swore to protect America. Some also joined the riot Watkins and many others came to Washington trained in warfare, some wearing their combat gear of ballistic helmets, Army fatigues and goggles. Videos showed one group of more than a dozen people, in formation, hands on each other\u2019s shoulders, marching up the Capitol steps. Federal prosecutors say Watkins and others used the Zello phone app, which works like a walkie-talkie, to communicate and plan the assault. Watkins has yet to have an attorney assigned to her. But her boyfriend did talk on her behalf. The two own the Jolly Roger bar together. They are both members of the group she \u201ccommanded\u201d called the\u202fOhio State Regular Militia. \u201cShe\u2019s not a violent person,\u201d Siniff told CNN. \u201cShe can be very spirited, but she is a very good person at heart and she just really wants to try to help people.\u201d But law enforcement and many of the lawmakers inside say the rioters that breached the Capitol put lives in danger. Siniff said Watkins formed the militia to help victims of tornadoes when local authorities were absent or overwhelmed. There\u2019s a long history of paramilitary groups setting themselves up in rural areas of Ohio, Michigan and elsewhere,\u202fand\u202fthe FBI says sometimes there is a darker side. Decoding the extremist symbols and groups at the Capitol Hill insurrection Watkins is a member of the Oath Keepers, a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country. There is no private citizen militia that exists in the US. A militia has to be sanctioned by the state. The Oath Keepers are clear that they try to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders and\u202f police, and its name refers to the oath taken to \u201cdefend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\u201d In court documents the FBI says, \u201cOath Keepers will violate federal law if they believe their cause is just.\u201d Watkins\u2019 alleged co-conspirators are named by the FBI as Donovan Crowl, a former Marine, and Thomas Caldwell, who served in the Navy. Crowl lives just down the street from Watkins\u2019 Jolly Roger bar and was a regular there. Neighbors told CNN that Watkins would try to recruit people when they came into the bar. Most didn\u2019t take her up on it. But Crowl did join Watkins and Siniff in their armed group. \u201cWhen drunk, he\u2019s the guy you want to shut up. \u202fWhen sober the best man you could have,\u201d Siniff said of the former Marine. \u201cThe militia was a good thing to help him \u2026 like it was a reason to be sober.\u201d CNN has reached out to Crowl\u2019s attorney but has not received a response. Crowl\u2019s criminal record shows charges for domestic abuse and drunk driving, some of which resulted in conviction. This was noted by the federal judge when his attorney tried to get him released before his trial. His attorney said he merited release as he was not a danger to society. \u201cHe\u2019s seen on video saying, \u2018we overran the Capitol,\u2019 his criminal history includes violence and alcohol offenses, he also demonstrated prior non-compliance.\u202fThe suggestion to release him to a residence with nine firearms is a non-starter,\u201d Judge Sharon Ovington said. Crowl was remanded back into custody awaiting a preliminary hearing in Ohio. Crowl\u2019s mother, Teresa Joann Rowe,\u202ftold CNN her son has expressed increasingly hostile political views\u202fin recent years. \u201cIt felt like he did a 180-degree turnaround, felt like the world owed him a living and had a big chip on his shoulder,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because life didn\u2019t go the way he planned.\u201d Asked why she thinks Crowl may have been drawn to this extremist group, she said, \u201cI would like to understand myself. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d Caldwell, the third veteran named as a co-conspirator, lives in a secluded property down a country road in Berryville, Virginia, 400 miles from the Woodstock homes of Watkins and Crowl. It is unclear how long Caldwell knew Crowl and Watkins.\u202f But the FBI says they met up in Washington, DC.  Crowl took video of himself and Watkins inside the Capitol and posted it on social media. Outside the Capitol Caldwell made his feelings clear on January 6. \u201cEveryone single b**** in there is a traitor, every single one,\u201d he screamed in a video, appearing to refer to the legislators inside. Capitol riot dilemma: Which rioters should stay behind bars before trial? Caldwell was a name in his local Virginia political circles. He was a delegate to the Clarke County, Virginia, Republican convention last year. A lawyer temporarily assigned to Caldwell said at a detention hearing that his opposition to Biden\u2019s election win was not out of the ordinary, and that he was not accused of a violent crime. But the judge disagreed: \u201cThe conduct and statements of Mr. Caldwell and the others, it really is just pure lawlessness,\u201d Magistrate Judge Joel Hoppe of the federal court in Harrisonburg, Virginia, said on Tuesday. The village of Woodstock is home to about 300 people. Many of the homes are clustered around the crossroads, and the only traffic signal still fly \u201cTrump 2020\u201d banners. There is also the \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d or Gadsden flag of the American Revolution and a Stars and Stripes being flown upside down \u2013 a signal of \u201cdire distress,\u201d according to the US code. Some of the villagers were hostile to our CNN crew, calling the local sheriff to complain twice. Others were happier to talk and argued with their neighbors to back off. And even after all the video and social media posts showing Watkins ranting about storming the Capitol, Watkins\u2019s boyfriend defends her. \u201cI do not believe the charges of conspiracy are\u202fat all fair,\u201d Siniff said.

            "article_content": "The Omicron winter is coming. The ravenously infectious variant expected to become the dominant strain of Covid-19 in the US within weeks threatens to deal another blow to the morale and resolve of a nation already reeling under an assault by its viral Delta cousin. \u201cIt\u2019s here now and it\u2019s spreading and it\u2019s going to increase,\u201d President Joe Biden warned Thursday, girding for another battle with a pathogen that is defining his presidency and further clouding Democratic hopes for the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cFor the unvaccinated, we are looking at a winter of severe illness and death for the unvaccinated \u2013 for themselves, their families and the hospitals they\u2019ll soon overwhelm.\u201d Biden\u2019s striking language was followed by an even more alarming scenario painted by Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. Biden warns of winter of 'severe illness and death' for unvaccinated due to Omicron \u201cI think we\u2019re really just about to experience a viral blizzard,\u201d Osterholm told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cI think in the next three to eight weeks, we\u2019re going to see millions of Americans are going to be infected with this virus, and that will be overlaid on top of Delta, and we\u2019re not yet sure exactly how that\u2019s going to work out.\u201d It is not all bad news for all Americans, however. This is not 2020. While the new variant is likely to cause more breakthrough infections, vaccines \u2013 when combined with boosters \u2013 still appear to offer high protection against severe disease with Omicron, as well as against Delta, which is still the major viral troublemaker. And while the current Delta wave is triggering a flurry of college shutdowns and shuttered Broadway shows, the fear of more online school, and canceled pro-sports games are an inconvenience, most Americans who got their shots are far safer than they were before. But another wave of infections, hospitalizations and deaths fueled by a new variant, especially among the unvaccinated, would still represent another blaring crisis for a White House already beaten down by a year-long battle with a pandemic that Biden vowed as a candidate to end. A fresh assault from a virus with an uncanny ability to expose the nation\u2019s divides will open new schisms over masking, vaccine mandates and school closures \u2013 and offer new openings for politicians looking to make a mark for themselves. But with the worst public health crisis in 100 years about to enter its third year, an Omicron surge will not simply be a replay of the awful Groundhog Day of cascading misery that has unfolded since March 2020. There are increasingly profound and delicate questions about how long the country can bear the privations of ruined family lives, throttled schooling and punishing economic consequences that come with precautions designed to fight the coronavirus. Omicron is coming but boosters should fight it, federal health officials say Biden\u2019s mantra was that he would always put science first, following a first year of the pandemic that was disastrously managed by then-President Donald Trump. But do social, economic and emotional consequences that are piling up, nationally and for individuals, make it incumbent on Biden to at least consider a modified approach? When does the moment come when Covid-19 must be considered an endemic threat with which Americans must live in perpetuity? What level of sickness and death is a polarized country prepared to accept in a return to some version of normality? There are still no definitive studies about the character of the variant. But if the preliminary suggestions about Omicron symptoms being more mild are borne out by experience and scientific data, what justification is there for treating the disease differently than influenza or the common cold? But with infections spiking even before Omicron\u2019s arrival and at a moment when 1,300 Americans a day are still being lost to the disease and tens of millions of people are still risking death by refusing inoculation, even raising these questions risks whipping up a furor. Covid-19 vaccinations began a year ago. These numbers show how it's going And if there is one lesson of the last two years, it is that the virus itself defies all political and human timetables and attempts by leaders to chart an exit from the crisis. For example, in July, Biden said at a July Fourth party on the White House lawn that the country had never been closer to beating the pandemic. But Delta had already dug in for an assault that brought a summer of sickness and death. Even a few weeks ago, booster shots were seemingly set to conquer Delta among those who wanted them. But then the world was set back on its heels yet again by the discovery of Omicron in South Africa. If the United States benefited from a White House that had proven its ability to outpace the virus\u2019 twists and turns, was blessed by an opposition Republican Party that put public health before politics and had a majority populace prone to trust its leaders, the next stage of the pandemic might prove less onerous. But in the absence of all that, it\u2019s likely that the coming new bout with the disease will be as politically and socially painful as previous engagements. That the new variant is arriving in time for a bitter midterm election year will hardly help. Preparing for a Delta/Omicron double surge Even if Omicron is more mild, it could still land vast numbers of Americans in hospitals and cause many deaths \u2013 by virtue of the volume of infection. And even if most Americans suffer only mild symptoms, the increased contagiousness of the variant compared to Delta means that many more people will test positive. Currently, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises people who test positive to isolate for 10 days. If millions of Americans suddenly become infected, the new variant could cause chaos. Parents will worry that lessons will go back online if teachers have to stay home \u2013 triggering shockwaves in the economy since many parents of young kids have no other source of child care. If lots of people become infected and have to isolate, it could cause disruption for staffing in transport, shipping, retail and possibly even emergency services. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College, said on Thursday he was especially concerned about Omicron\u2019s impact on health care workers. Doctors and nurses have spent agonizing months on the Covid frontlines. Many are suffering exhaustion, extreme stress and in some cases are leaving the profession. Since they were among the first to receive booster shots, it\u2019s possible their immunity is already waning, even if the three-dose regime does offer around 75% protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron. Hotez weighed in on the idea of a second booster shot for this community. \u201cAll of this needs to be put on the table,\u201d Hotez said. Osterholm added: \u201cI\u2019ve been very concerned about the fact that we could easily see a quarter or a third of our health care workers quickly becoming cases themselves.\u201d CDC recommends Pfizer, Moderna vaccines over J&J's Such questions will pile even more pressure on top of public health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci, who have battled Covid since the start and have been battered by the country\u2019s bitter political feuds. It also will further stretch a White House that has looked outmatched in recent weeks by a cluster of political crises, with Biden acknowledging Thursday that Democrats will miss their Christmas deadline to pass his signature economic and climate package as negotiations continue. There is no doubt that Omicron\u2019s arrival represents another political cataclysm for Biden. Apart from being rattled by the virus, his whole presidency has suffered in recent months from the stalling of his agenda in Congress, soaring inflation, high gas prices and a debacle in Afghanistan. CNN Poll: Most say government is doing too little to fix inflation and the supply chain There has been modest progress in unpicking a supply chain crunch caused by Covid infections in manufacturing hubs overseas and shortages of truckers and port space in the US. And weekly jobless claims are lower than they\u2019ve been for more than 50 years. But that could all change if the economy is thrown into reverse by new lockdowns, or simply by Americans wary of the virus staying home from restaurants, shops and avoiding travel. Even a tussle with Omicron that lasts only into early spring could further sour an acidic mood that seems likely to punish incumbents and inflict an even more devastating blow on Biden in the midterms than history warns all first-term presidents to expect. For now, however, Biden must steel citizens for another dark encounter with a virus that has changed the character of their lives. Most immediately, difficult questions lie ahead about how to gather in the holiday season amid fading hopes that this year\u2019s festivities will actually be \u2026 festive. \u201cIf we\u2019re all going to get together, we should all be vaccinated, and \u2026 boosted,\u201d Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University, told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota Thursday. \u201cWe should wear our masks if we\u2019re uncertain, and another thing we could do is we could all get tested the morning of our getting together,\u201d he said. \u201cI would recommend that we hang our stockings with care.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maggie Fox contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The message from Capitol Hill on Wednesday night was clear. Nearly two years after the pandemic began, with a new coronavirus variant sweeping the US, the search for bipartisan political consensus on the way forward continues, with no end in sight. In a rebuke of one of President Joe Biden\u2019s central efforts to combat Covid-19, a slim Senate majority voted to overturn his vaccine mandate for businesses. Two Democrats from conservative states, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Jon Tester of Montana, joined Republicans, led by Indiana Sen. Mike Braun, in seeking to reverse the requirement. The change will not become law, given its uncertain status in the House and the promise of a veto from the White House. But the bipartisan vote, albeit narrow, reflects a nation still at odds about how to finally escape the pandemic, despite clear public health guidance that more widespread vaccine uptake is key. Biden entered office with a clear promise about the pandemic: to deliver a coherent strategy for beating it back and, as he often said on the 2020 campaign trail, to always \u201cfollow the science\u201d in that pursuit. The reality has been more complicated. Mounting evidence highlights the importance of Covid-19 boosters And for a country devastated on so many fronts by the pandemic, the administration\u2019s shifting messages \u2013 sometimes necessary; occasionally delayed or in error \u2013 have been all the more vexing. The challenge has been made vastly more complicated by Republican Party leaders, especially in the states, working overtime to turn measures intended to combat the virus into political wedge issues and discourage simple and effective mitigation efforts, from masks to vaccine requirements. \u201cI\u2019ve seen more of Dr. (Anthony) Fauci than my wife,\u201d Biden joked last week, referring to his chief medical adviser during a speech about his plan for the coming months. As he spelled out a series of initiatives, the President acknowledged the man-made obstacles in his path. \u201cCovid-19 has been very divisive in this country. It\u2019s become a political issue, which is a sad, sad commentary,\u201d he added. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be, but it has been.\u201d Biden asked Americans to put that \u201cdivisiveness\u201d behind them, but just as with conquering the virus, there is little to suggest his wish will be realized. On Tuesday night, those divisions were in stark display in the Senate. A day before the vote on Biden\u2019s vaccine requirements, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, slammed Republicans over their work to undermine the Biden directive, unveiled in September, that called on the Labor Department to require businesses with 100 or more employees to mandate their workers either be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing for Covid-19. The emergency rule was issued last month, setting off a torrent of lawsuits from Republican-led states, private employers and even some liberal-leaning unions before it was supposed to take effect in January. After a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the vaccine rules, multiple lawsuits were consolidated and reassigned to a conservative-leaning federal appeals court in Ohio, with many expecting the case to end up before the US Supreme Court. Biden federal contractor vaccine mandate blocked nationwide by federal judge in Georgia \u201cIf their plans go into effect, Covid will linger longer and the chance of new variants and new more dangerous variants occurring increases,\u201d Schumer said of Republicans. \u201cIt is anti-science, anti-common sense. It makes no sense.\u201d Some GOP senators insisted their resistance to Biden\u2019s mandate was rooted in their opposition to compelling private citizens to get the shots. \u201cThis is not about being anti-vaccine,\u201d said Sen. Steve Daines of Montana. \u201cI was part of the Pfizer trial. I am pro-science, pro-vaccine, but I\u2019m anti-mandate.\u201d Now, as cases of the omicron variant spread across the US, the country is increasingly also contending with a dangerous and distressing strain of uncertainty. Its tentacles touch almost every part of American life, from gas prices and supply chain issues to difficult questions over what level of vaccination \u2013 for those who\u2019ve already sought and received two shots \u2013 is sufficient to protect them from a virus that has now killed nearly 800,000 Americans and more than 5 million people worldwide. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on CNN Wednesday that his opinion is it\u2019s a matter of when, not if, the definition of fully vaccinated will change to include three doses of Covid-19 vaccine \u2013 but that he wants everyone to get a third shot regardless. The Covid-19 vaccination map looks almost exactly like the election map \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would argue that optimal protection is going to be with a third shot,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cIt\u2019s a technical, almost semantic definition, and it is the definition for requirements.\u201d As a matter of both policy and personal understanding, the prospect of new guidance is \u2013 recent history strongly suggests \u2013 going to fuel existing frustration and resentment, especially among GOP partisans. A recent analysis by the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation underscored the depths of the rift between Democrats and Republicans on vaccines \u2013 though, perhaps more than any other, the issue offers a broader representation of the messy landscape. The foundation reported last month that \u201cpartisanship is now the strongest self-identifying predictor of being unvaccinated.\u201d And in an analysis it published at the beginning of December, the authors said, \u201cFour in ten Republicans remain unvaccinated and smaller shares of vaccinated Republicans \u2013 especially older Republicans \u2013 report receiving a booster dose.\u201d Overall, the number of fully vaccinated Americans to receive a booster, or additional dose, currently stands at about 49 million, according to US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. That amounts to a little more than a quarter of fully vaccinated adults overall and less than 50% of fully vaccinated seniors. The pace of vaccinations does appear to be speeding up over the past month, with a seven-day average of nearly 500,000 Americans initiating vaccinations and an average of about 1.9 million shots being administered each day. Nearly a million of those are boosters. But with nearly a quarter of the eligible population still unvaccinated, the pandemic is again throwing the political world for a loop \u2013 adding another unwelcome dose of debate and ambiguity to the social terminology around vaccination. When it became clear earlier in the day on Wednesday that Biden\u2019s vaccine requirement for businesses would face a rebuke in the Senate, the Republican super PAC America Rising pounced, releasing a batch of recent comments from a pair of Democratic governors, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Laura Kelly of Kansas, along with Manchin and Tester, expressing either trepidation or opposition about certain vaccine mandates. Biden's path out of the pandemic meets a Republican blockade \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s failed agenda created the economic hardship Americans are facing right now, and a vaccine mandate would only further exacerbate the problem,\u201d America Rising PAC press secretary Whitney Robertson said in a statement. \u201cEven notable members of his own party are refusing to sign their names to such a terrible idea.\u201d Meanwhile, during a week when Congress zigged, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio zagged, surprising the public with an announcement that the city would \u2013 over the Democrat\u2019s final month in office \u2013 adopt a \u201cfirst-in-the-nation vaccine mandate for private-sector workers.\u201d The rule takes effect on December 27 and will \u201capply to roughly 184,000 businesses,\u201d his office said. The new regulation is likely destined for a courtroom. It has set off a mixture of outright opposition and anger over what many perceive as yet another life-altering decision taken without much public debate. Already, a preexisting requirement for municipal workers is headed back to court next week after a judge on Tuesday set a date for new arguments over a New York City Police Department detective\u2019s request to halt a municipal mandate. The political and legal battles ahead come as case numbers in the city and state are on the rise and just before the peak of the holiday travel season. This week has, so far, brought a welcome bit of mostly good news for Biden on a few fronts, including with gas prices trending down, supply chain snags decreasing and early data from Pfizer and BioNTech that a third dose of the vaccine can improve protection against the Omicron variant. But relief does not necessarily translate to confidence, a political conundrum for the Biden White House as it seeks to navigate its first Covid-era winter. A new poll from Monmouth University on Wednesday underscored the topsy-turvy political environment. Two-thirds of respondents said the country was on the wrong track, about the same as the last two months, but up from 50% in April. Covid-19 ranked as the top worry among respondents, at 18%, just ahead of \u201cEveryday bills, groceries, etc.\u201d (15%) and inflation (14%). The latter two issues, as Monmouth University Polling Institute director Patrick Murray pointed out, are intricately connected, adding that \u201cas one would expect, many are placing the blame squarely on Washington.\u201d Reasons for optimism: Omicron, gas prices and inflation The reality is that all three, and a number of concerns further down the line, are deeply intertwined even if Americans and their political leaders perceive them as distinct dangers or frustrations. With the midterm election season on the horizon, the pull of holistic messaging will be even weaker, as both parties seek out winning issues they can narrowcast to the voters who will decide control of Congress, governors\u2019 races and state legislative contests. There was, however, some bracing news for the administration and many Democrats in the poll, which showed that support for Biden\u2019s Build Back Better legislation, which addresses paid leave, child and elder care, health care, college, climate change and more, remains robust. (This despite its uncertain fate in Congress after passing the House but facing a tough road ahead in the Senate.) The bipartisan infrastructure deal passed by both chambers and signed by Biden is also immensely popular, with 66% of Americans approving of it. Biden\u2019s chief of staff retweeted a short summary of the Monmouth poll\u2019s approving verdict on the Democratic legislative agenda. And in Missouri, where he spent the day selling the bipartisan package, Biden took a little jab at his predecessor amid a rare victory lap. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could take one more phrase that it\u2019s going to be \u2018infrastructure week,\u2019\u201d Biden said to applause at the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority. \u201cGuess what? It\u2019s going to be infrastructure decade now, man.\u201d Whether or not the law he was celebrating remains popular and succeeds in its ambitions, it seems unlikely that this young, deeply troubled decade will be so easily labeled.",

            "article_content": "Two lawyers who went to court to claim voter fraud after the 2020 election must pay nearly $180,000 to the defendants they sued, a federal magistrate judge ordered Monday, saying their lawsuit aimed to \u201cmanipulate gullible members of the public and foment public unrest.\u201d The order from Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter of the US District Court in Colorado adds to the federal judiciary\u2019s condemnations of attempts by attorneys supporting then-President Donald Trump to use the courts to vet right-wing conspiracies in the days after the presidential election. Attorneys Gary D. Fielder and Ernest John Walker will have to pay attorneys fees of $50,000 to Facebook (now Meta), about $63,000 to Dominion Voting Systems, about $63,000 to the non-profit Center for Tech and Civic Life, more than $6,000 to the state of Pennsylvania and nearly $5,000 to the state of Michigan. \u201cThey need to take responsibility for their misconduct,\u201d Neureiter wrote in his order, adding that the lawsuit defamed the defendants. Federal and state officials investigate attempted breach of Ohio county office after data appears at 'Big Lie' symposium He continued: \u201cI believe that rather than a legitimate use of the legal system to seek redress for redressable grievances, this lawsuit has been used to manipulate gullible members of the public and foment public unrest. To that extent, this lawsuit has been an abuse of the legal system and an interference with the machinery of government. For all these reasons, I feel that a significant sanctions award is merited.\u201d The lawsuit from late December 2020 was an attempt to create a class action challenge to the election on behalf of American voters, including eight named plaintiffs. Neureiter previously wrote a scathing 68-page opinion condemning the post-election lawsuit. The plaintiffs had no lawyers or experts that were able to support their claims of switched votes and government conspiracies, the judge noted, calling the lawsuit itself \u201cone enormous conspiracy theory.\u201d Neureiter\u2019s earlier ruling was the first major consequence in federal court to befall lawyers and litigants who pushed Trump\u2019s attempt to undermine the 2020 election result in court. Other courts are still considering penalties for other lawyers involved in the failed pro-Trump lawsuits. In August, a federal judge in Michigan sanctioned pro-Trump lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, as well as several other attorneys, ordering them to reimburse the attorneys\u2019 fees that the city of Detroit and Michigan state officials paid in seeking the sanctions. The judge said the lawyers, who worked on Trump-aligned lawsuits seeking to challenge election results, had \u201cengaged in litigation practices\u201d that were \u201cabusive and, in turn, sanctionable.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Three days after his acquittal in a polarizing case in Wisconsin, Kyle Rittenhouse is now a teenaged avatar for a nation divided over the nature of justice, the societal role of guns and violence in political discourse. The sight of Rittenhouse, 18, walking free on Friday after shooting dead two men and wounding another last year in unrest sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, also opened a fresh debate over state laws on self-defense and the concept of vigilantism. The case\u2019s political reverberations are already rocking a tense political environment ahead of 2022 elections and even the 2024 presidential race. Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, for instance, thaat the incident in the city of Kenosha shows Americans must not be allowed \u201cweapons designed for battlefield use.\u201d Meanwhile, ex-President Donald Trump, who appears to be preparing another run for the White House, has been praising Rittenhouse, who inserted himself into a volatile situation, as the \u201cposter boy\u201d for the right to self-defense. Rittenhouse protesters shut down the Brooklyn Bridge. Portland demonstrators force open jail The debate on Sunday talk shows and elsewhere about Rittenhouse came hours before an SUV plowed into a holiday parade in Waukesha, Wisconsin, striking more than 20 people. Officials said multiple people were killed but gave no exact figures as relatives of those lost are notified. Police gave no details on the motives of the attack but said they had a person of interest in custody. After the tragedy, politicians from both sides of the aisle expressed condolences and offered prayers for the dead and first responders. The extreme politicization of the Rittenhouse case has only increased since he was found not guilty of first-degree intentional homicide and four other felony charges on Friday. The jury was bound to make its evaluation not on political considerations but on the narrower questions of Wisconsin\u2019s law and video evidence and testimony presented at trial. It appears to have accepted Rittenhouse\u2019s testimony that he fired after he felt that his own life was threatened during standoffs with two White men who died and one who was wounded and that he was acting in line with his right to self-defense. If the jury system is to survive, verdicts must be respected by those who disagree with them \u2013 something President Joe Biden affirmed on Friday saying, \u201cI stand by what the jury has concluded.\u201d That, however, has not stopped an explosion of political reactions since Rittenhouse walked free from court that look certain to become even more controversial as he is made into a hero by conservative media, with Fox News\u2019 Tucker Carlson securing exclusive access to him and members of his defense team during the trial for an upcoming documentary. Biden reacts to Rittenhouse verdict: 'The jury system works, and we have to abide by it' Democratic politicians, including Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and members of Congress, have registered various levels of disappointment with the verdict, though some refrained from criticizing the jury outright. Others have been much more outspoken. New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called for a federal review of the verdict, tweeting: \u201cJustice cannot tolerate armed persons crossing state lines looking for trouble while people engage in First Amendment-protected protest.\u201d Rittenhouse, however, did not cross state lines with the weapon, according to testimony in the trial. Gun control groups and civil rights activists have warned that the outcome of the case could trigger an outburst of vigilantism \u2013 of Americans deciding to take their vision of justice into their own hands and to enforce their will with firearms in a way that could let loose anarchy and threaten the First Amendment right to protest. And some prominent African American leaders have questioned whether a Black defendant in Rittenhouse\u2019s shoes would have received similar treatment or would have lived to even have their day in court after a history of police shootings of Black men. The new campaign from O\u2019Rourke, who came within three points of defeating GOP Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018 and mounted an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020, was always going to cause a new kerfuffle over gun control. In a Democratic debate in September 2019, the former congressman said, \u201cHell yes, we\u2019re going to take your AR-15, your AK-47,\u201d calling for a government buy-back scheme for such weapons following a mass shooting in West Texas that killed seven people and wounded 22 others. Beto O'Rourke: Texas campaign won't be about Biden \u201cYes, I still hold this view,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Sunday, trying to turn the conversation to his claim that permit-less carry laws signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott would make the lives of the state\u2019s police officers more dangerous. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position draws him into a direct confrontation with the GOP incumbent, who has presided over a loosening of restrictions on firearms in an already heavily pro-gun state. The Rittenhouse verdict, however, effectively fast-tracked scrutiny of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s position only a few days after he announced his run for the governor\u2019s mansion. \u201cThis entire tragedy makes the case that we should not allow our fellow Americans to own and use weapons that were originally designed for battlefield use,\u201d he said. \u201cThat AR-15, that AK-47 has one, single solitary purpose, and that is killing people as effectively, as efficiently, in as great a number, in as little time as possible. We saw that in Kenosha. We saw that in El Paso, Texas, where 23 people were murdered by someone with an AK-47 just in a matter of minutes. This is crazy.\u201d Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who is increasingly criticizing Trump\u2019s election lies and could run for president in 2024, made a contrary case, choosing not to comment on the matter of guns but on what he views as the politicization of the case from the left. \u201cJustice was done \u2026 and the jury system works,\u201d Christie said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cI think those people on the left are just attempting to continue to tear our country apart for political gain. Anybody who looked at the videos of this could tell that this was an act of self-defense. Anyone who knows the law would know that,\u201d Christie said. The former New Jersey governor said he hoped Rittenhouse would be able to go on and live his life and \u201cnot become a political symbol for anybody.\u201d Given Rittenhouse\u2019s cooperation with the behind-the-scenes Fox News documentary, even while the trial was going on, and the way he is being made a hero figure on the right, that possibility already seems to have disappeared only three days after his acquittal.",

            "article_content": "A simmering war within the Georgia Republican Party is about \u2013 what else? \u2013 Donald Trump. The former President \u2013 still angry over how Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp responded to the 2020 election results in his state \u2013 may get his wish for a credible primary challenger to the Republican leader. Republicans in the state have told CNN they expect former Sen. David Perdue to make a decision soon about running against Kemp in next year\u2019s primary, after Perdue allies floated the possibility last month. At the center of the potential fight is Trump\u2019s false contention that the election was stolen, with the narrow victory for Joe Biden in Georgia as a central part of the tale. Despite Kemp\u2019s call for an audit that turned up no substantial change in the overall vote count, Trump continues to blame the governor for not contesting the results enough and has vowed to back a primary challenger. So far, no one of note has emerged to take on Kemp and get the Trump endorsement. A Perdue bid for governor could change that. A match-up between Kemp and Perdue could not only upend Georgia\u2019s governor race but split the GOP at a time when the party\u2019s dominance in the state has been threatened by recent electoral wins by Democrats. Some Republicans fear that a contested primary over the issue of the 2020 election could only further damage the GOP, which, in addition to the losing the presidential election there, also lost both of its US Senate seats in Georgia this year in runoff elections \u2013 including Perdue\u2019s. \u201cI would hate to see two good men run against each other,\u201d said Eric Tanenblatt, a veteran GOP strategist and former chief of staff to former Republican Gov. Sonny Perdue. \u201cHaving watched the Republican Party become the dominant party in Georgia, it\u2019s puzzling to me we would see a sitting incumbent Republican governor be challenged by another Republican.\u201d Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, a staunch supporter of Trump in the US House, told CNN Tuesday that he does and will continue to support Kemp for governor. The Republican congressman added that he does not know what Perdue will do. \u201cMy hope is that he won\u2019t run,\u201d said Carter. \u201cMy hope is that we\u2019ll have just one candidate that we can unify behind.\u201d But other allies of the former President counter that Kemp will be unable to keep Trump voters in the fold. On Sunday, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House and a Trump ally, posted on his personal website that only Perdue, not Kemp, could unite the party and defeat Democrat Stacey Abrams, who has not yet declared but is thought to be considering her own bid for governor. The result of all this is what one Republican operative in Georgia called a \u201cmeltdown\u201d by Kemp\u2019s political operation in its attempt to discourage Perdue from running. Republican critics of Kemphave accused the governor\u2019s chief of staff of threatening potential Perdue allies with political retribution. Meanwhile, Kemp\u2019s PAC and campaign have been hiring members of Perdue\u2019s wider political circle. \u201cThey\u2019re playing hardball,\u201d said a second GOP operative in Georgia. Kemp allies, on the other hand, say the governor is simply taking the threat of a primary challenge from a former US senator seriously. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be an all-out fight,\u201d said one person allied with Kemp. When asked for comment, a spokesman for Kemp\u2019s campaign provided CNN with a statement. \u201cGovernor Kemp and Marty proudly campaigned hard for \u2013 and with \u2013 former Senator Perdue and Bonnie throughout the 2020 election cycle,\u201d said Tate Mitchell. \u201cBoth the Governor and the First Lady were honored when Senator Perdue told them personally that he would fully support their campaign for re-election earlier this year.\u201d Efforts to reach Perdue for comment were unsuccessful. On Monday, Kemp launched a TV ad that makes a positive case for his first term as governor. The ad highlights Georgia\u2019s economic health along with policies meant to appeal to Republican primary voters. The ad touts that Kemp \u201cbacked the blue, stopping the radical left from defunding local police,\u201d \u201cpassed a tough new election integrity bill,\u201d and \u201ckept our schools and businesses open, while keeping Georgians safe\u201d during the pandemic. But the sunny tone of the ad is at odds with what people close to Kemp say would be a brutal campaign against Perdue if he challenges the governor. Nothing, the Kemp ally said, would be off limits for going after Perdue and making his life \u201ca living hell.\u201d \u201cW\u200b\u200be\u2019d have the resources and we\u2019d have the motive,\u201d said this person. That may include targeting a series of stock trades Perdue made in January 2020 following a briefing about the then-nascent coronavirus pandemic. The New York Times reported last year that the Justice Department opened an investigation into Perdue\u2019s transactions but declined to press charges. A spokeswoman for Perdue at the time, Casey Black, told CNN, \u201cSeparate reviews by the Department of Justice, the Securities & Exchange Commission, and the bipartisan Senate Ethics Committee each quickly and independently cleared Senator Perdue of any wrongdoing.\u201d The saber-rattling from Kemp allies only underscores how the governor\u2019s team is on guard about a looming primary fight. Their fears are two-fold: One, that Perdue can successfully challenge Kemp with the backing of Trump; and two, that Kempsurvives a bitter primary fight that leaves him and the party damaged ahead of the 2022 general election, which Republicans believe would be another tough battle after Kemp\u2019s narrow 2018 victory over Democrat Stacey Abrams. Adding to the stakes is the GOP\u2019s fight to win back a Senate seat from Democrat Raphael Warnock, who defeated Perdue\u2019s fellow Republican Kelly Loeffler in the other runoff election earlier this year. The top Republican in the Senate primary, football great Herschel Walker, has a troubled personal history, including allegations uncovered by CNN Investigates and other news outlets that the former football star threatened women with violence beyond what he disclosed in his memoir. That has some GOP strategists worried about Walker\u2019s chances against Warnock. A well-positioned gubernatorial candidate at the top of the ticket could help boost Walker. But despite the warning signs to the Trump-led GOP the 2020 presidential election and the 2021 Senate runoffs, Trump remains a force among Georgia Republicans, particularly those who vote in primaries. \u201cDavid Perdue with Donald Trump\u2019s backing is dangerous,\u201d said the second GOP operative. Trump has focused his ire particularly on Georgia Republicans he deems disloyal in the wake of the 2020 election. Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, received the brunt of Trump\u2019s anger about his loss in the state by fewer than 12,000 votes. In a January 2 phone call with Raffensperger, Trump asked the secretary of state to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes for Trump to make up the difference \u2013 a request the Georgia Republican rejected. Raffensperger now faces a formidable primary challenge from Rep. Jody Hice, whom Trump has endorsed. \u201cUnlike the current Georgia Secretary of State, Jody leads out front with integrity,\u201d Trump said in a statement in March. \u201cJody will stop the Fraud and get honesty into our Elections!\u201d Trump made a similar appeal to Kemp, asking in a phone call in December 2020 for the Georgia governor to convene state legislators to select pro-Trump electors. Kemp, who had already approved the certification of Georgia\u2019s electoral votes for Joe Biden, told Trump he had no authority to do anything to change the election results. In response, Trump blasted Kemp as a \u201cRINO\u201d and later said he was \u201cashamed\u201d to have endorsed him in 2018. During an appearance in Georgia before the Senate runoff elections in January, Trump vowed to campaign against Kemp before the 2022 primary. But Trump\u2019s struggles to find someone with the ability to take on Kemp show how difficult it can be to take on an incumbent governor, particularly one as powerful as Georgia\u2019s. Burt Jones, a state senator and perhaps Trump\u2019s most ardent supported among elected officials in the Peach State, resisted overtures from the former president to take on Kemp. Instead, Jones is running in an open primary for lieutenant governor. Last December, Trump publicly floated that outgoing Rep. Doug Collins could run for governor. But Collins, who had unsuccessfully run for the Senate in last year\u2019s special election, announced in April he would not be running for any office in 2022. And while former state Rep. Vernon Jones (no relation to Burt Jones), who is close to several in Trump\u2019s orbit, got into the race for governor in April, Trump has not yet backed him. A former Democrat, Jones was a fixture at Trump campaign rallies and spoke at the Republican National Convention in 2020. He switched parties this year and has become a vocal avatar for the right wing of the Republican base. Despite striking out, Trump\u2019s animosity toward Kemp has not abated. While at a rally in Georgia in September, Trump even said he would prefer if Abrams, who may run again for governor next year, had the top job instead of Kemp. Party leaders were caught flat-footed by the remark but seemed unwilling to rebuke the former president or rally to Kemp\u2019s side. \u201cI think the most notable part is the quiet of everyone in the GOP in Georgia,\u201d said Erick Erickson, an Atlanta-based talk radio host, told CNN at the time. \u201cNo one agrees with him. No one is endorsing it. But no one is vocally pushing back, either.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "When former President Donald Trump fired off a letter in September demanding that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger decertify the election, investigators in Georgia were paying attention. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis made clear to her staff she wanted that letter \u2013 the original copy, complete with the envelope \u2013 as part of her probe into Trump\u2019s efforts to upend Georgia\u2019s 2020 election results, according to a person familiar with the matter. Trump, still stewing over his 2020 loss and eying a run in 2024, has continued to bellow complaints about the results of the last presidential election and insert himself into Peach State politics. And his antics have provided new fodder for Fulton County investigators as they examine whether his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results were criminal. At a recent campaign stop in the state, Trump also offered investigators more insight into his interactions with another potentially relevant witness: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Trump regaled his adoring fans at a September rally with a reenactment of his attempts last December to convince Kemp to hold a special election in the state, one of Trump\u2019s last-ditch efforts to try to reverse the Georgia results. After Kemp rebuffed multiple Trump aides who apparently tried to convince him to announce a special election, Trump said, he decided it was time to step in. \u201cSo I said, \u2018Let me handle it. This is easy.\u2019 I got this guy elected,\u201d Trump told the rally crowd, while insisting he wasn\u2019t looking for a quid pro quo. \u201cI said, \u2018Brian, listen, you have a big election integrity problem in Georgia. I hope you can help us out and call a special election and let\u2019s get to the bottom of it for the good of the country.\u2019\u201d Kemp, in the December call with Trump, refused. \u201cHe\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Trump told the crowd. Meanwhile, investigators were quietly taking notes, a person familiar with the matter said, of the repeated attempts Trump and his allies made to try to pressure Kemp to announce another election \u2013 all recounted in Trump\u2019s own words. As Willis has delved into her Trump investigation, which she opened in February, she has made clear that she is looking into his activities surrounding the Georgia election. But she also plans to examine actions taken by Trump allies, including his former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, South Carolina\u2019s Sen. Lindsey Graham and others, that may have aided his efforts. The sprawling probe, which may soon be on a collision course with the upcoming midterm elections, has at times proved daunting even to those inside the district attorney\u2019s office. But newly public records \u2013 including the Trump letter, a new book by Raffensperger and testimony released by a Senate panel investigating Trump\u2019s election meddling \u2013 has helped define the road map for Georgia investigators. \u201cAll relevant information, whether gathered by our office, another investigative body or made public by witnesses themselves, is part of the ongoing investigation,\u201d said Jeff DiSantis, a spokesman for the Fulton County district attorney\u2019s office. Raffensperger\u2019s new book, \u201cIntegrity Counts,\u201d includes an annotated blow-by-blow of his now-infamous January call with the then-President, in which Raffensperger \u2013 a fellow Republican \u2013 notes at various points that he felt Trump was threatening him. At one point in the call Trump insisted, inaccurately, that some ballots were corrupt and then baselessly suggested the secretary of state\u2019s office wasn\u2019t reporting the corrupted ballots. \u201cIt is more illegal for you than it is for them, because, you know what they did and you\u2019re not reporting it. That\u2019s a criminal, that\u2019s a criminal offense. And you can\u2019t let that happen. That\u2019s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer,\u201d Trump said in the call, the audio of which CNN obtained earlier this year. Raffensperger writes that in that moment, \u201cNow President Trump is using what he believes is the power of his position to threaten [General Counsel Ryan Germany] and me with prosecution if we don\u2019t do what he tells us to do. It was nothing but an attempt at manipulation.\u201d In an interview with CNN, Raffensperger said he worried about whether Trump could somehow weaponize the Department of Justice or the FBI against him and others in his office. 'It's absolutely getting worse': Secretaries of state targeted by Trump election lies live in fear for their safety and are desperate for protection \u201cI could hear that he thought that he could have some kind of pressure to bear from outside forces to make our life miserable,\u201d Raffensperger said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t care about one person. That person was in their way. Didn\u2019t mean to be in their way, I\u2019m just doing my job, just reporting the facts.\u201d Raffensperger\u2019s clear perception that he was being threatened was \u201cvery helpful\u201d for investigators, according to a person familiar with Willis\u2019 probe. \u201cThat\u2019s like having an ace in the hole,\u201d said Michael J. Moore, a former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a much better day for the prosecution if you can say: And he was threatened and he felt \u2013 clearly felt threatened in his job \u2013 whether that was with a criminal offense or something else. He felt like the President was trying to threaten him to change votes.\u201d Investigators still haven\u2019t spoken directly with Raffensperger, although he said he would be willing to appear before a grand jury if summoned. \u201cI don\u2019t know where that really goes,\u201d Raffensperger said. Still, \u201cI\u2019ll be there to give her my vision, my opinion or my comments on what I saw.\u201d As for Trump\u2019s September missive asking him to decertify the election, Raffensperger says it doesn\u2019t feel quite so threatening now that Trump is no longer in the Oval Office. \u201cI think more and more people \u2013 many of the people that I\u2019m talking to \u2013 wish we could just move on, realizing that it\u2019s not productive, it\u2019s not useful, and it hurts the brand,\u201d Raffensperger told CNN, expressing his belief Trump was damaging the GOP. As the 2022 midterm elections draw nearer, the landscape is likely to grow more complicated for witnesses and investigators alike. And Willis\u2019 slow-moving investigation could soon run up against the electoral calendar. \u201cI think that a prosecutor\u2019s job is not to be political, but I don\u2019t think you can divorce yourself from political reality,\u201d said Moore, the former US attorney. \u201cAnd we all know what the calendar is.\u201d Moore said that ideally Willis would have an announcement to make by early spring about whether she has sought an indictment for Trump. \u201cI think that gives her a pretty good window before the election,\u201d Moore said. \u201cBut it is fodder for the candidates and the ad buyers to use for many months leading up to November of 2022. And that\u2019s just the reality of where we\u2019re at with time.\u201d For Trump\u2019s part, he has already begun hinting that he is being unfairly targeted in Fulton County. Trump's spiteful support for Abrams over Kemp sparks midterms fear from Georgia Republicans \u201cEven the Fulton County DA, district attorney, is after me,\u201d Trump told rallygoers in Perry in September. For many Republicans in Georgia, Willis\u2019 ongoing investigation, Trump\u2019s preoccupation with 2020 and his vendetta against Republicans who failed to assist his efforts to cling to office have amalgamated into one giant political headache. Raffensperger faces a tough reelection fight. He\u2019ll be up against Rep. Jody Hice \u2013 who contends Trump was the true victor in Georgia and who has the backing of the former President \u2013 in the GOP primary. But Raffensperger has made clear he has no intention of whitewashing the events surrounding the 2020 election. \u201cI wanted to tell the facts about what happened in the 2020 election. There\u2019d been so much misinformation, disinformation, so this is to set the record straight,\u201d Raffensperger said of his new book. As for his reelection bid: \u201cI\u2019m comfortable where I\u2019m sitting now,\u201d Raffensperger said. Other Republicans aren\u2019t so sanguine. Some have privately fretted that the Willis investigation could act as a drag on Republicans who thwarted Trump\u2019s election meddling as the midterms approach. Kemp, who declined to comment for this story, has remained essentially silent about Trump\u2019s election meddling attempts and signed a restrictive new voting law as he tries to repair his image with the GOP base. Trump, in the meantime, has been searching for a GOP primary challenger to take him on. Demonstrating the extent to which he dislikes Kemp, the former President has even suggested Democrat Stacey Abrams may be a preferable governor. And he has vowed to defeat the Republicans who refused to go along with his plans to upend the 2020 election. \u201cThey attacked and cheated on our elections,\u201d Trump told Georgia rallygoers in September, as he tore into Kemp and Raffensperger. \u201cNow the people of Georgia must replace the RINOs and weak Republicans who made it all possible.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Voters will decide Tuesday on key issues that could have national implications related to policing, election reform and some proposals authored in response to Covid-19 restrictions. During this off-election year, a combined 24 statewide ballot measures are up for consideration in six states \u2013 Colorado, Maine, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Washington, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures \u2013 in addition to a string of proposals in municipal elections nationwide. Voters\u2019 answers on these issues could signal how they\u2019ll fare in future, bigger elections. Below are some of the more prominent questions organized by topic. Texas \u2013 Proposition 3 (statewide) Written in response to Covid-19 restrictions, Texans will consider a constitutional amendment that would prohibit the state or a political subdivision, such as an elected official, from \u201cprohibiting or limiting religious services of religious organizations.\u201d At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, a majority of states including Texas issued stay-at-home orders to minimize non-essential gatherings and slow the spread of the virus. While a small handful of states limited in-person church services, Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deemed religious worship an essential service and exempt from his stay-at-home executive order. Texas state lawmakers approved adding Proposition 3 to ballots with a bipartisan vote earlier this year, and Abbott has voiced support for the amendment. Its Republican authors say that the amendment strengthens constitutional protections for Texas churches and that \u201cin both times of calm and in times of crisis, we shouldn\u2019t limit the Church.\u201d Opponents of Proposition 3, including Americans United for Separation of Church and State and some faith groups, argue that it endangers public health. Texas \u2013 Proposition 6 (statewide) Like Proposition 3, Proposition 6 was also influenced by the Covid-19 restrictions enforced during the height of the pandemic. Last year, Texas restricted in-person visits from family and friends not designated essential caregivers to nursing homes to prevent any Covid-19 outbreaks among their vulnerable communities. Proposition 6 would codify the right for long-term care residents to designate an essential caregiver for in-person visitation. The Texas legislature passed a law earlier this year that accompanies the amendment. Supporters say the amendment and the enabling bill strike a balance between ensuring residents have access to loved ones and giving a facility flexibility to respond to an outbreak, while critics argue that more than one caregiver at a time should be allowed, according to a Texas House Research Organization analysis. Minneapolis \u2013 Question 2 Calls to defund and dismantle the Minneapolis Police Department grew in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder last year by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Question 2 would replace Minneapolis Police Department with a new \u201cDepartment of Public Safety\u201d overseen by the mayor and city council. The new public safety department could have police officers but the city will no longer be required to employ a minimum number of officers. If the measure is passed, the city would need to appoint a new public safety commissioner. Five mayoral races to watch on Tuesday The campaign urging people to vote \u201cno\u201d says that Minneapolis needs comprehensive reforms, not a \u201cdangerous experiment\u201d to eliminate the Minneapolis Police Department \u201cwith no plan for the future of public safety in our city.\u201d Those advocating \u201cyes\u201d on Question 2 say the measure does not abolish the police, but would lead to more accountable, transparent and better trained officers, CNN reported. Cleveland \u2013 Issue 24 Ballot initiative Issue 24 would establish a new civilian commission, called the Community Police Commission, whose members will have final authority over the police department\u2019s policy and procedures, hiring and training, and disciplinary action. The mayor would appoint 13 commission members, with the city council\u2019s vote of approval, for a four-year term. Under the initiative, the Office of Professional Standards, an independent agency that investigates non-criminal complaints against Cleveland police, would report to the Civilian Police Review Board instead of the police chief. The agency would also be allowed to expand its investigations beyond what is in the complaint. The backers of Issue 24, Citizens for a Safer Cleveland, argue that the measure will ensure \u201creal accountability\u201d for police and that any investigations of police misconduct are \u201ctruly independent.\u201d Opponents of the ballot initiative warn that it gives too much power to unelected group of civilians with no police training or expertise, and few checks and balances. Albany, New York \u2013 Proposal 7 Proposal 7, also known as Local Law J, asks city residents whether to expand a civilian police review board\u2019s authority to conduct investigations and \u201cto exercise oversight, review, and resolution of community complaints alleging abuse of police authority.\u201d Under the measure, the Community Police Review Board could conduct independent investigations even if there\u2019s no complaint filed with the board and would have subpoena power. The proposal would also allocate funding that is no less than 1% of the Albany Police Department\u2019s total proposed budget for the board\u2019s operations. Albany\u2019s city council unanimously approved the measure, believing that reforms are long overdue, while police unions have pushed back on the proposal, calling it a \u201cpower grab\u201d and saying it will drive a wedge between the community and police, the Albany Times Union reported. Austin, Texas \u2013 Proposition A Voters in Austin, Texas are being asked whether to bulk up the city\u2019s police department with Proposition A, as its supporters argue that the city is in the midst of a \u201ccrime wave\u201d and a shortage of police officers. Proposition A would require that the Austin police department employs at least two police officers for every 1,000 residents. The measure would require a minimum of 35% \u201ccommunity engagement time\u201d for all front-line officers and double their yearly mandatory training. It would also create an incentives program for officers who are in good standing, mentor cadets or are proficient in the foreign languages most spoken in Austin. Save Austin Now, the group behind Proposition A, says the measure is needed to make the city safer. \u201cNo Way on A\u201d calls the proposal a \u201cwolf in sheep\u2019s clothing\u201d and argues that if the measure passes, the city will be forced to make cuts to other essential services and potentially lay off other city workers, like firefighters or 911 operators. The group also points to the Austin city council\u2019s approval of a record $442 million budget for the Austin Police Department. Proposition A has an estimated cost between $271.5 million and $598.8 million over five years, and would require hiring between 403 to 885 officers over that time, according to the city\u2019s chief financial officer. Detroit \u2013 Proposal R A \u201cyes\u201d vote on Proposal R would be in favor of the Detroit City Council establishing a task force that would recommend housing and economic programs that \u201caddress historical discrimination against the Black community in Detroit.\u201d The city council has been behind Proposal R, with President Pro Tempore Mary Sheffield saying in a statement that it will \u201chelp move the conversation from talk to action and towards making amends for the most egregious discriminatory and racist practices of the past. \u201cUltimately, this is about repairing the damage done to the African American community and leveling the playing field so the aggrieved have an equal and real opportunity for success and a better quality of life,\u201d she said. New Jersey \u2013 Question No. 1 (statewide) Question No. 1 asks New Jersey voters whether to allow betting on college sports. Currently, sports betting on college events in the state and on college events in which New Jersey teams participate is prohibited. The resolution to add the question to the November ballot was approved by New Jersey\u2019s legislature, with a vote of 36-1 in the Senate and 70-4 in the Assembly. Democratic Sen. Paul Sarlo, one of the resolution\u2019s main sponsors, said New Jersey has become \u201cthe country\u2019s biggest sports betting market\u201d and \u201cwe need to support and sustain this growing market that is fast becoming a significant part of our regional and state economies.\u201d The NCAA announced last year that the Prudential Center in Newark, home of the Seton Hall University\u2019s basketball team, will be the site for the 2025 East Regional. \u201cMarch Madness is a high-profile event on the sports betting calendar and we should be a key player,\u201d Sarlo said. Approving college sports betting in the state would annually increase state revenues but by an \u201cindeterminate amount,\u201d according to the Office of Legislative Services\u2019 estimation. Richmond, Virginia \u2013 Local Referendum Residents of Virginia\u2019s capital city will decide whether to approve the construction of a new casino and 250-room luxury hotel in south Richmond along the I-95 highway. The ONE Casino + Resort, which would be owned by media company Urban One, would be the first Black-owned casino in the United States. Urban One says the project will generate an estimated $47 million in total annual revenue for Richmond and create 1,500 direct jobs. Virginia Democrats including Gov. Ralph Northam, gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe, and Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney have also urged residents to vote \u201cyes\u201d on the casino referendum, saying it will bring economic opportunity and jobs to the area. US Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat and former governor of the state, voted early and against the casino proposal because he \u201cbelieves there are better ways to enhance economic development in Richmond,\u201d WRIC reported. Others opposed to the project argue that a casino is exploitative and would be detrimental to Richmond\u2019s Black community. New York \u2013 Ballot Proposal 1 (statewide) New Yorkers are being reminded to flip over their ballots to answer five statewide ballot proposals. Of all the proposals up for consideration, Ballot Proposal 1 is the lengthiest and contains several components that would amend redistricting \u2013 the process for how district lines for congressional and state legislative offices are drawn. The amendment would require that state assembly and senate district lines be based on total population, and count all residents including non-citizens. It would ensure in the state constitution that incarcerated people would be counted at their last address of residence rather than where they\u2019re being detained. Under the proposal, the independent redistricting commission could select its two co-executive directors by a simple majority, without consideration of the appointee\u2019s party affiliation. The two co-executive directors of the redistricting commission will not have to be members of different political parties, and the state legislature won\u2019t be allowed to appoint them and their deputies if the commission fails to pick its co-executive directors. The proposal would also cap the number of state senators at its current total of 63. It also moves up the timeline for the commission to share its redistricting plans with state lawmakers. New York \u2013 Ballot Proposal 3 (statewide) New York currently requires that its residents register to vote at least 10 days before an election. Ballot Proposal 3 would remove that requirement, clearing the way for state lawmakers to enact new laws that would allow a resident to register to vote in less than 10 days \u2013 such as same-day voter registration. New York \u2013 Ballot Proposal 4 (statewide) As it stands now, New York voters may vote by absentee ballot if they are unable to appear at their polling place due to illness or physical disability or expect to be absent from their county of residence, or New York City if they\u2019re residents, on Election Day. Ballot Proposal 4 asks whether to eliminate the requirement that a voter provide a reason if they wish to vote by absentee ballot. Democrats and good government groups have backed the amendments 1, 3 and 4, saying the ballot proposals would expand access to voting and ensure fairer redistricting. The New York state Republican Party has opposed all the initiatives, launching a \u201cjust say no\u201d statewide tour urging voters to reject the ballot proposals. The state GOP argues that Ballot Proposal 1 weakens independent redistricting; Ballot Proposal 3 would \u201cinvite election fraud and abuse\u201d; and Ballot Proposal 4 would allow ballot harvesting.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is throwing his support behind a trio of candidates whose troubled pasts have come under scrutiny, as he continues to influence the standards of the GOP from his post-presidency perch. In Georgia, Trump has wholeheartedly endorsed former football star Herschel Walker for Senate, even though he\u2019s faced allegations of threatening multiple women over the span of a decade. In Ohio, Trump is backing former senior White House adviser Max Miller for Congress \u2013 even as he faces allegations of abuse from his ex-girlfriend, former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham. And in Pennsylvania, Trump threw his support behind retired Army captain Sean Parnell, who is embroiled in a custody battle with an estranged wife who previously obtained two temporary protection from abuse orders against him. None of these issues, which have been documented in interviews, court filings and police records, have dissuaded Trump. \u201cPresident Trump is proud to endorse patriots who love our country and will put America First, and he will not be dissuaded from supporting great candidates due to false smear campaigns by the Fake News media,\u201d Trump spokesperson Liz Harrington said. In Georgia, Trump has already appeared on the campaign trail alongside Walker, a former University of Georgia football player who has faced allegations of threatening multiple women. \u201cYou know, Herschel is not only a Georgia hero, he is an American legend,\u201d Trump said at a September rally with Walker. \u201cHerschel has been one of the greatest athletes in America and I know he will go down also as one of the greatest senators in America.\u201d Herschel Walker is often seen and seldom heard as Senate campaign gets rolling In a 2008 interview with CNN, Walker spoke openly about struggling with mental illness and the violent and disturbing thoughts he had. Walker said had been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, which was previously known as multiple personality disorder. \u201cYou can get angry, but the anger that you can go out and really, really hurt someone, and that\u2019s when you know you got a problem,\u201d Walker told CNN at the time. His ex-wife, Cindy Grossman, detailed her violent encounters with Walker in a 2008 interview as well. She said he had threatened her with guns as well as knives. In one instance, he held a straight razor to her throat and threatened to kill her. Grossman described the first time he held a gun to her head. \u201cHe held the gun to my temple and said he was going to blow my brains out,\u201d she said in 2008. At the time, Walker did not deny the incidents, but he said he could not remember them and noted that blackouts are among the symptoms of his illness. Another woman \u2013 a friend of Grossman\u2019s \u2013 also told police in the early 2000s that Walker had made \u201cthreats to her\u201d and had \u201cher house watched,\u201d according to a police report obtained by CNN. Walker\u2019s campaign noted he has gotten help since his allegedly violent incidents in the early 2000s. And in the 2008 interview, Walker described seeking out treatment, including seeing a therapist. \u201cSince getting help, Herschel has dedicated his life to helping others and has visited hundreds of military bases, hospitals, and non-profits sharing his own story with troops and other Americans,\u201d said Mallory Blount, a spokeswoman for Walker\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt is sad that many in politics and the media who praised Herschel for his transparency over a decade ago are now making false statements, stereotyping, attacking, and attempting to sensationalize his past just because he is a Republican Senate candidate.\u201d As Herschel Walker eyes Georgia US Senate seat, a newly revealed stalking claim brings his troubled history under scrutiny Another allegation against Walker arose years later. Myka Dean, who told police she had a romantic relationship with Walker, said he had threatened to kill her, according to a 2012 police report. According to the report, Dean said Walker told her he was \u201cgoing to \u2018blow his head off\u2019 after he killed her.\u201d Walker\u2019s campaign vehemently denied the claims involving Dean. \u201cThese baseless allegations are surfacing a decade later purely for political mudslinging, which is irresponsible and wrong,\u201d said Blount, the campaign spokeswoman. Dean died in 2019. In a statement from her mother, provided by the Walker campaign, Dean\u2019s mother said, \u201cThis is the first any of us knew about this. We are very proud of the man Herschel Walker has become.\u201d If the allegations against Walker are disconcerting to other GOP leaders, few are speaking out. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell recently downplayed the allegations of abuse against Walker in an interview with Politico. \u201cThere are some things written that indicate he\u2019s had some challenges in his life. On the other hand, the good news is, he\u2019s made several impressive performances on national television,\u201d McConnell told Politico. \u201cI think there\u2019s every indication he\u2019s going to be a good candidate.\u201d Trump has a track record of embracing prominent figures who have faced allegations of misconduct against women. In 2017, Trump endorsed Roy Moore for Senate during a special election in Alabama, even though multiple women had accused Moore of molesting or sexually assaulting them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. Moore denied the allegations and went on to lose the election. And Trump has faced allegations of his own. During his 2016 presidential campaign, more than a dozen women came forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against him. He denied them all and used their claims to try to cast himself as the victim. \u201cI am [a] victim of one of the great political smear campaigns in the history of our country,\u201d Trump claimed at a 2016 rally in North Carolina. \u201cDonald Trump has gravitated toward some people with real skeletons and scandals in their pasts,\u201d said CNN political commentator S.E. Cupp, noting Trump\u2019s prior endorsement of Moore. \u201cThere definitely seems to be a different tolerance level, and that\u2019s both inside the party and among voters, among Republican voters. I think once they swallowed Trump, that sort of conditioned the environment to kind of accept anything.\u201d Ruth Glenn, CEO and president of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, said America is still failing at treating women equitably and holding people in positions of power accountable for their actions toward women. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have a level of awareness about violence against women, what it looks like, what the dynamics are, how it can be insidious within our culture and be acceptable,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cWhat we hear as the underlying message is we \u2013 survivors and particularly women \u2013 don\u2019t matter.\u201d Grisham, who served as Trump\u2019s White House press secretary from 2019 to 2020, described it as a \u201cgut punch\u201d and said it \u201ckicked me in the teeth\u201d when she saw the former President endorse Miller, her ex-boyfriend, for Congress. \u201cYou have the opportunity to elect an incredible patriot to congress, who I know very well,\u201d Trump told the crowd at an Ohio rally in June. \u201cMax Miller, you know Max? Great guy. He loves our country. He loves the people of Ohio.\u201d Ohio Republican who voted to impeach Trump says he will not run for reelection in 2022 When Trump first endorsed Miller back in February, Grisham said she had already disclosed to the former President and his wife, Melania Trump, that her relationship with Miller had become abusive \u2013 a claim Miller has denied. \u201cI had an ex that I dated and there was abuse in every way there,\u201d Grisham told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something I actually told the President and the first lady about, and they did nothing. If it didn\u2019t affect them, and as long as I was keeping quiet and being good, then I guess that kind of behavior was OK.\u201d Grisham has not referred to Miller by name when discussing the abuse, instead describing him as an ex-boyfriend whose congressional bid has been endorsed by Trump. \u201cThe endorsement, really, it kicked me in the teeth,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThat was a really, really tough one, based on what happened.\u201d In the wake of those claims, Miller has denied the abuse and filed a defamation suit against Grisham. \u201cMs. Grisham\u2019s allegations that Mr. Miller was violent and physically abusive towards her are absolutely untrue,\u201d said Larry Zukerman, an attorney for Miller. Zukerman described Grisham as \u201cunemployed and unbelievable\u201d and accused her of using deceitful claims to promote her newly released book. Asked about the defamation lawsuit, Grisham told CNN, \u201cI want to respect the legal process so don\u2019t want to comment other than to say the lawsuit is an attempt at intimidation, which is right out of the Trump playbook.\u201d In Pennsylvania, Trump has elevated another candidate with a tumultuous backstory. \u201cCome on up here,\u201d Trump said at a September rally in Pennsylvania, welcoming Parnell on stage. \u201cSean Parnell, who has my complete and total endorsement.\u201d The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 Parnell, who is running in a GOP primary for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, has been embroiled in a messy divorce that has evolved into a deeply personal line of attack against his campaign. Jeff Bartos, one of Parnell\u2019s Republican opponents, and an aligned super PAC have tried to use two temporary protection from abuse orders filed against Parnell by his estranged wife as political weapons. \u201cWe know that Parnell\u2019s wife placed multiple 911 calls leading to protection from abuse order is being filed against Parnell, but now Parnell is trying to silence his wife with a gag order to stop her from talking about what happened,\u201d proclaimed one television ad from a pro-Bartos super PAC. When the protection from abuse orders first came to light, Parnell slammed the Bartos campaign in a statement provided to the Philadelphia Inquirer. \u201cJeff Bartos is a desperate liar, plain and simple,\u201d Parnell said in a statement to the newspaper. \u201cBartos\u2019 allegations are horrific lies and all the evidence proves it. Not only does he know full well that these allegations are provably false, but his willingness to spread these lies without any consideration for the damage he\u2019s doing to my three young kids is utterly disgusting. It takes a truly dishonorable \u2018man\u2019 to stoop this low just to score a few cheap political points.\u201d Parnell\u2019s campaign declined to comment for this story. But in a campaign release Monday, Parnell\u2019s team claimed the \u201csmear campaign\u201d against him was failing. Parnell\u2019s wife, Laurie Snell, filed the orders in 2017 and 2018, according to sheriff\u2019s department records. One was withdrawn under a mutual agreement from both parties and a judge declined to extend the 2018 order, according to people familiar with the situation. The orders \u2013 which lasted only a few days \u2013 and the allegations that prompted them have been expunged from court records. In order to obtain a temporary protection from abuse order, a person has to claim they have been abused or threatened with abuse, according to Butler County documents and attorneys who spoke to CNN. \u201cThere has to be a current fear and there has to have been some threat of harm or previous harm,\u201d said Susan Pearlstein, a senior attorney with Philadelphia Legal Assistance. \u201cIt\u2019s not based on how someone else would feel \u2013 it\u2019s this person in this circumstance, do they have a reasonable fear of imminent harm.\u201d A lawyer for Snell declined to comment on the circumstances that led to the protection from abuse orders but noted that Parnell had been \u201cexcluded from the home where she and their children have resided since 2018.\u201d The documents from the sheriff\u2019s department show that Parnell was required to relinquish his firearms under both protection from abuse orders and, in one case, he was required to leave the family home. In Butler County, temporary orders are granted with only one party \u2013 the person alleging abuse \u2013 present. A hearing later takes place with both parties, according to the sheriff\u2019s office. Sarah Katz, an associate clinical professor of law at Temple University, said there is a robust debate in the legal community about whether such protection orders are over or under-utilized. \u201cAre there examples we can point to of people misusing the process? Sure. There are always going to be people misusing the process,\u201d Katz said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe there\u2019s some rampage of people that are doing that.\u201d As Bartos and his allies seized on the issues surrounding Parnell\u2019s personal life and local media outlets began reporting on the issues, Parnell asked a judge in mid-September to seal his ongoing custody case and prevent his estranged wife from discussing it. In a court filing, Parnell noted he was running for Senate and pointed to stories that were published about the protection from abuse orders. He told the court he feared the details surrounding the case \u201cwill cause embarrassment, unnecessary scrutiny and negative issues for the parties\u2019 minor children.\u201d A judge declined to seal the case, except for in certain circumstances involving information about Parnell\u2019s children. Jennifer Gilliland Vanasdale, a lawyer for Snell, cheered the judge\u2019s ruling. \u201cThe powerful and influential are not entitled to special treatment and they should not be permitted to silence others,\u201d Vanasdale said.",

            "article_content": "Rudy Giuliani\u2019s former associate Lev Parnas was convicted on six counts related to \u201cinfluence buying\u201d campaign finance schemes. A jury of eight men and four women found Parnas guilty of scheming with co-conspirators to use a Russian backer\u2019s money to fund political contributions they hoped to trade for political favor for their budding joint cannabis venture. The Ukrainian businessman was also convicted for using money from Igor Fruman - who previously pleaded guilty \u2013 and a fake company to funnel hundreds of thousands in political contributions to GOP and pro-Donald Trump committees and then lying about it to the Federal Election Commission. A $325,000 donation to the America First Action Super PAC at issue in the case was first flagged in a 2018 FEC complaint. Parnas faces up to five years in prison for each of five counts and a sixth count for falsifying records to the FEC carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence. Co-defendant Andrey Kukushkin was also found guilty on two counts connected to his role in facilitating the campaign donations paid for with his Russian boss\u2019s money. Kukushkin\u2019s charges each carry a five-year maximum prison sentence. Parnas spoke outside court on Friday afternoon, saying, \u201cObviously I\u2019m upset, but at this time I just want to get home to my wife and kids and deal with it. I want to thank (my) lawyers, Joe and Stephanie. They put out an incredible fight, I mean, incredible. We got to reassess what happened in there and figure out what the next steps are.\u201d Judge J. Paul Oetken denied a prosecution motion to remand both defendants into custody, saying he does not believe either is a flight risk. Sentencing for Parnas will likely be deferred given his pending second trial on one count related to the Fraud Guarantee allegations, the judge said. Kukushkin is scheduled to be sentenced in mid-February. Parnas stared straight ahead at the jury as the jury foreman read the verdict. Kukushkin shook his head as they read guilty on each count against him. The verdict comes two years after Parnas and Fruman were arrested at a Washington-area airport as they were boarding a flight to Vienna. The arrest came amid the House Democrats\u2019 investigation \u2013 and eventual impeachment trial \u2013 of then-President Trump and launched two unknown Florida businessmen with shaky track records onto the global stage. Parnas ultimately did not testify but he appeared to seriously consider the move in his own defense. Prosecutors were hoping to question Parnas on his quid pro quo propositions to Ukrainian politicians for Trump Giuliani\u2019s behest \u2013 a situation he openly discussed with Anderson Cooper on CNN. Oetken also said Parnas\u2019 alleged \u201cFraud Guarantee\u201d scheme to defraud investors in his fake company would have been fair game to an extent. Parnas still faces a trial related to those allegations and a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit. Kukushkin attorney Gerald Lefcourt told jurors in his closing argument that his client was nothing more than an aspiring cannabis entrepreneur working for a wealthy Russian businessman and they were duped by Parnas and Fruman who scammed them out of $1 million. \u201cParnas and Fruman represented themselves as associated with the President, the president\u2019s lawyer and all these important people,\u201d Lefcourt said. \u201cIt looked good on the surface, even though it was all baloney.\u201d Kukushkin declined to testify. His counsel did not call any witnesses in his defense and often declined to cross examine several prosecution witnesses. Oetken denied a previous request for a separate trial from Parnas ahead of the trial. During the trial, jurors didn\u2019t hear about Parnas\u2019 life crisscrossing Europe with Giuliani to compile what he claimed to be damaging information on then-presidential-candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter \u2013 but Trump and his personal attorney were not absent from the case. Prosecutors showed jurors several photos of Parnas and Fruman grinning next to Trump, Giuliani and other high-profile Republican figures like Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. On Tuesday, America First Action Financial Director Joseph Ahearn testified with immunity as the only witness called in the defense case by Parnas\u2019 counsel. Ahearn placed Parnas in the room at several exclusive events and intimate donor dinners with Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and California GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy at Mar a Lago and the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC. Ahearn testified that he first met Parnas in person at a \u201cpre sale\u201d joint financing committee event for potential deep-pocketed GOP donors in February 2018. Ahearn said former New York Assemblyman Stephen Katz put Parnas on his fundraising radar, advertising Parnas as wealthy and politically connected. He invited him to that first exclusive event understanding Parnas to have a history of big donations to Trump in 2016, Ahearn testified. During the trial, jurors also saw text messages from Ahearn pushing for Parnas to make good on large donation commitments to America First Action and the Protect the House committee to secure VIP access to GOP candidates and events. Parnas\u2019 defense argued that he didn\u2019t want to wait to start the GEP bank account for the \u201cstart-up\u201d company to send the $325,000 to the Super PAC because Ahearn pushed him for the money so Parnas wouldn\u2019t lose out on \u201cswanky VIP events,\u201d defense attorney Joseph Bondy reasoned during his closing argument. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to those events without paying the piper,\u201d Bondy said. Ahearn said he confronted Parnas in July 2018 about media articles questioning the legitimacy of Global Energy Producers and its donation to America First Action but acknowledged he continued to work with Parnas for months despite the FEC complaint flagging the $325,000 donation. Parnas\u2019 former assistant Deanna Janse Van Rensburg also testified under immunity that she helped Parnas and Fruman transact more than $500,000 in campaign contributions and tickets for political events for GOP politicians and committees often coordinating with Ahearn and other campaign staffers.

            "article_content": "Federal prosecutors in New York are expected to rest their campaign finance case against Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas this week. Over three days of testimony last week, prosecutors conveyed to jurors a pay-to-play scheme by Parnas and his co-conspirators to exchange campaign donations for political capital they\u2019d hoped to cash in for cannabis industry licenses. A \u201cRussian tycoon\u201d wired $1 million to Parnas to \u201cinfiltrate American elections,\u201d prosecutor Aline Flodr said during opening statements. And despite having little money of his own, Parnas attempted to garner influence and status in circles of prominent GOP figures taking \u201ccredit for large political donations when in reality it was never his money to give.\u201d Parnas faces charges related to two alleged campaign finance schemes. In one, prosecutors say Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman \u2013 who has pleaded guilty \u2013 conspired in 2018 to skirt campaign contribution limits and falsely report contributions to the Federal Election Commission by concealing the donations through a company prosecutors say was a front for political dealings. Andrey Kukushkin, who is also on trial, allegedly conspired and aided Parnas in coordinating straw donations on behalf of his Russian financial backer to gain favor with politicians in states with a legal marijuana industry, prosecutors say. \u201cThese men shoveled thousands and thousands of dollars of foreign money to US politicians, laughing about how they were breaking the law along the way,\u201d Flodr said. Texas Rep. Pete Sessions\u2019 former chief of staff is expected to testify Monday to donations Parnas and Fruman made to Sessions\u2019 campaign. A top fundraising official for the pro-Trump America First Action Super PAC Joseph Ahearn is also expected to testify to interactions with the men and a $325,000 donation at issue for Parnas since a 2018 Federal Elections Commission complaint. Last week jurors saw text messages from Ahearn pushing for Parnas to make good on large donation commitments to America First Action to secure VIP access to GOP candidates and events. The trial continues nearly two years to the day when Parnas and Fruman were arrested at a Washington-area airport as they were boarding a flight to Vienna. The arrest came amid the House Democrats\u2019 investigation \u2013 and eventual impeachment trial \u2013 of then-President Donald Trump and launched two unknown Florida businessmen with shaky track records onto the global stage. Attorneys per an agreement won\u2019t discuss Parnas\u2019 life crisscrossing Europe with Rudy Giuliani to compile what he claimed to be damaging information on then-presidential-candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, but there\u2019s been no shortage of references to  Trump and his personal attorney. Prosecutors have shown jurors several photos of Parnas and Fruman grinning next to Trump, Giuliani and other high-profile GOP figures like Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, and Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. Nevada politician Adam Laxalt, who ran a failed gubernatorial bid in 2018 and is now running for US Senate, first met Parnas via an introduction from Giuliani on a smoke-filled balcony during an event at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, DC, he testified Friday. Parnas was quick to offer help fundraising in the last weeks of the campaign, a commitment he fell short on, according to Laxalt. Laxalt admitted to \u201cbombarding\u201d Parnas for money despite thinking Parnas was a \u201cclownish guy with a gold chain.\u201d Laxalt said he felt Parnas was an \u201codd character\u201d who was only around for the photos, but continued to push the Ukrainian businessman for money because his close-personal friend DeSantis vouched for Parnas and Fruman as well-known donors in Florida. The two never discussed political assistance with a cannabis venture, according to Laxalt. As a candidate running against the expansion of recreational marijuana in Nevada, Laxalt said he was the wrong guy to ask. Laxalt recounted setting up a dinner with Parnas at an \u201cold mob joint\u201d in Las Vegas that fall. Nevada politician Wes Duncan, who lost his attorney general race that year and also testified in the trial, attended the dinner. Both Laxalt and Duncan accepted donations from Fruman via Parnas that tied to charges in the case. The politicians ultimately returned the money when it was flagged suspicious. Parnas\u2019 attorney has chalked up the FEC violations as honest mistakes by Parnas who he says isn\u2019t well-educated nor an expert on complex campaign finance regulations. Laxalt testified that he recognized Fruman\u2019s face in a photo of the two with Parnas at a campaign event, but couldn\u2019t remember his name and didn\u2019t remember speaking to him at any point. He also said he recognized Kukushkin in a photo as someone who hung around Parnas but didn\u2019t know him either. Oetken did not permit a line of questioning about Laxalt\u2019s current pursuit of a US Senate seat. No questions were asked about Laxalt\u2019s role as a campaign chair for Trump in Nevada nor his efforts to discredit election results in Trump\u2019s loss in Nevada. Prosecutors argue that Parnas with Fruman created a fake company Global Energy Producers to funnel political donations through, including the $325,000 to America First Action. Defense attorney Joseph Bondy aimed to discredit Parnas\u2019 former employee Deanna Janse Van Rensburg, pointing out inconsistencies in her testimony with previous statements she\u2019d made to the FBI. Van Rensburg testified during cross examination that she recalled telling the FBI in 2019 that she saw the men do what looked like legitimate energy business. Van Rensburg will continue on the stand Monday. Bondy would not confirm to the court whether Parnas will testify on his own behalf. Attorneys for Kukushkin said they do not plan to call any witnesses in their defense case. They\u2019ve declined to cross examine several witnesses so far, and attorney Gerald Lefcourt told jurors in his opening statement that Kukushkin is a just a low-level bussinessman wrongfully caught up in this case \u2013 pointing to Fruman and the Russian \u201ctycoon\u201d for executing the campaign donations scheme.",

            "article_content": "The campaign finance trial against Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Ukrainian-born associate, Lev Parnas, is set to start Tuesday in Manhattan federal court. Parnas faces charges related to two alleged campaign finance schemes. In one alleged scheme, prosecutors say Parnas and another Giuliani associate, Igor Fruman \u2013 who has pleaded guilty \u2013 conspired in 2018 to skirt campaign contribution limits and falsely report contributions to the Federal Election Commission by concealing the donations through a company prosecutors say was a front for political dealings. Jurors will also hear evidence on charges connected to an alleged effort by Parnas, Fruman, and business associate Andrey Kukushkin to funnel $1 million from a Russian national into state and federal elections to benefit their future cannabis business venture. Lev Parnas trial judge says he will question prospective jurors who have strong feelings about Trump or Giuliani The trial begins nearly two years to the day when Parnas and Fruman were arrested at a Washington-area airport as they were boarding a flight to Vienna. The arrest came amid the House Democrats\u2019 investigation \u2013 and eventual impeachment trial \u2013 of then-President Donald Trump and launched two unknown Florida businessmen with shaky track records onto the global stage. The criminal trial is not expected to take the jury into Parnas\u2019 life crisscrossing Europe with Giuliani to compile what he claimed to be damaging information on then-presidential-candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter, but the former President and his attorney won\u2019t be absent from the case, either. Prosecutors said at a recent court hearing that they intend to show the jury photos that Parnas texted to Kukushkin of Parnas with Giuliani and Trump that he used to tout his connections and influence. It won\u2019t just be prosecutors who will accuse Parnas of fraud. Attorneys for Kukushkin said they will argue that Parnas duped Kukushkin and his Russian backer who, he says, were unaware of the scheme, setting the stage for some potentially tense moments. District Judge Paul Oetken denied a previous request for a separate trial and said he\u2019d rule on contentious trial moments as they come. Parnas and Kukushkin have denied any wrongdoing. Attorneys spent time with Oetken in recent days discussing what the parties can and cannot address during the trial, debating how best to tamp down potentially irrelevant and distracting fanfare about Trump and Giuliani. Federal prosecutors\u2019 investigation into Giuliani\u2019s dealings in the Ukraine remains active and an independent court-appointed \u201cspecial master\u201d is reviewing materials seized in a raid of Giuliani\u2019s home and office in April. Who's who in the Giuliani-Ukraine search warrants? Prosecutors are expected to kick off testimony with Joe Ahearn, a top official at America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC that received $325,000 in donations at issue in the alleged straw donor scheme. Ahearn will likely speak to efforts by Parnas to make donations in time to get invites to events and access to Trump, Parnas\u2019 lawyer, Joseph Bondy, said in court. Lawyers involved in the case say other witnesses include Felix Vulis, a Russian businessman and former chief executive of Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. in connection with the cannabis business;  former Rep. Pete Sessions\u2019 former chief of staff; current and former FEC attorneys; two Nevada politicians, Adam Laxalt, Nevada\u2019s then attorney general and gubernatorial candidate, and Wesley Duncan, a less prominent politician in the state; an attorney who helped Parnas register a cannabis business in the state; and a law firm associate who aided Parnas\u2019 filings with the Federal Election Commission. Two names that will be on emails and text exchanges but physically absent from the trial include Fruman, who pleaded guilty last month to one count related to the scheme to solicit a contribution from a foreign national. Fruman originally faced several charges in multiple federal indictments but struck a plea deal that did not require him to cooperate with prosecutors. He faces up to five years in prison and is scheduled to be sentenced in January. The other name is David Correia, another business associate indicted with the other men. He is currently serving a one-year sentence after pleading guilty to charges last October for defrauding investors in Fraud Guarantee, a company he ran with Parnas from 2012 to 2019. He is not cooperating and is expected to be released in January. The Securities and Exchange Commission leveled a civil suit against Parnas and Correia in connection to the alleged Fraud Guarantee scheme, according to the lawsuit filed in federal court in February. Correia settled the case with the SEC but counsel for Parnas continues to litigate the suit on his behalf. Despite being known for touting his wealth and connections to Trump\u2019s circle of high rollers, Parnas told the court this month that he\u2019s out of cash to pay his lawyer. Oetken granted Parnas relief, ruling that the government will arrange or pay for his travel from his Florida home and his attorney will be reimbursed for lodging expenses at the government per diem rate. The trial is expected to last about two weeks.",

            "article_content": "Matt Dolan is a rare Republican candidate these days: a moderate conservative more interested in talking about infrastructure than in litigating the 2020 presidential election. A US Senate candidate in Ohio, Dolan has criticized former President Donald Trump directly for his lies about that election. He has said he would have voted to count the votes on January 6. And, uniquely among the leading Republicans vying for the nomination in Ohio, he has refused to say President Joe Biden\u2019s victory was tainted by widespread voter fraud. In a party currently dominated by an unquestioning devotion to Trump, Dolan is testing the premise that no one can get through a primary contest without embracing the former President. Some Ohio Republicans say Dolan\u2019s rejection of Trump naturally limits his appeal to a GOP primary electorate \u2013 particularly as some of the leading candidates are tying themselves to the former President as much as they can. But people familiar with Dolan\u2019s campaign insist there is unmet demand among Republican primary voters for a candidate untethered to Trump. Dolan is counting on that share of the party to be big enough to win a plurality in a crowded field \u2013 and be better positioned to face the likely Democratic nominee, the well-funded US Rep. Tim Ryan, in the general election. Across the country, establishment Republicans are watching Dolan\u2019s race for signs of post-Trump life. That includes donors, the group in the GOP tent most open right now to moving the party past the Trump era. \u201cThose who were Trumpers before are still with Trump, and those who were anti-Trump are looking for candidates to support,\u201d said Fred Zeidman, a Texas-based Republican donor. \u201cCan (non-Trump candidates) win? We don\u2019t know.\u201d But, Zeidman added, \u201cI think that anti-Trumpers are more passionate this time than they were last time.\u201d A state senator in his second term, Dolan is trying to sell himself as the natural successor to US Sen. Rob Portman. The retiring Republican senator has occasionally found himself crosswise of Trump, either temperamentally or on issues like trade and certifying the 2020 election. In 2016, Portman won more votes in his reelection bid than Trump did in Ohio and represents a center-right tradition Dolan\u2019s team believes can still win in the state. \u201cHe\u2019s in the McCain lane, the Romney lane, the Portman lane, the Voinovich lane, the DeWine lane,\u201d said one person familiar with the Dolan campaign\u2019s approach. But the state\u2019s shift from perennial swing state to a Republican redoubt has many GOP operatives there skeptical that a non-Trumpian stand can win in Ohio. Trump, after all, increased his share of the vote in Ohio in 2020. \u201cYou can\u2019t win a primary just by trying to be Portman,\u201d said one Republican strategist familiar with Ohio politics. Better to be more like Trump, the thinking goes. The other major GOP candidates in Ohio \u2013 Josh Mandel, Jane Timken, J.D. Vance, Mike Gibbons and Bernie Moreno \u2013 are all itching for the Trump nod. Several of them flew down to Mar-a-Lago to meet with Trump directly earlier in the year and pitch themselves. By contrast, Dolan is making no efforts to receive Trump\u2019s endorsement. What\u2019s more, the former President made it clear he isn\u2019t willing to give it in a statement last month regarding the forthcoming name change to baseball\u2019s Cleveland Indians, which Dolan co-owns with his family. \u201cAnybody that changes the name of the once storied Cleveland Indians to the Cleveland Guardians should not be running for the United States Senate representing the Great People of Ohio,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn any event, I know of at least one person in the race who I won\u2019t be endorsing. The Republican Party has too many RINOs!\u201d Dolan is hardly a supporter of Biden\u2019s. The GOP state senator has called himself a \u201cconservative who will stop Biden\u2019s agenda\u201d and has criticized the Democratic president\u2019s Covid vaccine orders, economic record and Afghanistan policy. But Dolan fails in the most important test for a Republican candidate: his willingness to call out Trump\u2019s 2020 election claims. As early as January 6, Dolan publicly decried Trump and other Republicans who \u201cperpetuated lies about the outcome of the November 2020 election.\u201d Saying so is a bridge too far for Republican candidates, says Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at the conservative National Review and a CNN contributor. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say the 2020 election was stolen in order to be a Republican in good standing in Trump\u2019s party. But you can\u2019t say Trump lost the election and then tried to undo the election because he was a sore loser,\u201d said Ponnuru. Besides Dolan, much of the Republican field in Ohio is stumbling over themselves to appeal to Trump and his base. Mandel, for instance, has increasingly adopted a quasi-Trumpian stridency on social media that has him making common cause with some January 6 protesters. Vance, meanwhile, has become a fixture on Fox News, espousing a populism aimed at the White working-class Trump base while atoning for his past opposition to Trump. Even Timken, the race\u2019s establishment representative, has emphasized her close ties to Trump, including how he supported her successful bid for Ohio GOP chair in 2017. Some in the party\u2019s establishment say Timken\u2019s accommodation of Trump gives her credibility with Republican voters but can present as palatable to a general electorate next November. \u201cI think there\u2019s a place in the primary for someone supportive of Trump who is not in crazyland,\u201d said an Ohio Republican operative. If Dolan hopes to succeed in the primary, however, he\u2019ll need a divided pro-Trump elecorate without the former President\u2019s endorsement. His team is hoping that by differentiating himself from the rest of the pack, Dolan can convince Republican voters to consider his post-Trump pitch. \u201cThey\u2019re all saying the same exact thing,\u201d said the person familiar with Dolan\u2019s campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s created a path for a candidate to get in who fits more of the traditional Republican mold.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "GOP Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio announced on Thursday that he will not seek reelection, becoming the first of the 10 House Republicans who had voted in January to impeach then-President Donald Trump to decide to retire. Trump has targeted the Republicans, trying to purge them from the party. \u201c1 down, 9 to go,\u201d Trump said in a statement after Gonzalez\u2019s announcement. The other nine House Republicans have also faced backlash, including from Trump, members of their party and primary challenge threats. But they\u2019re also well positioned in that their campaigns have raised in most races more money than their primary challengers. After Gonzalez\u2019s announcement, Rep. Liz Cheney, who had also voted to impeach Trump, tweeted, \u201cOn Constitution Day, Donald Trump\u2019s statement about Rep. Anthony Gonzalez reminds us all, once again, that Trump is at war with the Constitution.\u201d In a statement announcing his decision, Gonzalez cited \u201ctoxic dynamics\u201d within the Republican Party. \u201cWhile my desire to build a fuller family life is at the heart of my decision, it is also true that the current state of our politics, especially many of the toxic dynamics inside our own party, is a significant factor in my decision,\u201d he said. Cheney has faced sharp criticism from Wyoming to Washington since voting to impeach Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection\u201d after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol on January 6 in attempt to stop Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election. Afterward, Cheney said Trump \u201csummoned,\u201d \u201cassembled\u201d and \u201clit the flame of this attack\u201d and that \u201cthere has never been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\u201d The Wyoming Republican Party then censured her, and, after she repeatedly called out Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d that the 2020 election was stolen, House Republicans ousted her from her leadership post as conference chair. Those moves sent a high-profile message about the Republican Party\u2019s priorities, its ongoing loyalty to the former President and the limited extent to which it is willing to tolerate dissent. After a months-long search for a challenger to Cheney, Trump endorsed former Wyoming national Republican committeewoman Harriet Hageman last week. In an interview with CNN, Hageman, a former Cheney supporter, repeatedly declined to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the presidential election, saying, \u201cI think that there are legitimate questions about what happened during the 2020 election.\u201d Hageman also said she would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d have voted to impeach Trump, and that those who \u201ctrespassed or destroyed property should be held responsible for their own actions,\u201d rather than the former President, who she believed was not granted proper \u201cdue process.\u201d Kinzinger has been in the national spotlight often since his impeachment vote and has become a leading critic of the Republican Party\u2019s embrace of Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d and other conspiracy theories. The Illinois Republican launched a political action committee as part of an effort he\u2019s calling \u201cCountry First\u201d that seeks to counter the GOP\u2019s embrace of conspiracy theories and the former President. The effort has already run into challenges. He recently endorsed a Texas GOP congressional candidate, Michael Wood, who ran unsuccessfully in a crowded field on a platform calling for Republicans to turn away from Trump and reject conspiracy theories. \u201cI think what\u2019s important is that people see there are people out there that support you, that will back you if you do the right thing,\u201d Kinzinger told CNN of the endorsement. \u201cIt\u2019s a long-term battle for the soul of the party.\u201d Kinzinger has been censured by several county GOP organizations in Illinois and drawn a pro-Trump primary challenger, Catalina Lauf, who has said she is running against him, arguing that he \u201cbetrayed his constituents\u201d and criticizing his impeachment vote. John Katko has faced criticism from Trump and local GOP leaders in his home state of New York as a result of his impeachment vote. But he has displayed a unique ability to win his district even though Democratic presidential nominees have carried it. In the run-up to the vote to oust Cheney from her position as the No. 3 House Republican, Katko said he would support GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik, another New York lawmaker. \u201cI have every confidence that Elise will be a superb leader for all of our conference, not just some,\u201d Katko told The Auburn Citizen, though he also called Cheney \u201ca good friend.\u201d The congressman has stood by his impeachment vote, telling CNN in February, \u201cHell no,\u201d when asked if he had any regrets over the vote to impeach Trump. In August, John Murtari, a software engineer and an Air Force veteran, became the first Republican to challenge Katko. In September, Trump endorsed Michigan state Rep. Steve Carra in a challenge to Upton, who the former President labeled a \u201cRINO,\u201d or \u201cRepublican in name only.\u201d Trump specifically noted that Upton had voted for impeachment in making his endorsement, and said, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve to keep his seat.\u201d Upton has also faced rebukes from Republicans at the state-level following his impeachment vote. When he announced he would vote to impeach, Upton said in a statement, \u201cThe Congress must hold President Trump to account and send a clear message that our country cannot and will not tolerate any effort by any President to impede the peaceful transfer of power from one President to the next.\u201d In Herrera Beutler\u2019s home state of Washington, the state\u2019s Republican Central Committee passed a resolution condemning Trump\u2019s impeachment \u201cwithout question or exception\u201d and expressing disappointment at the congresswoman and Rep. Dan Newhouse, another Washington Republican who voted to impeach. The congresswoman defended her vote to CNN in February, saying, \u201cWhen push comes to shove, I\u2019m gonna stand with the Constitution, which is why I actually I\u2019m at peace with it.\u201d Herrera Beutler also said that she\u2019s \u201cnot worried\u201d about a potential primary challenger. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Republicans who disagreed with me on it, and I totally respect that,\u201d Herrera Beutler said at the time. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect you to agree with them on everything, but they want to be able to trust you.\u201d One challenger, Joe Kent, a retired US Army Special Forces officer and Gold Star husband, told CNN in July: \u201cI think Trump won, but I want to prove it.\u201d He has described himself as an \u201cAmerican First Republican\u201d and has taken on the congresswoman specifically over her impeachment vote, saying that she \u201cno longer represents our community\u2019s values.\u201d He is speaking at a right-wing rally on September 18 supporting those who attacked the Capitol on January 6. \u201cAll Americans are entitled to due process, the J6 political prisoners have been deprived of this for 9 months,\u201d Kent told CNN. \u201cAll Americans should be outraged that this is happening and that so few of our political leaders have spoken up against this.\u201d Despite pushback he has faced, Newhouse told CNN in February he does not have regrets about his vote. \u201cCan I say that\u2019s a dumb question?\u201d the congressman said when asked if he has any after receiving backlash from Trump supporters. \u201cI do not regret it.\u201d At the end of January, Newhouse rebuffed a call for his resignation from a number of county GOP leaders. \u201cI am not resigning,\u201d Newhouse said, according to the Spokesman-Review. \u201cMany Republicans have agreed with my vote, and many have disagreed. For those who disagree with me on this issue, I hope they will remember my lifelong support for conservative causes and values.\u201d Newhouse also faces the threat of a primary challenge. One Republican opponent looking to unseat him, Loren Culp, has stressed his support of Trump and says on his campaign website the district \u201cshould be represented by a constitutional conservative who will always put America First.\u201d But Culp has only raised roughly $23,000, according to the latest available FEC data, far less than what Newhouse has raised. Meijer has been censured by GOP county groups, and Tom Norton, the third-place finisher in a 2020 primary won by Meijer in western Michigan, has said he is running again, citing the congressman\u2019s impeachment vote. Meijer has spoken out about his concerns over the future of the Republican Party in the wake of January 6. In an interview with CNN earlier this year, Meijer expressed concern that baseless conspiracy theories like QAnon will destroy the GOP from within if Republicans don\u2019t decisively and unequivocally condemn the false and dangerous beliefs and take action to stop their spread. \u201cWhen we say QAnon, you have the sort of extreme forms, but you also just have this softer, gradual undermining of any shared, collective sense of truth,\u201d Meijer said. The Michigan freshman believes conspiracy theories fuel \u201cincredibly unrealistic and unachievable expectations\u201d and \u201ca cycle of disillusionment and alienation\u201d that could lead conservative voters to sit out elections or, in a worst-case scenario, turn to political violence, like what happened on January 6. Rice has also faced headwinds in his home state over his impeachment stance, and a number of Republicans launched campaigns to take his seat representing a red district in the northeast part of the state. The South Carolina Republican Party voted in January to formally censure Rice, who had not been expected to vote for impeachment but who explained after his vote that the President\u2019s response to the riot led him to vote alongside the chamber\u2019s Democrats. Rice told CNN in February he stood by his vote. \u201cIn eight years in Congress, I probably had a hundred votes that I could have gone either way, and I maybe second-guessed a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not one of them.\u201d Valadao of California has also had to grapple with the threat of a primary challenge in a swing district. The \u201cissues\u201d page on a website launched by candidate Chris Mathys, a former Fresno city councilman, includes just three sentences targeting the congressman\u2019s impeachment vote. But Mathys, who said he believes that Trump won the 2020 election, raised just $12,300 in the second quarter of 2021, and gave his campaign a $100,000 loan. Valadao raised over $482,000 during those three months, and had on hand nearly $820,000 \u2013 quadruple Mathys\u2019 figure.",

            "article_content": "The effort to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom took off last year amid a backlash to his aggressive restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. But when the last ballots are cast in Tuesday\u2019s special election, it may be the fears about the surge of the Delta variant that allow him to keep his job. For more than a year, the Covid-19 pandemic has been the dominant theme in the Republican-led effort to oust the Democratic governor \u2013 and it is still the central factor in the closing days of this race. Day after day in his ads and his public appearances, Newsom frames the recall vote as a \u201clife and death\u201d choice for voters, while his leading GOP opponent, conservative talk radio host Larry Elder, promises to do away with Newsom\u2019s mask and vaccine mandates as one of his first acts in office. Ironically, it\u2019s that contrast on the issue that at first seemed to make Newsom most vulnerable that has shifted the trajectory of the race in his favor. In late July and early August, California Democratic leaders were worried as the polls tightened and Newsom appeared to be in trouble. Despite running in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2 to 1, his party\u2019s voters were disinterested in the recall, while Republicans were enthusiastic as Elder emerged as the GOP frontrunner to replace the governor.   But around that same time, the highly contagious Delta variant was taking hold in California and across the nation. Cases in children began rising at an alarming rate just as parents were preparing to send them back to school. The power of governors came into sharper focus as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, both Republicans, tried to prevent school districts from enforcing mask mandates in schools. Suddenly the prospect of a governor like Elder, who might eliminate pro-active measures that have helped mitigated the surge, seemed frightening to many Democratic voters who might have otherwise sat out the special election. In the most recent polling from the Public Policy Institute of California, only 39% of likely voters said they would vote \u201cyes\u201d on recalling Newsom, while 58% said they\u2019d vote \u201cno.\u201d A majority of voters would have to support the recall effort in order for it to be successful, but if it does succeed, a replacement candidate could win with a mere plurality. Newsom\u2019s advisers note that he played \u201coffense rather than defense\u201d on the Delta variant and that they were able to run on policy by highlighting his aggressive approach to stopping the spread of the virus rather than shying away from it \u2013 a message that national Democrats have helped him deliver in the final weeks of the race. For Vice President Kamala Harris, who was with the governor on Wednesday, and President Joe Biden, who unveiled new vaccine mandates Thursday and is expected to visit the state on Monday, leaning into the Democratic governor\u2019s management of the pandemic is also a defense of their own strategy and a test of the party\u2019s messaging heading into a midterm election year. Elder has tried to channel the anger at Newsom, who was hazed by his opponents as \u201ca tyrant\u201d during the height of the pandemic last year, by pledging to make his first action as governor the repeal of Newsom\u2019s mask mandates and required testing for state workers. He often, to applause at his events, pledges to do this before he has his \u201cfirst cup of tea\u201d as governor \u2013 something Newsom has mocked him for. Elder and other GOP candidates have repeatedly reminded voters about Newsom\u2019s unmasked visit to an elite Napa Valley restaurant last November for a birthday party at a time when he was urging Californians to stay home and avoid large gatherings outside their household \u2013 a mistake Newsom acknowledged and apologized for. While Elder says he has been vaccinated because of his age and an \u201cunderlying co-morbidity,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday in Los Angeles that more people should accept and respect other Californians who choose not to get vaccinated. \u201cWhat I\u2019m opposed to are vaccine mandates and face mask mandates,\u201d Elder said. When pressed on whether he, as governor, would punish businesses that have mask or vaccine mandates, the Republican demurred and said he didn\u2019t believe his power would extend that far. \u201cI do believe that virtually everybody in California who wants to be vaccinated has been able to be vaccinated,\u201d Elder said. \u201cIf you\u2019re poor, you can get vaccinated for free. A lot of people have made a very different decision. And I think we ought to respect that decision.\u201d Newsom, by contrast, warned at a Wednesday rally with Harris that Elder would \u201cwalk us off that same Covid cliff as Texas, and Florida, Tennessee and Alabama and Georgia,\u201d where cases have been surging among unvaccinated people. Newsom nationalizes California recall as he fights for his job \u201cIt\u2019s true California has among the lowest case rates in America, and among the highest vaccination rates in America. Because we believe in science, we believe in public health,\u201d Newsom continued. \u201cAll that is on the ballot in the next week.\u201d The Democratic governor hammered that message again at an appearance in Fresno Thursday: \u201cThe consequences couldn\u2019t be more pronounced; couldn\u2019t be more sharp. This is about life and death.\u201d Last year, it was not just Republicans, but also some Democrats and independents, who were frustrated by what they viewed as erratic Covid protocols from the governor that were confusing and hard to follow \u2013 including a four-tiered, color-coded system that he ultimately abandoned that guided phased re-openings of everything from shopping centers to places of worship. Many parents also felt Newsom had catered too much to the teachers\u2019 unions and did not do enough to get schools reopened during the 2020-2021 academic year. For all of the complaints about Newsom\u2019s Covid shutdowns and varying regulations last year, the majority of Californians agree with him \u2013 not his GOP rivals \u2013 on mask and vaccine mandates. And there is a growing fury among some vaccinated Californians about how the unvaccinated are putting them and their children in danger. As of Thursday, 56.8% of Californians were fully vaccinated and the seven-day case positivity rate was 4.5%, according to the California Department of Public Health. In a CBS News/YouGov poll in early August, 67% of Californians said private businesses or employers should be allowed to mandate vaccines for their employees and 69% said vaccines should be mandatory for health care workers. In Public Policy Institute of California\u2019s recent survey, Californians named Covid-19 as the top issue facing the state, outpacing jobs and the economy, homelessness and housing. Among likely voters, 58% approved of the way Newsom was handling the coronavirus outbreak. As Newsom has nationalized the race and warned that California could go the way of Florida and Texas, so too have the top Democrats who have come to the governor\u2019s defense. Rallying for the governor last weekend, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren framed the race as a \u201clife and death choice\u201d where the \u201cconsequence can\u2019t be more pronounced\u201d because of the coronavirus. Harris on Wednesday lauded Newsom as someone who \u201cstepped up to the moment\u201d on Covid and \u201cdid not say this problem is too big for me.\u201d And former President Barack Obama, in an ad released on Wednesday, said the race was as a decision \u201cbetween protecting our kids and putting them at risk\u201d of getting Covid. \u201cGovernor Newsom has spent the past year and a half protecting California communities,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow Republicans are trying to recall him from office and overturn common-sense Covid safety measures for health care workers and school staff.\u201d Obama says California recall vote is difference 'between protecting our kids and putting them at risk' in new TV ad The strategy gets at something Democrats have believed from the outset of the race: While anger at Newsom over Covid may have fueled the recall fire, Californians would ultimately side with him when deciding who would best handle decisions about their health and the health of their families. Conversations with Newsom supporters at his events have highlighted this. \u201cA huge part of it for me, and for other people I know, is Covid,\u201d said Kayla Dobson, a 33-year-old who lives in Los Angeles and is supporting Newsom. \u201cIt is really Covid. It is so clear \u2013 obviously with a lot of political issues there is so much nuance, but with Covid it is really unnuanced in a lot of ways. \u2026 I am not a single-issue voter, but on this I can be a single-issue voter.\u201d Even Cindy Mediavilla, a 67-year-old Democrat who voted against Newsom in the 2018 gubernatorial election, said she believes he has done a \u201cvery admirable job as governor\u201d when it comes to tackling the virus. \u201cFor me, the whole four years under the previous White House administration \u2013 a person whose name I never mention \u2013 living in California was like \u2018thank God we live here, in a sane state,\u2019\u201d Mediavilla said. \u201cSo just the idea of a Republican in Sacramento, I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As Sen. Ron Johnson grapples with whether to run for a third term, it seems there\u2019s no controversy the Wisconsin Republican is unwilling to wade into. \u201cThe science tells us that vaccines are 95 percent effective. So if you have a vaccine, quite honestly, what do you care if your neighbor has one or not?\u201d Johnson told conservative radio host Vicki McKenna in April. \u201cSo why is this big push to make sure everybody gets a vaccine?\u201d At a GOP gathering in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, in early June, Johnson dismissed climate change. \u201cI don\u2019t know about you guys, but I think climate change is \u2013 as Lord Monckton said \u2013 bullsh*t,\u201d Johnson said, mouthing the expletive and referencing British conservative climate change denier Lord Christopher Monckton. \u201cBy the way, it is.\u201d And the senator recently suggested \u2013 without any evidence \u2013 that the FBI had more inside knowledge than it let on about Capitol insurrection. \u201cI don\u2019t say this publicly,\u201d Johnson told constituents in late July. \u201cSo you think that the FBI had fully infiltrated the militias in Michigan and they didn\u2019t know squat about what\u2019s was happening on January 6 and what\u2019s was happening with these groups?\u201d Johnson\u2019s outspoken takes have run the gamut from vaccine skepticism to climate change denialism to downplaying the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. His evolution from a conservative businessman to two-term senator apparently willing to deny facts and spread conspiracies has left some in the state wondering: What happened to Ron Johnson? Johnson declined an interview for this story. In response to questions from CNN, his spokeswoman Alexa Henning said the senator is pro-vaccine, but believes researchers should also look at therapeutics like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine, even though they have not proven effective in treating Covid-19 and can have dangerous side effects. Johnson has insisted he\u2019s not a climate change denier, although he has a long track record of questioning humans\u2019 role in climate change, which runs counter to the scientific consensus.  And when it comes to the FBI\u2019s knowledge of January 6, \u201cThe senator is simply asking questions that many don\u2019t want to hear or answer,\u201d Henning said, a common explanation from the senator when he is wading into views that run counter to expert consensus. \u201cThe senator continues to call on the FBI and DOJ to be transparent. To date, they have not been.\u201d Mark Becker, the former head of the Brown County Republican Party, is one of a handful of Republicans in the state who have not only turned against former President Donald Trump but also against Johnson. \u201cHe was our guy,\u201d Becker said of Johnson in an interview. \u201cHe was hyper-focused on the national debt, and he was the budget guy. He came to our events, and he was so well-liked. And he, it seemed, had a pretty good grasp on reality, and then Trump happened.\u201d While Becker supported Johnson\u2019s first Senate run in 2010, he was actively campaigning against Johnson and Trump by 2016. When the 2020 election rolled around, Becker was persona non grata in Johnson\u2019s world. But Becker was so frustrated to see Republicans, including Johnson, casting doubt on the 2020 election results that he reached out to Johnson anyway. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018He\u2019s not going to call me back, but I\u2019ll leave him a message and we\u2019ll leave it at that.\u2019 Well, then he called back, and I was like, \u2018Holy sh*t,\u2019\u201d Becker said. Becker said he expressed his concerns about the doubt Republicans were sowing around the 2020 election results. \u201cI said, \u2018Ron, Joe Biden won the election.\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, but 1.5 million people voted for Donald Trump. I\u2019m not stupid. I\u2019m not going to piss those people off,\u2019\u201d Becker said. \u201cSo it\u2019s like, okay, so serve them red meat, lie to these people, and then you can save face and you can say, \u2018I had his back.\u2019\u201d Becker went on to write a column about his phone call with Johnson and continued to press the senator to publicly stand up for the integrity of the 2020 election results. The day after the insurrection at the US Capitol, Becker says he got a response. \u201cHe said, \u2018Mark. It is my sincere hope to never have to see or speak to a lowlife weasel such as yourself again. Please stop trying to contact me,\u2019\u201d Becker said, sharing the message with CNN. \u201cSo, they\u2019re still picking up glass on the floor of the Capitol and that\u2019s what he\u2019s concerned about. It tells a lot.\u201d According to Johnson\u2019s spokeswoman, the senator has said Becker called him \u201cunder false pretenses. I was kind enough to engage in a lengthy conversation with him that I had every expectation would remain private. Months later, he went public with what he claims the conversation was about and what I had said. Anyone who would do that is a low-life weasel, and nothing they say should be given any credence.\u201d A number of former Johnson allies have found themselves aghast at the senator\u2019s behavior around the 2020 election. \u201cI think that he\u2019s the same in some ways but a little more disappointing,\u201d one former staffer said of Johnson\u2019s political evolution. The most disappointing part being his actions surrounding the election, the former staffer said. Johnson \u2013 then the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee \u2013 held a hearing in December highlighting what he claimed were many \u201cirregularities\u201d during the 2020 election. \u201cHe would say, \u2018I\u2019m just asking questions,\u2019 but framing that as a way to almost keep spreading the big lie about elections,\u201d the former Johnson staffer said. \u201cThat was the time when we needed people to most step up and say the election was legitimate. He of all people should have been in a position to say he knew how these elections worked and everything went right.\u201d Johnson made headlines again this week when a liberal activist secretly filmed the senator admitting Trump lost the state of Wisconsin. \u201cThe only reason Trump lost Wisconsin is that 51,000 Republican voters didn\u2019t vote for him,\u201d Johnson said in the video. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing obviously skewed about the results. There isn\u2019t.\u201d But his private admission that Trump lost hasn\u2019t stopped him from publicly sticking by his claims of irregularities. \u201cThis supposed undercover recording by a Democrat political operative at a public event is consistent with what I\u2019ve been saying publicly on the 2020 election, no need for hidden cameras and secret recordings, if the press were honest they would accurately report that,\u201d Johnson said in a statement. \u201cThere were many irregularities that have yet to be fully explained, fully investigated, and solutions passed to restore confidence in future elections, which is why I held a Senate hearing on Dec. 16, 2020. I\u2019ve investigated many of the irregularities, explained some, and have not gotten answers on many.\u201d In the statement, Johnson noted that he acknowledged Biden as president-elect as far back as December 2020. He failed to note that after admitting Biden won, Johnson backtracked in January and was one of a handful of GOP senators who signed on to a January letter vowing to object to the Electoral College votes in \u201cdisputed states\u201d ahead of the January 6 certification. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean by objecting, by raising these issues that we\u2019re doing anything dangerous,\u201d Johnson said in a January Newsmax interview. \u201cThat\u2019s what drives me nuts in this process. My investigation\u2019s been termed dangerous. It\u2019s not dangerous, it\u2019s what\u2019s required.\u201d Two days later, a mob stormed the US Capitol. After that, Johnson voted to certify the results. As far as Michelle Litjens is concerned, Johnson is the same guy he was when she took him to give his first public speech at a Tea Party event in 2009. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a frank talker,\u201d said Litjens, who was already involved in Wisconsin GOP politics when she met Johnson and went on to serve in the state assembly. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t skirt around issues. He is not looking to make friends necessarily all the time. He wants to make a difference.\u201d Litjens invited Johnson, who ran a local plastics manufacturing company, to join a roster of speakers at the upcoming event. \u201cRon Johnson gets up to speak and he does not speak about business. He actually starts telling a story about how his daughter was born with a rare birth defect and how she wouldn\u2019t be alive today if they would not have been able to find a heart specialist to help his daughter, and that wouldn\u2019t be possible if we had government run healthcare,\u201d Litjens said. At a time when the GOP backlash to Obamacare was reaching a crescendo, the message resonated. \u201cWhen Ron spoke, you could\u2019ve heard a pin drop,\u201d Litjens said. \u201cWhen he did that, you just knew something special was happening.\u201d Even so, Litjens was skeptical when Johnson came to her months later and confided that he wanted to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Russ Feingold in the 2010 race. \u201cI said, \u2018Yeah, I don\u2019t think you really want to do that,\u2019\u201d Litjens said. \u201cRon is not political. He wasn\u2019t from politics. He ran a business. And a campaign is county fairs and dairy breakfasts and shaking hands. It\u2019s seven days a week, 24 hours a day.\u201d But Johnson was insistent, so Litjens helped him make inroads with conservative operatives and talk radio show hosts. That included an introduction to Charlie Sykes, then a prominent conservative radio host in Wisconsin, who helped Johnson gain name recognition in the state. Sykes, who has since soured on the senator, said this year he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d he ever supported Johnson. Back in 2010, though, Johnson crafted his campaign around being a Washington outsider who was dedicated to shrinking government, tackling the national debt and boosting economic growth. He poured millions of dollars of his own cash into his campaign and ran buzzy ads highlighting his manufacturing and accounting background. In one such ad, Johnson stands in front of a white board tallying the number of lawyers in the Senate at the time, compared to the number of manufacturers (zero) and accountants (one). \u201cThere are 100 members of the U.S. Senate,\u201d Johnson said in the ad. \u201cFifty-seven of them, including Russ Feingold, are lawyers. That\u2019d be fine if we had a lawsuit to settle. But we have an economy to fix.\u201d The strategy worked. Johnson won his first Senate race, ousting Feingold in a GOP wave election. Democrats were so convinced Johnson\u2019s victory was a fluke -that Feingold ran again in the 2016 race in an attempt to win back his seat. In the run up to the election, Johnson was lagging behind in public polls. \u201cAt one point, he\u2019d been kind of abandoned by his own party nationally in terms of funding,\u201d said Milwaukee Journal Sentinel Washington Bureau Chief Craig Gilbert, who has been covering politics since the 1980s and Johnson since he arrived in Washington. \u201cThat was something that I don\u2019t think he forgot very quickly. But everybody had kind of left him for dead politically.\u201d Once again, Johnson surprised political observers, notching his second victory, this time alongside Donald Trump. Political strategists and former staffers said Johnson always had an independent streak and an inclination to speak his mind, no matter how controversial the topic. But his surprise back-to-back victories may have only emboldened those instincts. \u201cHe came out of nowhere and people really doubted him and so he was always sort of used to that mindset, and 2016 did nothing but deepen that,\u201d a former staffer said. \u201cI think he came into the Senate feeling like he fought his way back from the dead, he\u2019d earned it, he owed nothing to anybody. And, you know that that has sort of continued to show itself ever since.\u201d To Johnson\u2019s critics, he appears to be a power-hungry politician that is willing to peddle conspiracies to keep his grasp on the Trump-loving base of the party. To them, Johnson\u2019s office offered a statement from the senator: \u201cI promised my constituents two things, that I would never vote with my re-election in mind and I would always tell the truth. Just because the mainstream media and their allies in the Democrat party don\u2019t like to be questioned does not mean I will stop holding them accountable.\u201d Johnson\u2019s allies, however, see him as a guy who has always stayed true to the GOP grassroots and remained eager to question the establishment. The issues may have shifted, but his allegiances have not, they said. \u201cBefore he was that guy on conservative talk and on TV, he was that guy, listening to conservative talk and yelling at the TV. He\u2019s still that guy,\u201d said a former staffer. \u201cHe\u2019s remained the same guy. And as he\u2019s developed these additional priorities, he hasn\u2019t ditched his old ones.\u201d Republican strategist Brian Schimming \u2013 one of the senator\u2019s many GOP allies in the state \u2013 said Johnson simply likes to raise questions and ensure different points of view are presented to the American public. \u201cFor Ron Johnson, for him, there\u2019s a lot of truth out there, let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d Schimming said. \u201cAnd he wants to make sure people are exposed to it.\u201d When it comes to Covid-19 vaccines, for instance, Johnson has questioned the safety of the vaccines and used public events to highlight rare adverse side effects. He has also touted alternative drugs like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin that have not proven effective in treating the virus. Days after the FDA warned Americans not to take ivermectin as a Covid-19 treatment, Johnson was back to touting it. \u201cI\u2019m very agnostic. I don\u2019t care what drug will work, try a bunch of them, particularly the ones that are safe,\u201d Johnson told Washington Times opinion editor Cheryl Chumley in a late August podcast, adding, \u201cThere\u2019s growing evidence that ivermectin can be effective.\u201d Johnson has also repeatedly warned of the risk of death from the vaccines, often citing data that shows thousands died in the days after vaccination. That data, though, is unverified and does not prove a causal effect between vaccination and death. \u201cIf you question anything about January 6 or if you question anything about the Covid pronouncements from the Covid gods, you are a potential domestic terrorist,\u201d Johnson told conservative radio host Vicki McKenna in late August. \u201cSo I guess I\u2019m double that.\u201d Henning, the senator\u2019s spokeswoman, said the senator is an advocate for early treatments. While serious negative reactions to the vaccines are extremely rare, Henning said the senator believes those who experience them \u201chave the right to be seen, heard and believed, especially by federal health authorities who to date do not seem to have taken adverse events seriously.\u201d And she said the senator believes the death tallies he so often cites \u201cshould be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.\u201d But as US health officials continue to battle vaccine hesitancy \u2013 an issue that has been more pronounced among Republicans \u2013 they have warned that false claims about the vaccine are only making it more difficult to convince Americans to get the shot. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard false claims that Covid-19 vaccines cause infertility, contain microchips and cause Covid-19. And worse, we\u2019ve heard false claims that thousands of people have died from the vaccine,\u201d Dr. Peter Marks, director of the US Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in late August. \u201cLet me be clear: These claims are simply not true. Getting a Covid-19 vaccine can save your life.\u201d During Johnson\u2019s last race, he vowed to the voters that he was a two-term kind of guy. \u201cI\u2019m gonna serve one more term. That\u2019s it. Two terms. More than enough time! 12 years. Feingold\u2019s there for 18 years!\u201d Johnson said at a 2016 campaign event. Lately, he\u2019s been wavering on that promise, still undecided on whether he will seek a third term. If he does, seasoned political observers were split on Johnson\u2019s reelection odds. \u201cIt\u2019s unusual to have a member of the Senate from a 50-50 state as conservative as Ron Johnson is, and it\u2019s probably even a little bit more unusual to be as, kind of, much of a lightning rod,\u201d the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u2019s Gilbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily great general election politics to be, kind of, to be where Ron Johnson has been on some of these issues.\u201d There\u2019s no doubt Wisconsin is a battleground state. It went for former President Barack Obama twice before flipping to Trump\u2019s column in 2016, only to trend blue again for Biden in 2020.  And between Johnson and Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin, there is perhaps no other state with such philosophically opposite representation in the Senate. A former Johnson staffer said people don\u2019t fully grasp the state\u2019s political landscape \u2013 and that leads them to underestimate Johnson\u2019s appeal. \u201cThe reality is that Wisconsin is not a purple state. Wisconsin is two states: A red state and a blue state, with deeply hardened bases, and then a very thin sliver of the swing vote,\u201d the former staffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that people have understood in Wisconsin for a long time, which is that you maximize your base as much as possible, and you find a way to carve off that swing vote.\u201d Johnson\u2019s allies bet that Wisconsin voters will see beyond the raft of negative headlines he\u2019s faced recently. When he generates controversy, they say he simply likes to ask questions. And they blame the media, saying he\u2019s being taken out of context. \u201cI think the people of Wisconsin appreciate that Ron Johnson is a straight shooter,\u201d said Ben Voelkel, Johnson\u2019s former communications director. \u201cThey might not always agree with him, but what he told them the first time he ran and how he continues to act is that he\u2019s always going to be straight with them.\u201d For Democrats in Wisconsin, Johnson\u2019s straight talk is easy campaign ammunition. Nearly a dozen Democrats have jumped in the race for Johnson\u2019s seat, including high-profile names like Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin\u2019s Treasurer Sarah Godlewski and Milwaukee Bucks executive Alex Lasry. And they\u2019re already using his words against him. Earlier this year, Johnson went on a media tour insisting he never felt threatened on January 6. \u201cI knew those were people that loved this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law. So, I wasn\u2019t concerned,\u201d Johnson said on the Joe Pags Show. \u201cHad the tables been turned, and President Trump won the election, and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned.\u201d Johnson\u2019s office said he has condemned the violence on January 6, but he distinguishes those who stormed the Capitol from those who engaged in legal protests. Still, Godlewski has already used a portion of those remarks in an ad against him. Barnes also took aim at Johnson\u2019s remarks, telling CNN, \u201cHe\u2019s a person who has morphed into the guy who\u2019s gonna say the racist part out loud. We\u2019re talking real Archie Bunker here now, on top of the conspiracy theories.\u201d There\u2019s little sign Democrats plan to let up. \u201cI feel that, honestly, he says these things in order to get attention, to bring attention to himself. Because he hasn\u2019t delivered for people,\u201d Barnes said. \u201cHe speaks his truth, and unfortunately, he\u2019s delusional.",

            "article_content": "Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb entered next year\u2019s Senate race on Friday as one of the most important and closely-watched Democratic primary contests of 2022 takes shape. With control of a Senate split between 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans hanging in the balance and history suggesting that the GOP enters 2022 with an advantage, since a first-term president\u2019s party typically loses seats in the midterms, Democrats have no room for error. The party is on defense in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire. It is also targeting Republican-held seats in Florida, North Carolina and Wisconsin. But Pennsylvania, where Republican Sen. Pat Toomey is retiring, represents perhaps Democrats\u2019 best chance at picking up a Senate seat next year. It\u2019ll take place at the same time Pennsylvania voters choose a new governor to replace term-limited Democrat Tom Wolf, and as the state\u2019s House delegation faces a shake-up with its ranks shrinking by one member after redistricting. In a campaign kick-off speech Friday at a union hall in Pittsburgh, Lamb demonstrated how he would approach the general election by hammering Republicans\u2019 willingness to entertain former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud. \u201cIf they will take such a big lie and place it at the center of their party, you cannot expect them to tell the truth about anything else,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cThey lie about the election, and they lie about your paycheck too. And your health care. They promise to give you a pay raise \u2013 they turn around and cut taxes for corporations. They promise to always protect preexisting conditions and then thy take the law that protects preexisting conditions and they try to repeal it. They spent a decade trying to repeal it.\u201d Several high-profile Democrats are already in the Senate contest: Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a favorite of some progressives; Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh, who is backed by EMILY\u2019s List; and state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta. Lamb, 37, enters the race with $1.8 million already in the bank and fits the mold of moderate Democrats who have been successful in the party recently. He has won three House races in a conservative southwest Pennsylvania district. Joe Biden, then a former vice president considering his own political future, was the only national Democrat to campaign with Lamb during his first campaign, saying ahead of the 2018 special election in which Lamb won his seat that the Marine veteran and prosecutor \u201creminds me of my son Beau.\u201d Lamb later became a surrogate for Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, and has largely followed Biden\u2019s more centrist approach to policy \u2013 though he\u2019s also had stand-out moments, including excoriating Republicans on the House floor following the January 6 riots at the Capitol. As he ramped up for a Senate run, Lamb held a virtual fundraiser with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. But Lamb has broken with Manchin on the filibuster, saying he thinks the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold needs to go. Still, multiple Democratic operatives involved in the race said Lamb will find himself fending off comparisons to Manchin \u2013 which might help him appeal to independents and moderate Republicans in a general election but could be damaging with primary voters. Fetterman, meanwhile, appears to be the race\u2019s early front-runner. Fetterman \u2013 who endorsed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic presidential primary but said his message was to \u201cvote blue, no matter who,\u201d as he stayed out of the 2020 contest \u2013 is a favorite of some progressives. He has also flexed his fundraising muscles, hauling in $2.5 million in 2021\u2019s second quarter with a total of $3 million in the bank. And with his victory in 2018, Fetterman, who entered the Senate race in February, is the only candidate who has already run and won statewide. The bald, goateed, work-shirt-wearing, 6-foot-8 Fetterman also cuts a larger-than-life figure. He has the zip code of Braddock, the old steel town where he was mayor from 2005 to 2019, tattooed on his left forearm; on his right forearm are the dates of every homicide that took place in Braddock while he was mayor. And he doesn\u2019t fit neatly into a political lane. Fetterman has long been socially liberal: He performed same-sex weddings before they were legally recognized in Pennsylvania, and has long advocated the legalization of marijuana \u2013 a potential key difference with Lamb, who has supported weed\u2019s decriminalization but not its legalization. He has pushed for a higher minimum wage. Fetterman has broken with progressives, though, by supporting fracking, saying that Democrats need to be honest about what it would take to fully transition to renewable energy. Fetterman\u2019s campaign argues that he is the candidate with the best chance to win statewide, pointing to donations from people in all 67 of Pennsylvania\u2019s counties and an average contribution of $28 \u2013 which means he\u2019ll have lots of room to turn small-dollar donors into a consistent stream of financial support throughout the race. \u201cPeople across the commonwealth are supporting John because he represents the necessary balance of electability and dependability for democratic ideals in the era of a closely divided Senate,\u201d said Fetterman campaign spokesman Joe Calvello. But Fetterman, 51, could be hounded throughout the race by a 2013 incident in which pulled a shotgun on an unarmed Black man who had been jogging because he believed the man had been involved in a shooting. There is also a rival for progressive support: Kenyatta, who is young at 31, Black and gay, and could draw support from Democratic voters interested in breaking barriers. The progressive Working Families Party endorsed Kenyatta; so have teachers\u2019 unions and the LGBTQ Victory Fund. Kenyatta endorsed Biden, served as a surrogate and was tapped as one of the party\u2019s rising stars for a video address at the Democratic National Convention. He has also built his profile through appearances on MSNBC. But he has struggled to be competitive in fundraising, bringing in just $500,000 in 2021\u2019s second quarter with just $280,000 left in the bank at the quarter\u2019s end. Meanwhile, EMILY\u2019s List, the powerhouse Democratic group that supports pro-choice women, endorsed Arkoosh, the chair of the board of commissioners in Montgomery County \u2013 the state\u2019s third-largest county. A doctor from the Philadelphia suburbs, Arkoosh, 54, could consolidate some of the support that would have gone to Reps. Madeleine Dean and Chrissy Houlahan, who both passed on the Senate race. Women make up a larger share of the Democratic primary electorate than men. \u201cAs a physician, public health advocate, and chair of Pennsylvania\u2019s third-largest county, Val has the experience, accomplishments, and perspective Pennsylvania Democrats are looking for,\u201d said Ben Ray, an EMILY\u2019s List spokesman. The race features geographic divides, with Lamb and Fetterman \u2013 a former mayor of Braddock, just outside of Pittsburgh \u2013 both coming from western Pennsylvania, and Arkoosh and Kenyatta representing the Philadelphia region on the state\u2019s eastern edge. It also offers voters opportunities to make history in a state that has only ever sent White men to the Senate. Kenyatta would be Pennsylvania\u2019s first Black and first openly gay senator. Arkoosh would be the state\u2019s first female senator, and the first female doctor ever elected from either party to the Senate. State Sen. Sharif Street, a 47-year-old who represents Philadelphia, is also considering a run, and like Kenyatta would become the first Black senator from the state. The field of Republican Senate hopefuls has been slower to develop and sluggish in fundraising. Montgomery County real estate developer Jeff Bartos and former Army Ranger Sean Parnell, who lost to Lamb in a House race last year, are the best-known candidates. Carla Sands, who was former President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to Denmark, entered the race last month. Sands could appeal to Trump supporters with Bartos and Parnell already brawling over previous statements criticizing the former president. Conservative author and pro-Trump pundit Kathy Barnette was a surprise in the most recent fundraising quarter, April through June, raising $595,000. She trailed only Bartos, who raised less from other donors but pumped $440,000 of his own money into his campaign in that period, allowing him to report about $1 million. \u201cCampaigns are marathons, but the Democrat candidates in Pennsylvania are already sprinting as far left as possible,\u201d National Republican Senatorial Committee spokeswoman Lizzie Litzow said. \u201cConor Lamb is just another extreme progressive liberal joining the other extreme progressive liberals. Lamb has voted 93% of the time with Nancy Pelosi and will be a rubber stamp for the dangerous liberal policies. The NRSC will spend every day highlighting their positions that are way out of step with the voters of Pennsylvania.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lawyers who attempted a class action lawsuit claiming voter fraud in the 2020 election were sanctioned by a federal judge in Colorado on Wednesday for the frivolous, meritless case, a major condemnation of pro-Donald Trump allies\u2019 attempts to use the courts to vet right-wing conspiracies. The attorneys \u2013 Gary D. Fielder and Ernest John Walker \u2013 that filed the election lawsuit in late December 2020 in Colorado federal court now must pay attorneys fees for Facebook, Dominion Voting Systems, the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Georgia and Wisconsin, and the non-profit Center for Tech and Civic Life, all of which were named as defendants in the lawsuit, Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter ruled. Neureiter wrote a scathing 68-page opinion condemning the post-election lawsuit, calling it an \u201cenormous conspiracy theory\u201d and potentially defamatory. The lawsuit had no lawyers or experts that were able to support the claims, the judge noted. ABC News: Trump loyalist at DOJ circulated draft Georgia letter with false election fraud claims The ruling on Wednesday marks the first major consequence in federal court to befall lawyers and litigants who pushed President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to undermine the 2020 election result in court. It could also play into several other proceedings where judges are considering reprimands for Trump\u2019s legal teams and those of his supporters. The states, Dominion, Facebook and the nonprofit are set to estimate their legal expenses by later this month so the judge can determine sanction payment amounts. Fielder and Walker did not immediately comment for this story. A claim in the lawsuit that Dominion had deleted votes for Trump was highly disputed, inflammatory and unverified, the judge also noted. Several other lawyers for President Donald Trump and his campaign repeated that claim in other court cases and are facing possible sanctions and punishment before other courts, and Dominion has sued for defamation. \u201cThe unique circumstances of this case, including the volatile conditions surrounding the 2020 election, the extremely serious and potentially damaging allegations against public servants and private entities, the remarkable request to declare void and ineffective the certification of the electoral votes of several states, along with an extraordinary money demand of $160 billion and the lack of any time pressure, meant that any reasonable pre-filing investigation needed to involve extensive due diligence and the testing of the allegations, including actually talking to human beings, such as the lawyers who filed the failed lawsuits and the experts who submitted affidavits. Under the circumstances of this case, Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel did not fulfill this obligation,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThe public statements from authoritative sources and courts rejecting allegations of widespread voter fraud or ballot-rigging should have been, if not bright red, at least flashing yellow lights warning Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to proceed with caution,\u201d Neureiter added. \u201cInstead, they drove through the lights at full speed, even accelerating.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The final weekend of campaigning for the primary in Ohio\u2019s 11th Congressional District brought to life the divisions that still exist deep inside the Democratic Party, despite broader signs of unity during the first six months of the Biden administration. Sen. Bernie Sanders was back on the campaign trail here, trying to push back against a coordinated effort from Democratic establishment groups working to defeat Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and progressive leader who was one of Sanders\u2019 top allies during his two failed presidential races. \u201cWhy are they spending millions of dollars trying to defeat her?\u201d Sanders said in an interview. \u201cThe answer is obvious. They are afraid of her.\u201d A week after New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for Turner in Cleveland, the Vermont senator made the journey to the Midwest to boost his longtime ally and partner on the presidential stump, where \u2013 in a reversal from those 2016 and 2020 campaigns \u2013 he introduced her. Like Ocasio-Cortez, he pleaded with voters to send Washington progressives another ally to boost their influence on Capitol Hill, where narrow Democratic majorities mean that every member of Congress has outsized leverage in the shaping of big-ticket legislation. Meanwhile, the top leadership of the Congressional Black Caucus fanned out across Cleveland to campaign for Turner\u2019s leading rival, Shontel Brown, the Cuyahoga County Democratic chairwoman and a county council member who has emerged in a field of 13 candidates. The race is being closely watched as another test for the party and a sign of whether more primaries could emerge in the 2022 midterm elections. Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House who became a kingmaker in Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign, is hoping to play a similar role in this contest. Clyburn told CNN that Biden needed all the allies he could get in the House. It was a less-than-subtle message that he and other congressional leaders are trying to defeat Turner, in large part to deny the progressive Squad another member. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people think that the entire agenda has got to be yours. That\u2019s not the way the world works,\u201d Clyburn told CNN. \u201cWe have to sit down, find common ground, reconcile the differences and move an agenda forward. That\u2019s what this President is doing and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so successful.\u201d The primary contest on Tuesday is to fill the vacant seat of former Rep. Marcia Fudge, who joined the Biden Cabinet to serve as the secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development. There\u2019s little doubt a Democrat will ultimately win the race, given the makeup of the district, which stretches across Cleveland and down to Akron, but the question is what kind of Democratic it will be. Turner is a progressive in the mold of Sanders, a stance for which she makes no apology. \u201cCongress is a co-equal body. It has power, too,\u201d Turner told CNN. \u201cMy job would not be to parrot any administration, whether it\u2019s a Democratic administration or a Republican administration. My job is to represent the interests of the people who elect me.\u201d Standing by her side during an interview on Saturday, Sanders added: \u201cShe is a fighter. They do not want her in the Congress.\u201d Sanders rejected the suggestion that Turner would be a thorn in the side of the Biden administration, pointing to himself as an example of how compromise can work. As chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Sanders is now a key player in negotiations surrounding the President\u2019s economic agenda. \u201cShe\u2019s a practical politician, like we all are,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey\u2019re not mutually exclusive. You have a vision, and you deal with the day-to-day realities.\u201d For her part, Turner is still dogged by a derisive comment she made about Biden after the heated presidential primary with Sanders more than a year ago. She suggested the choice between Biden and former President Donald Trump was negligible, comparing it to eating a half a bowl of excrement, rather than a full one. That statement, which originally came from an interview with The Atlantic in 2020, is plastered on billboards across Cleveland, with the four-letter word for excrement in large letters. The advertisements are paid for by a political action committee, Pro-Israel America. That group, along with others like Democratic Majority for Israel have spent heavily against Turner during the campaign and opposed other progressive primary candidates, including Sanders in the presidential contest. \u201cAt that moment, we all know that primaries are very heated,\u201d Turner told CNN on Saturday, explaining her comment, but stopping far short of apologizing. \u201cI am going to applaud the Biden administration, when they\u2019re moving in the right direction,\u201d Turner said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m also going to have the courage to ask for more for the people in my district, and those two things are not mutually exclusive. They go together.\u201d Anticipating the lines of attack that have since come her way, Turner has, in television ads, played up her connections to popular Democratic figures outside new leftist circles. One of her final spots makes note that she was a delegate for former President Barack Obama \u2013 twice \u2013 during his two presidential campaigns. Another early ad showed her sitting at Republican former Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2019s side as it touted her bipartisan work as a state senator. But Turner\u2019s comment about Biden \u2013 along with a litany of other remarks she has made over the years sharply critical of Democratic establishment leaders \u2013 is a central part of the argument against her candidacy. Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio, chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus who is among the leaders campaigning hard against Turner, said \u201cdignity and decency\u201d were on the ballot. She urged voters during weekend campaign stops in Cleveland to send Brown to Washington to help the Biden agenda. \u201cIt is a slim majority, and we need a team player,\u201d Beatty told CNN. \u201cWe need somebody who\u2019s willing to say they will set aside their own showmanship, their own ego, their own platform if inconsistent with the Democratic platform.\u201d New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus political action committee, took the argument a step further on Saturday, saying divisions in the party from Sanders\u2019 supporters had steep consequences. \u201cIf we had held together, Donald Trump never would have been,\u201d Meeks told an audience here, noting that Turner and others didn\u2019t back Hillary Clinton in 2016. Shortly after Clinton won the primary that year, Turner said, \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Democrat and I take great pride in that,\u201d but added, \u201cReally, it\u2019s the values of the Democratic Party I\u2019m fighting for, so I am a dedicated dissenter within the Democratic Party.\u201d (She turned down an invitation to be Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein\u2019s running mate.) Turner has sought to use the crush of endorsements from the Democratic establishment to portray her rival as a \u201cpuppet\u201d for the party. Brown, who has been endorsed by Clinton, sharply rejected that label, telling CNN she was \u201cexcited\u201d about the Biden administration and would work to represent the needs of her district. \u201cI would consider a puppet someone that\u2019s been on the national stage, delivering catchphrases like, \u2018Hello, somebody,\u2019\u201d Brown said, taking aim at a trademark line that Turner uses in speech after speech. \u201cI am a partner, who knows what it takes to sit at the negotiating table to get things done.\u201d The White House has not weighed in on the contest and Fudge has remained neutral, though her mother endorsed Brown and said in a television ad that Brown \u201cshares Marcia\u2019s values and will continue her legacy in Congress.\u201d But administration officials are watching the race carefully for early warning signs of the mood of the party and whether other primaries could even further complicate Democratic efforts to maintain their slim congressional majorities. More than $3 million in TV ads are flooding the airwaves here, from both campaigns and several outside groups seeking to influence the special election. Yet it\u2019s an open question how many voters are paying attention to the summer race \u2013 a point Sanders used to rally supports to the polls during his speech on Saturday, which also included remarks from Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson. \u201cMy suspicion is that here, in the middle of the summer in Cleveland, the voter turnout is probably going to be fairly low,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt means that every single vote counts.\u201d",

            "article_content": "For the briefest moment, amid an inferno of fury, mistrust, stunts and ill-faith, Congress actually worked. The Senate vote Wednesday on a bipartisan infrastructure deal was merely on opening debate on the plan, with legislative text yet to be released. But such tiny breakthroughs in Capitol Hill stalemate pass for huge success in a body that reflects, and now actively deepens, America\u2019s bitter national estrangement. The bill \u2013 based on a still fragile compromise wrought in weeks of talks \u2013 is a critical plank of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency as he seeks to show Americans that flailing, politicized Washington can still fix big things. In a treacherous path toward passage, the measure could still be derailed by Republicans intimidated by former President Donald Trump, who issued a vague threat of 2022 primaries against Republicans if the deal happened. It also needs the courage of more moderate GOP senators to survive, as the demands of progressive House Democrats threaten to blow it up. Here's what's in the bipartisan infrastructure bill While more than $1 trillion for roads and bridges and other physical infrastructure represents a critical investment, the symbolism of Wednesday\u2019s vote is more important. The President hopes it will validate the parable of his inaugural address \u2014 that \u201cpolitics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.\u201d Sadly, most current evidence suggests the opposite in a Congress consumed by its poisoned antagonism, where traditional ideological fractures are exacerbated by the trauma of the January 6 insurrection and the stress of the pandemic. On Wednesday alone, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado reportedly threw a mask back at a floor staffer who offered her one so that she could comply with the reinstatement of masking requirements, announced by the Capitol attending physician late Tuesday in light of new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance amid rising case numbers across the country. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is hardly maintaining the decorum expected of an office that is second in line to succeed the President. She described Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy as \u201csuch a moron.\u201d She was frustrated that her fellow Californian is leading his conference on a made-for-Fox-News crusade against masking guidelines with the kind of zeal that might be better employed urging Republican voters to get vaccinated. McCarthy had earlier turned masking into another culture war battle by accusing liberals of wanting \u201ca perpetual pandemic state.\u201d The modern House has featured some combustible political characters. But relations between the two leaders of the rival parties have never been this toxic in living memory. As petulance over masking burst out all over the House, GOP Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida and Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman of California got into a yelling match over the former\u2019s refusal to cover his face. \u201cThis rule is stupid. Let\u2019s just be very blunt about this,\u201d Donalds said, adding he had not been vaccinated but had recovered from Covid-19. House Republicans revolt over reimposed mask mandate Masks may not have been needed if the nearly half of House Republicans who have refused to publicly divulge their vaccination status would say whether they have actually gone ahead and gotten vaccinated, amid widespread skepticism of life-saving shots in states that Trump won. Wednesday\u2019s business further degenerated when GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas earned a standing ovation from pro-Trump Republicans, including noted conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, after he declared, \u201cThis institution is a sham. And we should adjourn and shut this place down.\u201d The Founders wanted the US House of Representatives, where members serve two-year terms, to foster what James Madison or Alexander Hamilton, the presumed authors of Federalist 52, called an \u201cintimate sympathy\u201d for the mood of the people. If America is mirrored by the current House, it is locked in an insoluble feud, ripped apart by the pandemic, and caught up in fierce, consequential fights that will decide who wields power and whether democracy survives. The infrastructure deal aside, Republicans and Democrats lack any common political language to forge the people\u2019s business. And the bitterness is personal. Wednesday\u2019s masking circus followed an extraordinarily tense and emotional day on Capitol Hill on Tuesday when four police officers beaten and abused by Trump\u2019s mob on January 6 encapsulated the still barely believable events of the day, when the country\u2019s age-old tradition of peaceful transfers of power was shaken. Their moving testimony revealed qualities of duty, patriotism, morality and courage that are so lacking in Trump\u2019s apologists in the House GOP. McCarthy, acting on Trump\u2019s wishes, did everything he could to scupper their chances to tell their stories in a depoliticized environment. Congressional failure does not rest on one party alone. But the repressive legacy of the insurrection is proving that much of the current extreme dysfunction is being driven by the House GOP\u2019s decision to abandon the defense of democratic principles to preserve Trump\u2019s personality cult. The opening of the select committee featuring the officers on Tuesday was accompanied by a gale of dishonesty and disinformation from GOP lawmakers covering for Trump\u2019s incitement of the invading mob. Rep. Elise Stefanik, the new third-ranking leader in the House GOP conference, has ridden arch fealty to Trump to power. She is now making absurd claims that the ex-President is not to blame for the worst attack on the US Capitol in 200 years but the speaker is. \u201cNancy Pelosi bears responsibility, as Speaker of the House, for the tragedy that occurred on January 6,\u201d the New York lawmaker said on Tuesday, ignoring the fact that Pelosi isn\u2019t in charge of security for the Capitol, and the obvious point that the ex-President perpetrated one of the worst assaults on US democracy. Several leading Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, said they did not watch Tuesday\u2019s hearings on the Capitol insurrection \u2013 a metaphor for their party\u2019s failure to impose accountability for the outrage. Congress \u2013 which typically enjoys rock bottom approval ratings \u2013 has always been an easy target. But there are still pockets of decency among the rascals and political hacks on Capitol Hill. Republican Reps. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Liz Cheney of Wyoming, for instance, are risking their political careers and defying McCarthy\u2019s boycott of the select committee to expose Trump\u2019s extremism and their own colleagues\u2019 cowardice. Kinzinger, who fought back tears in the committee\u2019s opening hearing when praising the officers, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday that his colleagues needed to get on the right side of history on the insurrection. \u201cIf somebody really thinks that this narrative of January 6 that some are trying to push is actually going to be the one written in the history books \u2013 it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just a question of when, is it sooner or later,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cBut it\u2019s coming. So I wouldn\u2019t want to be on \u2013 the one out there on TV pushing the \u2018Big Lie\u2019 and think somebody is going to eventually be proud of what I was doing.\u201d Much of the Senate was on Wednesday remembering the late Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi, who was as conservative as his state, but also sometimes sought friendly accommodation across the aisle, in a way that is now rare. \u201cI always saw him first as a public servant who conducted himself with decency, honor, and integrity,\u201d Biden said in a statement, remembering his former Senate sparring partner who died after a biking accident. McConnell, who is blamed by many Democrats for the fierce partisanship in the Senate after bending custom to build a conservative Supreme Court majority, is nevertheless making an important gesture to help end the pandemic. The polio survivor is using campaign funds to finance radio ads in his state of Kentucky to persuade holdouts to get the vaccine. In another sign that Senate chivalry is not dead, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, who pulled off a financial rescue of the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002, issued a statement defending US gymnast Simone Biles, who pulled out of several events at the Tokyo Games citing her mental health and faced attacks from some conservative pundits and online trolls. \u201cI love and admire Simone Biles and our Olympians \u2026,\u201d Romney wrote on Twitter. \u201cI take pride in them, not so much for the medals they win as for the grace, humanity & character of their hearts.\u201d Romney\u2019s comment was the latest reminder of his own humanity \u2013 and another sign that the relentless attack on his character, branding him a corporate vampire with no soul, by former President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign was a harsh one. But Romney came under fresh attack from another ex-President on Wednesday. Trump lacerated him as a \u201cSUPER RINO\u201d \u2013 an acronym for \u201cRepublican in name only\u201d \u2013 in his statement on the infrastructure deal. \u201cThis will be a victory for the Biden Administration and Democrats and will be heavily used in the 2022 election,\u201d Trump wrote, recreating the bile that once poured from his Oval Office. \u201cIt is a loser for the USA, a terrible deal and makes the Republicans look weak, foolish and dumb.\u201d Trump\u2019s vitriol and his capacity to dictate Republican opinion is one big reason why Wednesday\u2019s vision of a functioning Congress is just a mirage.

            "article_content": "To hear Donald Trump tell it, his endorsement is the equivalent to a golden ticket to Congress. \u201c88 and 2 (really 1) in ENDORSEMENTS this election cycle, and @FoxNews was critical,\u201d he tweeted in June 2020. \u201cHas anyone ever done so well? I doubt it!\u201d But as is so often true with Trump, the reality comes up well short of his boasts. While this isn\u2019t exactly an emperor-has-no-clothes situation, it\u2019s quite clear from a look at the numbers that the former president\u2019s endorsement record is far more spotty than he would like his party to believe. Tuesday night\u2019s special election in Texas\u2019 6th district provides simply the latest example of the overblown influence of a Trump endorsement. The billionaire businessman had endorsed Susan Wright, the wife of the late congressman. (Ron Wright died of Covid-19 in February.) \u201cSusan has my Complete and Total Endorsement,\u201d Trump said in a statement on July 21. \u201cShe will make our Country proud. Vote on Tuesday!\u201d And on Monday, Trump doubled down: \u201cBig election tomorrow in the Great State of Texas! Susan Wright supports America First policies, our Military and our Veterans, is strong on Borders, tough on Crime, Pro-Life, and will always protect our Second Amendment. She will serve the people in the 6th Congressional District of Texas, and our Country, very well. Susan has my Complete and Total Endorsement. \u201c THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Trump\u2019s Save America PAC put money behind those words, spending $100,000 on last-minute ads for her \u2013 and recording a robocall to help drive turnout for her. But Susan Wright lost to state Rep. Jake Ellzey. And it wasn\u2019t all that close \u2013 53% to 47%. That means that Trump\u2019s record in special elections so far in 2021 is 1-1. (He had previously endorsed Rep. Julia Letlow, who ran and won to replace her late husband who also died  of Covid-19.) Which, admittedly, is a pretty small sample size. But Ballotpedia has been keeping a running count of Trump endorsees \u2013 and their fates \u2013 which gives us a broader and better look at the former president\u2019s actual record. Ballotpedia breaks Trump endorsements into three categories: 1) General elections 2) Special elections 3) Battleground primaries (i.e., primaries that are competitive). Here\u2019s his record in each of those during the 2020 campaign: * General elections: 141-42 (77%) * Special elections: 3-2 (60%) * Battleground primaries: 21-2 (91%) Let\u2019s go through each of those categories. In general elections, Trump has always padded his stats by endorsing lots and lots of incumbents who face almost zero chance of losing. Trump did a LOT of this in the 2020 cycle. For example, he endorsed Rep. James Comer in Kentucky\u2019s 1st district; Comer won with 75% in a seat that Trump won by almost 50 points. No one thought Comer was losing. Trump\u2019s endorsement had nothing to do with that fact. Special elections are unique even within the world of campaign politics. They are often scheduled at odd times \u2013 late July in an off-year is not a traditional voting time in Texas, for example \u2013 and that produces low and odd turnouts. Any endorser, therefore, is going to struggle to make the right pick in special elections. They tend to be the gambling equivalent of a \u201cpick \u2018em\u201d \u2013 meaning no one really knows what\u2019s going to happen. The one place where it\u2019s clear that Trump\u2019s endorsement does matter is in contested Republican primaries. A 21-2 record is very, very good \u2013 and suggests that if Trump endorses you in a normally scheduled primary, you are very likely to win. Taken together, the numbers suggest that a Republican candidate \u2013 whether incumbent or challenger \u2013 still very much wants to have Trump\u2019s endorsement. But that endorsement isn\u2019t a guarantor of victory \u2013 no matter what Trump says.",

            "article_content": "A new political war over masks is already deepening the national divides that slowed vaccinations and thwarted what once seemed an imminent victory over the coronavirus pandemic. As soon as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rolled back indoor unmasking guidance on Tuesday for a majority of US counties amid surging new coronavirus cases, the ideological conflagration over face coverings roared back to life. Ex-President Donald Trump, in his latest attempt to damage his successor over a pandemic he himself basically ignored at the end of his own term while pushing his election lies, issued a statement saying, \u201cDon\u2019t surrender to COVID. Don\u2019t go back!\u201d If Trump\u2019s faithful followers accept his advice on ignoring mask guidance again, more of them will likely get sick and die. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, tweeted that a directive by the House\u2019s attending physician that masks now need to be worn again in all interior spaces of the chamber was not \u201cbased on science.\u201d Instead, he said, the decision was \u201cconjured up by liberal government officials who want to continue to live in a perpetual pandemic state.\u201d And in another high-profile clash, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is presiding over his state\u2019s explosion of Covid-19 cases, moved into conflict with President Joe Biden, resisting new CDC recommendations for masking in schools. Doctor: 'We've all lost patients here in the last few weeks' The showdown not only augured a new struggle between science and politics \u2013 a disconnect that has plagued efforts to beat the worst public health crisis in 100 years. It also unleashed a face-off with extra partisan dimensions since it could preview a possible 2024 presidential election duel between DeSantis and Biden. The latest GOP attacks were deeply ironic. Had more Republican leaders prioritized public health over politics and urged their voters to get vaccinated, the surge in new cases would likely have been avoided \u2013 meaning no reintroduction of measures to stem an again-accelerating pandemic. Only two months ago, the CDC said vaccinated people didn\u2019t have to wear masks indoors with the pandemic apparently in retreat. But on Tuesday, with the highly transmissible Delta variant raging, the top public health agency said that even vaccinated people in areas of \u201csubstantial\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d transmission of the coronavirus should mask up. And it said that everyone \u2013 staff, kids and visitors \u2013 should wear masks in K-12 schools when the summer break ends. The decision was taken in the context of new data showing that vaccinated people infected with the Delta strain can play a limited role in transmission, even if their chances of getting seriously ill and dying are still very low. The announcement that masking is back for many Americans came as a devastating blow to morale and could have significant political implications for a White House that made ending the pandemic this year its signature goal. New science leads to another CDC update on masks. Even for the vaccinated. New tensions over masks are also almost certain to exacerbate the disconnect between the White House, which is urging everyone to get life-saving vaccines, and pro-Trump states, where there is deep resistance to public health precautions even as the virus exacts a disproportionate toll. It will underscore the self-defeating reality that the people least likely to wear masks are often those most resistant to vaccines \u2013 a fact that is driving unnecessary new cases and deaths from the disease and now even restricting the lives of the vaccinated. Political controversy is likely to ratchet up another notch on Thursday, when Biden is expected to announce that all federal employees and contractors must be vaccinated or face regular testing regimens. The sign of a hardening White House line comes amid perceptible societal frustration among vaccinated Americans with those who refuse to get their shots. The most haunting realization after the CDC decision is that America, unlike many other areas of the world, has the means to end its pandemic \u2013 a plentiful supply of highly effective vaccines \u2013 but won\u2019t fully utilize it. \u201cWe would not be in this situation if we already had, now, the overwhelming proportion of the population vaccinated,\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, told \u201cPBS NewsHour.\u201d In a statement, Biden told the country he had unwelcome news but that he had promised to always level with citizens over the true state of the pandemic. He did offer reassurance that more mask-wearing and vaccinations would mean the country could forestall a full return to the nightmare of last year. \u201cUnlike 2020, we have both the scientific knowledge and the tools to prevent the spread of this disease. We are not going back to that,\u201d he insisted. Republican lawmaker defends fact he isn't getting vaccinated Biden also said that while masking in schools would be \u201cinconvenient\u201d it would allow kids to be able to learn and spend time with their classmates again. But DeSantis, who has frequently sought to spin political advantage from the pandemic, styling himself as the scourge of health guidance unpopular with conservatives, including on vaccine passports, quickly contradicted Biden\u2019s advice. \u201cGovernor DeSantis believes that parents know what\u2019s best for their children; therefore, parents in Florida are empowered to make their own choices with regards to masking,\u201d said DeSantis\u2019 spokesperson, Christina Pushaw. She claimed that data showed Covid-19 was not a serious risk to healthy children but that they were at risk of bacterial infections from masks and from difficulty breathing. The statement contradicts CDC evidence that shows more children have already died from the disease, 517 so far, than even in a bad influenza year. Pushaw also retweeted a Fox News story in which she insisted the new CDC schools guidance \u201cisn\u2019t based in science.\u201d Covid-19 cases are shooting up in almost every state, but Florida is seeing a stunning revival of the pandemic, accounting for nearly 1 in 4 of the new infections in the nation over the last week. DeSantis is now adopting a strategy that seems almost contradictory as he walks a political knife edge ahead of his reelection race next year: urging vaccines, unlike some other conservatives, but opposing most other kinds of countermeasures toward the disease. Florida Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist: Yes there should be mask mandates and lockdowns again DeSantis is a protege of Trump, though his rising political profile might soon get him crossways with the ex-President, who is mulling another White House run in 2024. In resisting CDC mask recommendations, DeSantis is following in well-trodden footsteps. Trump undermined masking guidelines right from the start in the knowledge that there was political advantage for him among base voters who believed him when he downplayed the pandemic. Most notoriously, Trump ripped off his mask in a self-aggrandizing photo op when returning to the White House after his bout with Covid-19 last year. While a masking showdown with Biden runs directly against the government\u2019s best health advice, it will likely do the Florida governor no harm as he continues to raise his political profile. A slump into an even deeper pandemic, however, could leave him more vulnerable ahead of his reelection race next year. Across the nation, the new CDC guidance on masking in schools is likely to mean a highly charged start to the new semester that begins within days in some states. In New Jersey, for example, some parents are going to court to try to prevent the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, from taking any steps to require masks in class.   \u201cWe live in a constitutional democracy. We do not have government by doctors meeting in conference rooms at CDC and issuing press releases,\u201d Bruce Afran, a lawyer for the parents, told CNN\u2019s Victor Blackwell on Tuesday. But the new political clashes over masking are dismaying doctors on the front lines of the pandemic, who are tired of people resisting health guidance. \u201cI am so sick of this virus filling my emergency department and those of my colleagues around the country. I am sick of watching sickness, severe illness and death,\u201d Brown University Professor of Emergency Medicine Megan Ranney told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. Ranney urged people to accept masking so that the country could get the Delta variant under control. Another physician, Dr. Jonathan Reiner \u2013 a professor of medicine at George Washington University \u2013 openly blamed people who are resisting vaccines for the CDC having to issue new guidance on masks. \u201cThe problem is that 80 million American adults have made a choice \u2026 not to get the vaccine, and these same people are not masking \u2013 and that is the force that is propagating the virus around the country,\u201d Reiner said on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d CNN\u2019s Rosa Flores and John Murgatroyd contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Maribeth Witzel-Behl had run elections in Madison, Wisconsin, for 15 years when the 2020 election arrived, bringing challenges like no other: a global pandemic, a crushing workload, lawsuits and a recount. Then the threats started. Wisconsin rules require the initials of the municipal clerk to appear on absentee ballots, but during a recount last November, people noticed her initials and seized on them as a sign that some kind of mischief must have occurred. An online discussion thread began weighing the weapons and ammunition to use against her, Witzel-Behl said. There was also discussion of lynching. So, when it came time to renew her employment contract, she struggled. \u201cEvery day for over a year, I just kept going back and forth,\u201d the 47-year-old said recently. \u201cIs it worth it? Is it time to do something else where there is less stress, more reasonable work hours and certainly no death threats?\u201d   Last month, Witzel-Behl decided to commit to another five years in her post. But her dilemma underscores the difficult choices election supervisors face as they increasingly become political targets in an era of widespread falsehoods about election fraud. Experts in the field fear a massive exodus of administrators that would change how elections are run \u2013 and threaten democracy itself. In all, more than 8,000 local officials oversee US elections, according to the Elections and Voting Information Center at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. There\u2019s no central tally of departures, but researchers see warning signs. Nearly 35% of local election officials, for instance, report they are eligible to retire before the next presidential election in 2024, according to a survey conducted in 2020 by the center at Reed College and The Democracy Fund. In the key battleground state of Pennsylvania, at least a third of election directors have resigned since fall 2019, said Lisa Schaefer, executive director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania. And nearly one in three local election officials included in a recent survey for the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice say they feel unsafe because of their jobs. (Last month, the US Justice Department announced a task force to address the rise in threats against election officials.) On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris is slated to meet with election officials and poll workers to hear their concerns and show solidarity with them, administration officials tell CNN. \u201cEverything I\u2019ve heard from state officials and from locals is how unbelievably stressful it is, that they just can\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d said Paul Gronke, who teaches political science at Reed and founded the voting information center. \u201cWe\u2019re in danger of losing a generation\u2019s worth of professional election expertise,\u201d added David Becker, who runs the nonprofit Center for Election Innovation and Research that works with election administrators. \u201cThat would be bad enough if it weren\u2019t also combined with the fact that they might be replaced with partisan hackery.\u201d In several key presidential battlegrounds, Republicans who share some of former President Donald Trump\u2019s views about election fraud now are running to oversee elections in their states. They include Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, who was one of 147 congressional Republicans who voted against certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s win even after a violent pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol.  He\u2019s hoping to oust Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in the Republican primary. Raffensperger resisted Trump\u2019s efforts to \u201cfind votes\u201d to overturn Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia. Election officials still reeling from the threats and attempts at intimidation during the 2020 election also face new penalties and curbs on their authority under laws advanced by Republican-controlled state legislatures this year. A measure sought by Republicans in the Texas House, for instance, would make it a felony for election officials to distribute unsolicited state ballot applications. And a far-reaching election law signed by Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in May imposes a fine of up to $25,000 on any supervisor who leaves a ballot drop box unattended. Wesley Wilcox, president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections representing the state\u2019s 67 county election administrators, said the new state law offers some valuable tools, such as a new load testing for online voting registration systems. (Last year, the state\u2019s online voter registration portal crashed on the final day of registration.) But Wilcox, who runs elections in Marion County, Florida, said the task of guarding ballot drop boxes will modestly increase his election costs. \u201cI\u2019m going to appoint two people at each early voting site to monitor the drop boxes, in case one of them has to go to the bathroom or something,\u201d said Wilcox, a Republican first elected in 2012. \u201cI\u2019ve got nine different sites. I can\u2019t be at nine different sites. I have to hire people to rely on to make sure I don\u2019t get fined.\u201d Other new laws ban private donations for election management. The nonprofit Center for Tech and Civic Life, fueled largely by contributions from Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and wife Priscilla Chan, distributed some $350 million Covid-response grants to nearly 2,500 local election agencies in 49 states. Conservatives argued it\u2019s inappropriate for outside organizations to subsidize a government function, and they have questioned whether the money disproportionately aided larger cities that tend to vote for Democrats as they move to ban the practice. In Madison, Witzel-Behl said a $1.2 million grant from the group offered a crucial lifeline, helping to underwrite additional pay for her overworked staff, along with funding other pandemic-related expenses such as drop boxes and postage. \u201cIt was the only way we were able to give our workers hazard pay,\u201d she said. (Witzel-Behl has no party affiliation; Wisconsin does not have partisan voter registration.) Witzel-Behl said she worried constantly about her staff and family last year. On police advice, she locked the office and screened visitors. At home, she kept the blinds closed and fretted about someone harming her teenage daughter. \u201cThat was the worst part of the whole thing \u2013 knowing it might have a negative effect on a member of my family,\u201d she said. The ugliness also took a personal toll on Seth Bluestein, chief deputy commissioner to Philadelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt. Bluestein helped supervise the counting of mail ballots in Philadelphia last November. In that role, he had become a target of threats and anti-Semitic messages, following disputes over how close partisan poll watchers could get to the city\u2019s election workers to observe the ballot-counting. \u201cYou will be hung in a court of law. You will not escape this treason,\u201d one female caller said in a voicemail message at the time that Bluestein recently shared with CNN. On Facebook, another person warned that \u201ceveryone with a gun is going to be at your house.\u201d He ended up with a security detail outside his home for just over a week during the height of the vote-counting. His 3-year-old daughter seemed to pick up on the extra stress and began to have nightmares, he said. \u201cYou never expect to deal with the kinds of things we dealt with in 2020,\u201d said Bluestein, 32. \u201cMy biggest concern now is the damage this is doing to our institutions and our democratic system.\u201d \u201cThe easiest thing anyone could do to restore confidence in our elections,\u201d he said, \u201cis to simply stop lying about the election being stolen because it\u2019s not true.\u201d Bluestein, who has worked on elections in Philadelphia since January 2012, is staying in his job but isn\u2019t sure what\u2019s next after Schmidt\u2019s term ends. Schmidt, the lone Republican on the city commission, already has announced he will not seek reelection in 2023. Bluestein is also a Republican. Back in Madison, Witzel-Behl said she decided to remain in her appointed post for another five years because it will give her the chance to continue to pursue a professional passion: easing inequities in voting across the city. Just last week, Witzel-Behl helped train a new crop of Wisconsin municipal election clerks. \u201cI kept telling them that they have to focus on why they are doing this work,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat it comes down to is making voting accessible to those who are eligible to vote. That\u2019s why we keep showing up day after day.\u201d CNN\u2019s Arlette Saenz and Jasmine Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Joe Manchin, a key vote in the effort to pass federal voting rights legislation, on Thursday said he and a group of Texas House Democrats, who have fled their state in an effort to block restrictive voting bills, have come to a \u201ctotal agreement\u201d on what they want, which is \u201cbasically to protect voting rights.\u201d Since arriving in Washington on Monday, Texas Democrats have sought meetings with members of Congress to urge them to pass federal voting rights legislation, including the For the People Act, the sweeping Democratic voting and election bill shot down by Senate Republicans last month. Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, has for weeks been at the center of the conversation on voting rights because of his opposition to eliminating the filibuster. Removing the legislative hurdle would allow Democrats to pass legislation with a simple majority. After meeting with members of the Texas delegation, Manchin said the next step is to put together a pared-down bill that focuses solely on protecting the right to vote and the procedure of voting. \u201cWe work with the Voting Rights Act that we had, started in 1965, and what we\u2019ve evolved into, and basically make a piece of legislation, one piece of legislation that protects the rights of voting, the procedure of voting, democracy, the guardrails on democracy, that\u2019s all. And there shouldn\u2019t be a Republican or Democrat should oppose it,\u201d Manchin said. Asked why he thinks Republicans would support a pared down bill, Manchin said: \u201cYou know why? Because they\u2019ve had a bill that\u2019s 800 pages long, they\u2019ve had everything thrown at them. Let\u2019s get back to the basic rights of voting, protecting voting rights.\u201d Texas state Rep. Joe Moody \u2013 one of the Democrats at the meeting in Washington \u2013 said the Texas delegation was pleased by its conversation with Manchin. \u201cSenator Manchin was very generous with his time, and Texas Democrats were heartened by our talks with him. We have no doubt that he completely shares our goal of protecting voting rights for all Americans, and we all realize that this is a struggle that won\u2019t be over in just a few days\u2014it\u2019s a journey, one we look forward to taking together,\u201d Moody said in a statement to CNN. However, back in Texas, House Speaker Dade Phelan on Thursday issued an order stripping Moody of his position as speaker pro tempore. The role of speaker pro tempore, largely a ceremonial role, is to carry out the Speaker\u2019s duties in their absence. Following his removal, Moody said on Twitter Thursday, \u201cThe most important titles in my life will never change: Dad, Husband, El Pasoan. Nothing political has ever even cracked the top three, so nothing has changed about who I am or what my values are.\u201d He added, in a separate statement to CNN, \u201cI followed my conscience knowing that doing the right thing could cost me, but not fighting would\u2019ve cost even more: the civil rights of Texans. The job I swore an oath to do is to defend our Constitution, so I\u2019d make that trade any day. Titles come and go, but my commitment to the people of El Paso and this state will always remain.\u201d Moody was appointed to the position by Phelan during this year\u2019s regular session. He also served as speaker pro tempore under a different Republican state House speaker in the 2019 session.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump kicked off his revenge tour against Republicans who defied him in the aftermath of the 2020 election on Saturday, using a sizable event here in Lorain County to lambast Ohio Rep. Anthony Gonzalez for voting to impeach him earlier this year. The effort to oust the Republicans who crossed him will be one of the biggest tests of Trump\u2019s post-presidential power, assessing whether he still has the sway with base Republican voters that he enjoyed during his four years in the White House. And on Saturday in Ohio, Trump looked to remind voters of Gonzalez\u2019s impeachment vote, and boost Max Miller, a former Trump aide who is challenging the congressman in the district\u2019s Republican primary next year. \u201cMax\u2019s opponent is a guy named Anthony Gonzalez, who\u2019s bad news. He\u2019s a grandstanding RINO, not respected in DC, who voted for the unhinged, unconstitutional illegal impeachment witch hunt,\u201d Trump said, mocking Gonzalez for, as he claimed, regularly calling the White House to fly on Air Force One when Trump would come to Ohio. \u201cHe\u2019s a sellout, he\u2019s a fake Republican, and a disgrace to your state, I will tell you that.\u201d Trump tried \u2013 without irony \u2013 to claim impeachment was \u201cnot the reason\u201d he made this his first campaign-style rally since the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, but much of his critique of Gonzalez focused on how the congressman was more in line with pro-impeachment Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney than Miller. Miller, who spoke before Trump, heralded the former President \u2013 \u201cLove that guy,\u201d he proclaimed \u2013 and argued that Gonzalez\u2019s vote is a \u201cbetrayal he can never turn back from and he should have to answer that day, after day, after day.\u201d And when Trump called him on stage, the Republican candidate said he had \u201cnever had a greater role model\u201d than Trump. \u201cPeriod,\u201d he said. \u201cBar none.\u201d While Trump cheered earlier this year as Republicans in the Ohio congressional district erupted in anger toward Gonzalez, time has helped the Republican congressman, with even his most ardent opponents admitting that the furor around his vote has since dissipated, as voters go about their daily lives and, in part, forget about the outrages of early 2021. 'You did the unthinkable': Ohio's Anthony Gonzalez faces fury over impeachment vote \u201cIf the election was (months ago), I do believe Gonzalez would have lost,\u201d said Jim Renacci, a longtime Ohio Republican who is mounting a primary challenge against incumbent Gov. Mike DeWine. \u201cIf the election was today, he is probably still in a danger zone\u2026 I think it would be a very tough race for him today, but he has got a year to prove himself out and voters do forget.\u201d But Trump\u2019s goal this weekend was to make sure voters don\u2019t forget, and much of the rally \u2013 from the other speakers to the former President himself \u2013 focused on his grievances with the 2020 election. Whether Trump\u2019s strategy works is an open question. Many of the voters at the Trump rally came to Wellington from hundreds of miles away to see Trump and knew nothing about the man the former President was targeting. And even among those voters from the district, few knew Miller beyond the campaign signs scattered around the Lorain County Fairgrounds. Some, like Carolyn Kovac, a 77-year-old from Jackson Township who backed Gonzalez in 2020, remained angry at him. \u201cHe turned on Trump, so he turned on me when he did that,\u201d she said. But most of the speakers on stage Saturday night didn\u2019t mention Miller or Gonzalez, instead focusing almost entirely on one man: Trump. Gonzalez has stood his ground throughout the political fracas, arguing that Trump\u2019s rhetoric ahead of the January 6 insurrection and the fact that Trump did little to stop those actions swayed him to back the impeachment charges. And he has doubled down: Much to the dismay of local Republicans, Gonzalez also voted to establish a bipartisan commission on the insurrection. In a statement to CNN about the Trump rally, Gonzalez\u2019s congressional campaign said the congressman was \u201cfocusing on issues that matter to the people of Northeast Ohio\u201d like \u201cstrengthening our economy, fighting back against the Chinese Communist Party and its unfair trade practices, serving our veterans and providing the highest level of constituent services.\u201d \u201cMax Miller isn\u2019t fit to represent our community in Congress, and the campaign, as it develops, will bear this out,\u201d the campaign said. The predicament the congressman, who initially made a name for himself as a standout wide receiver at Ohio State University and later in the NFL with the Indianapolis Colts, finds himself in highlights the broader divides inside the Republican Party, pitting the one-time Trump supporter whose support for the former President has waned against those who remain loyal to the Republican leader. Dave Handwerk, the mayor of Orrville, Ohio, a town in Gonzalez\u2019s district, has stood by his congressman in the face of withering criticism, arguing that the blowback his representative has received is a symbol of the \u201csad state of affairs\u201d inside the Republican Party. \u201cIf the Republican Party means you have to be a Trump supporter, I don\u2019t know what that means for me anymore,\u201d said Handwerk, a 68-year-old mayor who has been a Republican his whole life. \u201cFor me, it just means I don\u2019t know where the Republican Party is going anymore.\u201d Gonzalez has also responded to the blowback by raising questions about his own party and warning members about too much Trump loyalty. \u201cThe reality inside our party is people do feel differently about President Trump. If we are going to win elections going forward, retake the House, retake the Senate, retake the White House, there has to be room for both,\u201d he said in a May interview with The City Club of Cleveland. \u201cAnd if we are going to excommunicate people who feel differently\u2026I think it is a losing strategy for a party.\u201d In yet another sign that he is standing by his vote, Gonzalez recently started a joint fundraising committee with Cheney, another Trump target who lost her leadership role in the House because of her outspokenness on Trump\u2019s election lies. A Gonzalez aide said the committee was created because \u201csome donors wanted to write checks to both of them\u201d and the committee makes it easier to do that. But Gonzalez\u2019s warnings have largely fallen on deaf ears among Republican activists in his district, many of whom are hellbent on ousting Gonzalez. And his break with Trump earned him a serious primary challenge from Miller, who announced his campaign in February expressly because Gonzalez \u201cbetrayed\u201d his voters when he voted for impeachment. \u201cI won\u2019t back down. And I\u2019ll never betray them,\u201d Miller tweeted at the time. Trump quickly endorsed his former aide. Miller, despite being directly tied to Trump, has issues he will have to address during his campaign. Some Republicans, including another challenger to Gonzalez, have already noted Miller faced multiple criminal charges against him between 2007 and 2010. \u201cWe don\u2019t have room for error. So people\u2019s background and their character is important to voters,\u201d said Jonah Schulz, a Republican also challenging Gonzalez in the primary. Of Miller, he added, \u201cWe see this class of people in America\u2026 of individuals who play by a different set of rules and aren\u2019t accountable like the rest of us are.\u201d And Miller enters the primary with a money disadvantage \u2013 facing a Gonzalez war chest that is twice as large as his $438,554 in the bank. The gulf could be easy for Miller to make up. Trump signaled a willingness to help him raise money when he headlined a fundraiser for Miller in March. The two differing strategies are clear: As Miller runs toward Trump, Gonzalez has repeatedly painted a worrying portrait of a Republican Party strictly loyal to their former leader. \u201cAs a party, we need to be honest about where we are. And we are completely out of power at the federal government. We don\u2019t have the White House, we don\u2019t have the House, and we don\u2019t have the Senate. Sometimes when I hear us talk about the state of our party, we talk about how we somehow won an election. We lost all of them when you look at the federal government,\u201d Gonzales said in the interview with The City Club of Cleveland. \u201cMy concern is we are trying to excommunicate our own voters. And when you are fully out of power, you need to be adding voters, not subtracting voters.\u201d The anger directed at Gonzalez, even if it has diminished, continues to simmer with activists who helped get him elected. \u201cThe number of people contacting the party and saying this is awful, terrible, horrible, we got to get rid of him, has definitely decreased,\u201d said Doug Deeken, the chair of the Wayne County Republican Party. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think anyone has changed their mind about his vote.\u201d Lynn and Bruce Hjerpyn, two Trump supporters who live in Gonzalez\u2019s district, wrote their congressman two letters after his vote, fuming that he bucked Trump. \u201cHe betrayed us,\u201d said Lynn Hjerpyn, who attended Trump\u2019s rally in Washington, DC, on January 6, which helped fuel the insurrection that caused Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cWe have to be a party that does the right thing. That was my problem.\u201d And the problem for Gonzalez is that just as average Ohioans begin to forget about the vote, something happens to remind them. Most recently, that reminder came when the Ohio Republican Party\u2019s central committee censured Gonzalez in May for the vote, calling on the congressman they had endorsed just a few short months before to resign his post. Gonzalez\u2019s \u201cbet is simply to wait it out and hope that people forget and his belief all along was that people would turn on Trump and that he would be there,\u201d said Shannon Burns, a Republican activist who runs the Strongsville GOP, a grassroots organization that once backed Gonzalez. \u201cBut I think it is incumbent on all of us to inform the Republican voters of just who this person said he was and who he actually is.\u201d Burns, who pushed for the Ohio party to not only censure Gonzalez but to also call for his resignation, added: Trump \u201cbeing here will draw all of the attention necessary to those people who don\u2019t know that Anthony Gonzales voted to impeach. They are going to know after Saturday.\u201d Another issue for Gonzalez is just how politically active Ohio figures to be in 2022, with a competitive Senate race, a likely contentious Republican primary for governor and multiple closely watched House races. Nearly all Republicans in those races will likely use Gonzalez \u2013 and Trump\u2019s antipathy for him \u2013 as a way to win Trump\u2019s support. And in no race is that clearer than the Republican primary for Ohio\u2019s open Senate seat, where candidates hope to tie themselves as closely to Trump as possible. Josh Mandel, the former Ohio Treasurer; Jane Timken, the former chair of the Ohio Republican Party; and former Senate candidate Mike Gibbons all attended the Trump rally. Gibbons hosted a tailgate before the event, while Timken has a radio ad ahead of the event in which she says, \u201cno one is more committed to advancing his America First agenda than me.\u201d The group of Republican Senate hopefuls have all repeatedly slammed Gonzalez, too. Mandel called him a \u201ctraitor\u201d and while Timken was initially less hostile to him, she later said the impeachment that Gonzalez backed was a \u201csham.\u201d But arguably the biggest issue for Gonzalez could be redistricting. Ohio is set to lose a congressional seat because of relatively slow population growth. While new guidelines in the state will make the process more bipartisan, Republicans will have more control because they have dominated state politics for years and currently control all levels of state government. And Republicans in Northeast Ohio believe it is entirely possible that Gonzalez\u2019s district \u2013 which snakes from the suburbs of Cleveland on the shores of Lake Erie, down the Cuyahoga Valley into suburban communities like Strongsville and Medina and into more rural areas southwest of Akron like Wooster and Wayne County \u2013 could be eliminated entirely. \u201cThey are going to have to eliminate one district,\u201d said Renacci, who previously represented Gonzalez\u2019s district. The venue for Trump\u2019s event also hinted at this possibility. The former President rallied in Wellington \u2013 a town in Lorain County that is currently outside of Gonzalez\u2019s district. But some Ohio Republicans believe the new district could include more rural areas southwest of Cleveland. \u201cThe big question is what does the district look like because the only thing we know for sure is there aren\u2019t going to be sixteen districts in Ohio,\u201d said Deeken. \u201cUntil we know, we are just spitting in the wind here.\u201d This story has been updated with information from Trump\u2019s Saturday night rally.",

            "article_content": "Words can only describe so much from the nearly 500 criminal cases against rioters who overtook the US Capitol on January 6. Hours of media and live-streamed participant video have been available since that day, capturing crowds mounting scaffolding built for Inauguration Day, Trump supporters gleefully running through the building\u2019s hallways and the Senate chamber, and even the death of one participant shot by a police officer through a doorframe. But much of the most significant video capturing the most severe violent crimes from that day still can\u2019t be seen. That\u2019s because the Justice Department and the federal courts haven\u2019t proactively made available footage from surveillance cameras around the Capitol and from DC Metropolitan police officers\u2019 body cameras. Last week, the public finally began to see some of that video, because a group of 16 major media outlets led by CNN sued for access. The video releases \u2013 just a few in the media coalitions\u2019 continued pursuit of dozens \u2013 come as some Republicans, inspired by former President Donald Trump\u2019s election lies, are denying what happened on January 6, despite injured law enforcement officers like DC Police\u2019s Michael Fanone pushing for officials to acknowledge the Trump supporters\u2019 unlawful brutality that day. The effort to get footage released has taken months. In some cases, the videos became evidence in public portions of Capitol riot defendants\u2019 cases weeks ago. But it hasn\u2019t even been seen by reporters covering the court proceedings because of the peculiarities of video technology, the unprecedented sweep of the insurrection investigation and structural approaches in the federal court system. CNN\u2019s work to view video used in court began in March. Two months after the insurrection, federal defendants were appearing in court each day by the dozen. As defendants came through DC District Court following their arrests in their home states, judges held waves of hearings about whether to detain each of them. At those hearings, prosecutors needed to prove the alleged dangerousness of each defendant, showing how violent some were on January 6, especially toward police. The best way to do it, in many cases: Roll the January 6 tapes. The tapes showed from police officers\u2019 perspectives and unflinching surveillance cameras the violence of the pro-Trump crowd \u2013 law enforcement colleagues beaten and dragged and crushed in doorframes; police lines collapsing, completely overwhelmed. Typically the court press corps sits in the courthouse to watch hearings where these moments are laid out in excruciating detail. But because of coronavirus restrictions, we could only listen to DC federal court proceedings over the phone. The judges, lawyers and defendants, however, recreated their courtrooms over Zoom videoconferences. Another technological hitch kept these videos out of sight: While most evidence used in early federal criminal proceedings gets posted on an online public docket, called Pacer, that system can\u2019t house videos. As these limitations became more apparent every day, CNN and other news outlets started pushing for access. Thousands of hours of video became core to the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of the siege \u2013 an overwhelming trove of evidence that would be rolled out gradually to prove scene by scene the behavior of hundreds of rioters. In one case, against riot defendant Emanuel Jackson, NBC wrote to his judge and received limited access to a video from the case. In another, Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the court to post videos on its website from the case against the so-called \u201cQ Anon Shaman\u201d Jacob Chansley, who had become famous for posing with a horned headdress and a spear-tipped flagpole at the vice president\u2019s desk in the Senate. Then the Justice Department arrested two pro-Trump ralliers for spraying Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who later died, and two other officers with mace-like chemicals along the police line at the front of the Capitol building. It was a significant break in a major January 6 assault case. The West Virginia court where one defendant, George Tanios, first appeared allowed reporters to view his detention hearing as a livestream video. Prosecutors played videos of the Sicknick attack one after another, showing how each officer physically reacted to the assault. The judge in West Virginia, Michael Aloi, called the video of Sicknick \u201csurreal\u201d and noted how he was impacted by the severity of the chemical spray hitting the officers\u2019 faces. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me not to look at this as anything other than an assault on our nation\u2019s home, and everything that is important to us as a people,\u201d Aloi said at the hearing. Of the three defendants who had video from their court cases released several weeks ago, Tanios and Chansley are fighting their charges, while Jackson was just recently charged formally and is set to be arraigned in July. By March, I was cataloguing in a spreadsheet every time I or other CNN reporters and producers heard video played in DC District Court hearings. As a TV network, video is crucial to our storytelling. Crime and justice \u2013 even court itself \u2013 comes to life when video is added to our reporting toolbox. For every legal brief, judge\u2019s opinion or hearing we write about or discuss on air, seeing an assault or a victim\u2019s reaction replayed puts into focus the stories of these cases. By this spring, shaky livestreamed social media video and network TV wide shots of the Capitol set the scene, and Democrats at then-President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment trial used it to show the impact he had on his followers. But in covering the judicial response to the attack, we were still struggling to recreate the moments that the Justice Department has since found to be most the egregious, and to revisit them critically as rioters face charges. Take, for instance, an assault that has so far prompted DOJ to charge five rioters. The rioters allegedly took down three officers, stripping them of their gear, dragging them and beating them with crutches, flagpoles, batons and bare hands. Prosecutors have used the officers\u2019 body camera footage in court. \u201cEvery time I look at these videos, it just chokes me up,\u201d Judge Emmet Sullivan said during a hearing in the case, commenting on video the public and press corps has not seen. \u201cLet me stop for one second. It\u2019s shocking what these videos depict. It\u2019s shocking. That this is a battle scene at the United States Capitol, the heart of democracy in Washington, DC. I had to look at these a couple of times before it really sunk in what I was watching and it\u2019s hard to describe. It\u2019s hard to believe.\u201d Without being able to see the tapes, our reporting team cross-referenced dozens of pages of court records to understand the assault blow-by-blow, as judges and attorneys wrote to describe them, noting each defendant and officers\u2019 movements. At the same time, as we struggled to parse specifics of the most horrific assault cases from January 6, the nation was moved by an unrelated court proceeding that, ironically, rested upon the power of video: The death of George Floyd. The resonance of the video that bystander Darnella Frazier shot on her cell phone of Floyd\u2019s murder in Minneapolis last year, and the live footage from the trial of former Officer Derek Chauvin for Floyd\u2019s death, had sparked a national reckoning and amplified calls for an overhaul of policing in this country. \u201cVideo helps the American people trust that justice is being done,\u201d Gabe Roth, executive director of the court transparency advocacy group Fix the Court, told me recently. \u201cIf you see something, you\u2019re more likely to internalize it, more likely to understand it.\u201d \u201cThis is a major moment in American history that needs to be digested and seen and understood,\u201d he added, about January 6. \u201cIf you\u2019re piecing together the story of the day, you want to be able to have every angle.\u201d I repeatedly inquired with the court and the Justice Department about the Sicknick assault tapes and other videos shown in Capitol rioter hearings, and received assurances that the public evidence soon would become available \u2013 once a technological solution was found that could allow its distribution. A video portal never came. Instead, a debate over video in the Capitol riot cases emerged in court as cases progressed, with prosecutors first needing to share the evidence with rioters\u2019 defense teams. The Justice Department shared the view of the Capitol Police, whose top lawyer wrote in court early this spring that the public release of closed-circuit video around the Capitol could create a security risk. Neither seemed interested in a solution that could make video accessible to the public on the day it was newsworthy. The Justice Department, now led by former appellate Judge Merrick Garland, argued it believed video from early hearings, if distributed widely, could unfairly hurt Capitol riot defendants\u2019 access to fair trials \u2013 even if that video was used in open court and not protected by a judge\u2019s order to keep it under seal, meaning only accessible by the parties. Still, judges were deciding to release or detain defendants, often noting the horrifying violence toward police the video showed. Few still could see what they saw. The inability of the public to see the footage came as Republican lawmakers and Trump himself tried to sugar-coat the insurrection, attempting to tone down the violence, glorify the rioters as patriots and \u201ctourists,\u201d and falsely recast the attackers as attackees. Judge Paul Friedman pointed out the paradox at a hearing in late April. \u201cOne thing I will say about the videos is I wish that every member of Congress would be required to view them, because they\u2019re chilling,\u201d Friedman said. \u201cThey\u2019re really upsetting. And those who have views about what happened or didn\u2019t happen without hearing or seeing it with their own eyes it\u2019s \u2013 of course a lot of people who have views on what happened who  were actually there. But each person, each senator and each congressperson saw it, the events of the day from a different perspective and were not everywhere at every given moment, and they saw snapshots.\u201d Our efforts to see the video from court inched forward, and I worked with the DC District Court to be able to sit in on a few Capitol riot hearings \u2013 becoming the sole outside spectator witnessing those hearings in person in April. The prosecutors by then largely weren\u2019t playing video in court anymore. Instead, they were sending files directly to judges, then in court hearings simply spoke about what was on the tapes. At the hearings I attended, I could see the talking heads of lawyers on a video screen conversing with a judge physically present on the bench, and riot defendants piped into the courtroom by video from a camera at the DC Jail, an unusual approach for defendants precipitated by a need for pandemic distancing. After one proceeding \u2013 and my continued requests for access \u2013 the Justice Department in late April gave a thumb drive to the courthouse of body camera and Capitol surveillance video from the Sicknick assault and another case. I watched it in an empty courtroom with a court staffer, unable to show even the rest of my newsroom the footage of Sicknick struggling several minutes after the attack, or of another rioter picking a fight with police inside a Capitol hallway, then being thrown out the door. Drew Shenkman, a CNN lawyer who works on First Amendment projects especially out of Washington, realized our effort needed the help of courtroom lawyers from the firm Ballard Spahr, which often sues on behalf of media organizations seeking transparency and access. Shenkman and the outside legal team, led by attorney Charles Tobin, passed word of our effort to other media outlets as we sought the Sicknick videos. More than a dozen news organizations ultimately won wider access to the police body camera and surveillance video. That release came April 28, almost six weeks after the press corps first viewed it in court and I watched it semi-privately for a second time in April. That was just one case, among hundreds in the Capitol riot investigation. The media coalition then asked DC District Court Chief Judge Beryl Howell for broader accessibility. Though she sided generally with access to video, she determined each judge overseeing Capitol riot cases should make decisions separately on whether to release video shown in their courtrooms. That prompted all 16 media outlets to ask judges across the DC federal court this month for access to video in 17 cases. The news outlets that have banded together are: CNN, ABC News, NBC News, CBS News, NPR, the Associated Press, Buzzfeed News, Dow Jones and its newspaper the Wall Street Journal, Gannett, E.W. Scripps, the New York Times, Pro Publica, the Los Angeles Times, the Washington Post and the broadcasters Gray Media Group and Tegna. \u201cIn the face of growing denialism about January 6,\u201d Shenkman said this weekend, \u201cvideo is the undeniable record. The officer-worn body cameras are especially important. The assaults on officers that day were real and the videos, while tough to watch, show that the attacks were incredibly violent.\u201d Following the media coalitions\u2019 filings at the beginning of June, many judges have responded quickly. Three judges already ruled (in addition to the Sicknick assault video release), prompting the Justice Department to make public last week new video in the cases against Capitol riot defendants Patrick McCaughey III, Thomas Webster and Scott Fairlamb, all of whom are contesting their charges. The newly available footage shows the crowd in a tunnel into the Capitol pushing against screaming officers, Fairlamb taunting and shoving a MPD officer, and Webster wielding a pole then wrestling police. In just a few days, the release of the footage has renewed the conversation around the violence of Trump supporters toward police, who were attempting to keep order in the crowd and protect the Capitol. More than a dozen of the media coalition\u2019s video access requests still aren\u2019t decided, and the Justice Department in some has asked to block rebroadcasting of video, if it\u2019s released. In one case, a defendant who at the time was a former Trump State Department political appointee, seeks to keep private police body camera and surveillance footage used in his case. It allegedly shows the then-government official, Federico Klein, pushing a shield into an officer to break the police line and using the shield to wedge open doors to the Capitol. Klein claims the video\u2019s release at this time will destroy his ability to have a fair trial. He has pleaded not guilty. Another Capitol riot defendant seeks to make surveillance footage more accessible because he believes it\u2019s exculpatory. The Justice Department continues to arrest new defendants. And the media\u2019s push for access is far from over. Investigators still seek to identify more than 250 people they believe were violent or assaulted police on January 6, according to the DOJ about two weeks ago. None of the defendants have gone to trial yet. The trials will likely bring another set of courthouse moments where video becomes crucial to understanding the ferocity of the uprising.",

            "article_content": "Six men from California who allegedly organized themselves as a \u201cDC Brigade,\u201d including one man who spoke at a right-wing rally in Washington, DC, the day before the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, face new conspiracy charges from the Justice Department, according to court documents made public on Thursday. The case adds to a pile of prosecutions that investigators have pursued alleging that groups of American extremists from far-right organizations like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers worked together to plan the attack on Congress\u2019 certification of the presidential vote. This is the first case against multiple people said to be affiliated with the Three Percenters. The alleged Three Percenter conspirators are: Alan Hostetter, of San Clemente, Russell Taylor, of Ladera Ranch, Erik Scott Warner of Menifee, Felipe Antonio \u201cTony\u201d Martinez and Derek Kinnison, of Lake Elsinore, and Ronald Mele, of Temecula. Kinnison had written in an encrypted app the group used for planning that he, Martinez and Warner took part in the Three Percenters militia, which prosecutors say supported an armed revolution. Taylor, a speaker at a January 5 rally for then-President Donald Trump, is also accused of carrying a knife and telling the crowd during the January 6 siege to \u201cmove forward\u201d and head \u201cinside!\u201d In February, the FBI raided Hostetter\u2019s and Taylor\u2019s homes. Hostetter had founded the American Phoenix Project to oppose pandemic restrictions in 2020, and worked with Taylor and an unnamed person later in the year to claim the election had been stolen from Trump, according to the indictment Thursday. Hostetter and Taylor also co-sponsored the pro-Trump rally near the Supreme Court on January 5, one day before the attack, CNN previously reported. Footage of the rally shows the men spewing militant vitriol: Hostetter told the crowd to prepare for \u201cwar tomorrow\u201d against \u201cvipers\u201d in Congress who refused to nullify President Joe Biden\u2019s win. Taylor said, \u201cWe will not return to our peaceful way of life until this election is made right.\u201d Leading up to January 6, Hostetter and Taylor booked rooms at the Kimpton George Hotel and had a Telegram chat they named \u201cThe California Patriots-Answer the Call Jan 6.\u201d Another Telegram chat, used by all six defendants, said in its \u201cabout\u201d section that it would serve as the communications for \u201cable bodied individuals\u201d who on January 6 were \u201cwilling to fight,\u201d according to the indictment. Another of the indicted men, Ronald Mele, wrote on Facebook that he planned to bring \u201cgear,\u201d and he stayed at a Courtyard Marriott in Washington, DC, prosecutors said. Mele, Warner, Kinnison and Martinez planned a cross-country road trip to make it to the Trump rally, prosecutors said. The four also discussed using earpieces connected to radios and stashing guns in their SUV, the indictment said. CNN\u2019s requests for comment to Hostetter on Thursday went unanswered. Dyke Huish, an attorney for Taylor, told CNN his client has not been arrested and that Taylor plans to self-report to authorities on Friday. \u201cMr. Taylor intends to appear in court and intends to enter a not guilty plea,\u201d Huish said. \u201c(The indictment) came as a surprise to us.\u201d CNN\u2019s Paul Murphy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Thirty-five House Republicans chose the truth and American democracy over Donald Trump\u2019s personality cult. Now their Senate colleagues face the same battle of conscience over the effort to investigate the Capitol insurrection. The House of Representatives voted to establish an independent, bipartisan commission on Wednesday, but the bill still has a cliffhanger path ahead as supporters seek votes of 10 Republican senators needed to usher it into law. It remains an open, if perplexing, question if Republican senators will stand in the way of an investigation into an armed attack that sent them fleeing for safety. The revolt of 35 House Republicans against their leader, California Rep. Kevin McCarthy \u2013 who pushed strongly for the bill\u2019s defeat \u2013 represents the strongest rebuke yet of the former President from his own party ranks, far more than the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol mob scene. The surprising size of the Republican vote for the commission may indicate the politics of the issue are not yet set in stone and could give some Republicans pause as they consider their position on investigating the insurrection. \u201cPeople said we would not get more than 20 votes in the House from Republicans,\u201d said House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who negotiated the compromise bill with a GOP colleague. \u201cWe got 35, I am optimistic on the Senate side,\u201d Thompson said on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d John Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, wondered tentatively on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d whether the size of the GOP vote in favor of a commission was the \u201cbeginning of the breaking of the dam\u201d against Trump. \u201cIt is a big blow to the leadership that they lost these people and that\u2019s going to give momentum over in the Senate to see if they can find the 10 people to say they ought to get to the bottom of it,\u201d said Trump\u2019s former 2016 presidential primary opponent. It\u2019s worth remembering 35 Republican votes in favor of the commission represents a small fraction of the overall GOP caucus. A total of 175 Republicans voted against establishing the panel, the best hope of arriving at an established national set of facts about Trump\u2019s effective coup attempt against Congress. The sizable vote against a deal to establish the investigation, which drew concessions from Democrats and was negotiated by New York GOP Rep. John Katko, showed the still-vibrant power of Trump within the party. Late on Tuesday, Trump wondered in a statement whether McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell were \u201clistening\u201d to his bid to whitewash an egregious assault against US democracy. Within 24 hours, the ex-President had his answer. McCarthy was said by sources to be imposing intense pressure on his GOP members who were thinking about backing the bipartisan compromise. Even more significantly, McConnell \u2013 who had said he was open to hearing arguments for the commission \u2013 came out against it. His decision did not just show the power of Trump, but also just how much the party needs the base voters on whom the McConnell and McCarthy are relying in their quest to take back control the House and the Senate in the midterm elections next year. The fact there is not overwhelming support to investigate an incident in which a sitting President sent his mob to attack Congress to try to disrupt the transfer of power to his successor tells an eloquent story about the state of US politics. The move by McConnell, who fiercely condemned the Capitol insurrection but ultimately made the political calculation not to convict the ex-President at his impeachment trial, could be crucial. He, in effect, gave many of his Senate troops cover to vote against establishing the commission with his arguments that it had been over-politicized by House Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and that it would risk detracting from a large number of criminal prosecutors against January 6 rioters. The bill is in doubt because Republicans face the same political choices as they did when most of them wavered over holding Trump responsible in his second impeachment trial for the mob attack he incited. The sanctity of free elections and America\u2019s two-and-a-half century old experiment with democratic self-government is one thing. But any senator who wants a future in the party and the chance of enjoying life in a GOP majority after the midterm elections needs the ex-President\u2019s most committed voters. There are plenty of examples of what happens to Republicans willing to defy Trump. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who put the principle of peaceful transfers of power above her own career, lost her House leadership post. Republicans in the House and Senate who voted to impeach and convict Trump have been ostracized by colleagues, censured by local parties and are already staring down challenges from pro-Trump primary opponents. Apart from Trump\u2019s influence, there are several other reasons why Republican leaders are opposed to a formal commission like the one that investigated the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Any final report of the commission is likely to be highly critical of the ex-President\u2019s role in claiming the US election was stolen and then inciting furious supporters to march on the US Capitol as Congress was certifying his defeat. A panel armed with subpoena powers might also call key figures like McCarthy himself for high profile testimony under oath about his own involvement in the insurrection, including an angry phone call with Trump as it unfolded. That would be deeply embarrassing since McCarthy has hitched his party to Trump\u2019s still-burning political star as he tries to win the speaker\u2019s gavel next year. While it would also probe failings in the US Capitol Police and security around the Capitol, the commission might also be likely to note the role played by many members of Congress in fanning Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud. And it would be a massive public spectacle, with days of televised hearings and testimony likely to be damaging to Trump and his party. Republican leaders have also been remarkably open about other reasons for their reticence to vote for the commission: They want to crank up the pressure on President Joe Biden over his expansive liberal agenda and concentrate on their midterm message. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, has said he\u2019s fine with a commission, as long as it is set up in a way that cannot be weaponized politically by Democrats. But he also told CNN on Wednesday that he wanted to talk about \u201cthe kinds of things that the American people are dealing with: That\u2019s jobs and wages and the economy and national security, safe streets and strong borders \u2013 not relitigating the 2020 elections.\u201d \u201cA lot of our members, and I think this is true of a lot of House Republicans, want to be moving forward and not looking backward. Anything that gets us rehashing the 2020 elections I think is a day lost on being able to draw a contrast between us the Democrats\u2019 very radical left-wing agenda,\u201d he added. Any search for the 10 votes needed to enshrine the commission would likely start with the seven Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in February over the insurrection. Several of their number, like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, have long established themselves as enemies of Trump and probably have little left to lose politically from supporting a probe. Others, like Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, are retiring so may be less constrained by a midterm focus than some of their colleagues and have the luxury of not caring about future primary challenges. But a senator like Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2013 who surprisingly voted to convict the ex-President may now have reasons to keep his head down \u2013 has more difficult questions to answer as he mulls his vote. Another senator who voted to convict, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said on Wednesday that she felt Pelosi had politicized the commission and that she could not support it in its current form. And even if all the seven Republicans who voted to convict Trump over the Capitol insurrection stayed in line on the current matter, Democrats would still have to find three more Republicans to rebel against McConnell. The complicated mathematics suggests that the 35 votes of conscience in the House on Wednesday night may not be a harbinger of an even more significant revolt against the former President in the Senate.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats on Friday introduced a $1.9 billion spending bill to increase security at the US Capitol in response to the deadly January 6 attack by a violent pro-Trump mob seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election. The sweeping legislation, introduced by House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, a Democrat from Connecticut, covers a wide array of priorities, including providing funding to broadly enhance security across Capitol grounds as well as specific provisions to bolster protections and increase preparedness for lawmakers, including at their district offices, and the Capitol Police force. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said that Democrats plan to bring the legislation to a vote on the floor next week. \u201cIt\u2019s very essential that we get going with that. In my view, it\u2019s overdue. But nonetheless, it\u2019s urgently needed now,\u201d Pelosi said at her weekly news conference on Thursday. Democrats have pushed for security upgrades and a supplemental funding bill to address security at the Capitol in the wake of the January 6 attack incited by former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies that the election was stolen and calls for his supporters to fight back. Some Republicans have warned, however, against an overreach that they say would effectively create a locked down Capitol. The legislation would need to pass in the Senate as well as in the House before it could go to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk to be signed into law. House strikes deal to create independent January 6 commission \u201cThe January 6 insurrection caused tragic loss of life and many injuries, while leaving behind widespread physical damage to the Capitol Complex and emotional trauma for Members, Congressional employees, and the Capitol Police,\u201d DeLauro said in a statement announcing the release of the legislation. \u201cThis emergency supplemental appropriation addresses the direct costs of the insurrection and strengthens Capitol security for the future,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is also long overdue recognition of the work of the Capitol Police, the sacrifices that they and their families have made, and the changes they need.\u201d Among a number of provisions, the legislation would provide $250 million for Capitol grounds security, which could be used for physical infrastructure including \u201cretractable, or \u2018pop-in\u2019 fencing, and security sensors,\u201d according to a bill summary released by the House Appropriations Committee. There would be $162.7 million to harden security safeguards for windows and doors at the Capitol building as well as at House and Senate office buildings. The plan would have $7.4 million set aside to increase security for lawmakers, including threat assessments, and $10.6 million would go toward security measures and the installation of camera systems in district offices for members. The Capitol police force would be given $8.6 million for body cameras, $6.8 million for specialized training and $2.6 million \u201cto procure basic riot control equipment to outfit all officers with ballistic helmets, batons, and body shields,\u201d the bill summary states. The legislation would also set aside $200 million \u201cto create a dedicated Quick Reaction Force to augment the Capitol Police,\u201d according to the summary. Additionally, the security bill provides funding to help deal with the prosecution of individuals who took part in the January 6 attack. The bill summary says there would be $39.5 million \u201cto process the hundreds of prosecutions of perpetrators of the January 6 insurrection, including $34 million for United States Attorneys; $3.8 million for the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice; and $1.7 million for the National Security Division of the Department of Justice.\u201d",

            "article_content": "With its cultish devotion to Donald Trump, the majority of the Republican Party is choosing a wannabe-autocrat over the political system that made the United States the world\u2019s most powerful nation and its dominant democracy. The ex-President is showing that he doesn\u2019t have to be in the Oval Office to damage faith in US elections and to trash truth, as his movement based on lies and personal homage takes an increasingly firm grip of the Republican Party. The widespread mistrust he continues to foster in the fairness of the US political system among millions of voters poses grave risks to democracy itself. Trump, using his bond with the conservative grassroots, has effectively made fealty to his false claims of a fraudulent election last year the price of entry for any Republican candidate in any race. Under his influence, one of America\u2019s two great political parties has effectively shed its belief in democracy \u2013 a dereliction that is massively significant for the country\u2019s future. As he seeks personal revenge, Trump is also mobilizing to try to destroy the political viability of any GOP office holders who tell the truth about the Capitol insurrection he inspired like Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. He is celebrating the boos that Sen. Mitt Romney, a former Republican presidential nominee, received from activists in Utah over the weekend, after voting to convict Trump over his abuses of power in two separate impeachment trials. The former President retains an extraordinary ability to dictate the beliefs of his followers and the orthodoxy of the GOP on a daily basis. \u201cThe Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020 will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!\u201d Trump decreed in a statement Monday, literally reversing the facts about last November\u2019s free and fair election that he lost. Cheney may well be sacrificing her own political career as one of the few GOP lawmakers with the guts to speak truth about Trump\u2019s anti-democratic attacks. A new effort is underway among the ex-President\u2019s acolytes in Congress to strip her of her No. 3 position in the House only three months after she comfortably retained it in a secret ballot election. Cheney\u2019s ability to fight off a pro-Trump primary opponent in her home state of Wyoming is questionable. Her transgression is to simply keep pointing out the truth: that last year\u2019s election wasn\u2019t stolen by President Joe Biden. CNN reported Monday that Cheney said at a behind-closed-doors conference in Georgia that Trump\u2019s behavior was a \u201cpoison in the bloodstream of our democracy.\u201d She added: \u201cWe can\u2019t whitewash what happened on January 6 or perpetuate Trump\u2019s big lie. It is a threat to democracy. What he did on January 6 is a line that cannot be crossed.\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, on Tuesday appeared to open the way for a new vote on Cheney\u2019s leadership position, saying that she was no longer capable of representing the party\u2019s strategy in the run-up to the midterm elections. That strategy, of course, is closely aligned with Trump\u2019s. \u201cI have heard from members, concerned about her ability to carry out the job as conference chair, to carry out the message,\u201d McCarthy said on Fox News. Trump is answering one question that was often asked in his dark last days in office \u2013 would he be as powerful in private life as he was with the trappings of presidential office? If anything the former President wields even more control of his party now than he did over the last five years , a fact made more remarkable by the social media silence enforced by bans from major social media platforms. And there are very clear signs that Trump\u2019s assault on American democracy is working. In a CNN poll released last week, only 23% of Republican voters believed that Biden legitimately won sufficient votes to win the election last year. This follows a Quinnipiac poll in February that showed that 76% of Republicans believe that there was widespread fraud in the election. Court after court threw out Trump\u2019s spurious claims of election fraud after his defeat to Biden. There is no evidence that he was unfairly deprived of office. In fact, the only person who tried to steal the election was Trump, with his bid to disrupt Congress certifying the results by inciting a crowd of supporters that mobbed the Capitol, sending lawmakers fleeing. Trump\u2019s manufactured crisis of legitimacy will effectively taint the midterm polls in 2022, which the former President is trying to use to tighten his stamp on the party. And even if Trump doesn\u2019t try to reclaim the White House in 2024, his pernicious influence will mean that the idea that the last election was stolen will remain a false article of faith for Republicans going forward. A flurry of recent developments prove Trump\u2019s power in the GOP and his undiminished threat to trust in the electoral system, and show that the fight for American democracy merely entered a new phase when he left office. A slew of Republican state legislatures have passed laws making it more difficult for Democrats, and especially Black voters, to cast ballots. They often cite voter mistrust in the electoral system as a rationale for those changes. But the chief cause of that mistrust is the relentless campaign by Trump to discredit the election he lost, both before and after voters went to the polls. In another sign of Trump\u2019s malign influence, the state Senate in Arizona is conducting a sham recount of votes in crucial Maricopa County that helped Biden win the state, despite repeated statements and rulings by electoral officials and courts that the President\u2019s narrow victory was genuine. Republican officials who once had the courage to condemn Trump\u2019s insurrectionist rhetoric are now seeking to ingratiate themselves with his supporters \u2013 especially those who may run for President in future, including former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. McCarthy, who at first said Trump bore responsibility for the January 6 riot, quickly visited the former President at his Mar-a-Lago resort and is anchoring his effort to win back the House for Republicans next year on the former President and his movement. Any idea that the GOP will shed its fealty to Trump was exposed as a pipe dream by the poor showing of Marine veteran Michael Wood, who ran in a special election for a House seat in Texas at the weekend on an anti-Trump platform and lost badly in a jungle primary with only 3% or the vote. \u201cThere is a sickness in our party that must be acknowledged and addressed,\u201d Wood wrote in a message to voters after his defeat. \u201cWe are too much a cult of personality and a vehicle for the grievances of Donald Trump. We are too comfortable with conspiracy theories.\u201d The former President sent out a statement claiming credit for the showing of Susan Wright, the wife of Rep. Ron Wright who died from Covid-19, after she moved into a run-off for the seat following the ex-President\u2019s endorsement. The secret of Trump\u2019s appeal from the start of his presidential campaign in 2015 was that he channeled the distrust many conservatives felt towards the Washington establishment and the political system itself. He gave people a kind of permission to believe in what they felt viscerally rather than facts and truth. His attempt to destroy trust in the electoral system is creating another false reality with a built-in belief system that is deeply attractive to his voters. The fact that none of it is true does not detract from the power of his appeal. But it is still extraordinary that the Republican Party, which in recent memory styled itself as the guardian of democracy and boasted about winning the Cold War against tyranny, could transform in this manner. \u201cIt is just mind boggling to me that Republicans could be this way,\u201d said Dave Millage, who was forced to resign his post as chair of the Scott County, Iowa, Republican Party after backing Trump\u2019s impeachment over the Capitol insurrection. Millage slammed his fellow Republicans for \u201cworshipping at the altar of Trump\u201d during an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom\u201d on Monday. \u201cHe was attacking American democracy itself. Yet they are standing by him. It just astounds me.\u201d The electoral impact of Trump\u2019s dominance over his party will be tested next year as Republicans have a historically good chance of overhauling the thin Democratic majority in the House, since new Presidents often get a rebuke. Since most mid-terms, especially House races, are heavily influenced by base turnout, the GOP may profit from Trump\u2019s continuing ability to inspire the party\u2019s most loyal voters. But it is less clear that a slate of pro-Trump, Capitol insurrection denialists will help Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s bid to reclaim control of the Senate \u2013 or that this message carried by Trump or anyone else is a winning one in 2024. After all, the former President managed to lose control of the House, the Senate and the White House with an approach that electrified the GOP base but alienated many suburban voters and those horrified with his handling of the pandemic. Former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who paid with his political career for being an early critic of Trump\u2019s presidency, warned that his party was making a huge mistake by not shaping a more compelling appeal to a wider group of voters. \u201cWith the Democratic Party moving more progressive, there is plenty of room there,\u201d Flake told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto on Monday. \u201cAnd we could do well in the midterms but not if we continue this craziness of questioning the last election and going after those who aren\u2019t completely devoted to the former President.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A special election in Texas on Saturday features a sprawling field of Republicans and Democrats competing for the US House seat formerly held by the late GOP Rep. Ron Wright, who died in February after contracting Covid-19. Candidates from both parties are competing on the same ballot, with 23 candidates in total, including 11 Republicans and 10 Democrats. If no candidate wins more than 50% of the vote on Saturday, the race will advance to a runoff between the two candidates who receive the most votes. Texas\u2019 6th Congressional District has been in Republican hands for years, though the GOP margin of victory has declined at the presidential level in recent elections. That creates a possible opening for Democrats, but a Republican candidate is still viewed as most likely to win. \u201cI think Democrats can compete in this district, but it is still right of center, and one would expect the Republicans to hold it,\u201d Kyle Kondik, an election analyst at the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, told CNN. \u201cAlso, and just like in midterms, special elections are likelier to break against the White House party than toward it. If Trump was still in the White House, this race might very well be a coin flip, but it\u2019s not one would expect to flip with a Democratic president in office.\u201d Among the Republican field, Susan Wright, the widow of the late congressman, is frequently described as the front-runner, and her campaign got a major boost with a recent endorsement from former President Donald Trump. In a shocking last-minute development in the race, Wright\u2019s campaign said Friday that it has reached out to federal law enforcement authorities after learning of a robocall falsely alleging that she had murdered her husband. \u201cThis is illegal, immoral, and wrong,\u201d Wright said in a statement. \u201cThere\u2019s not a sewer too deep that some politicians won\u2019t plumb. Imagine it: someone is attacking my late husband, the love of my life, a man who gave me such joy in life.\u201d Other leading GOP contenders include state Rep. Jake Ellzey, a top fundraiser in the race, and Brian Harrison, a former Trump administration official who worked for the Department of Health and Human Services. Almost all of the Republican candidates have tied themselves to Trump to varying degrees, including Dan Rodimer, a former pro wrestler running on the tagline \u201cMake America Texas again,\u201d and Sery Kim, another former Trump administration official, who served as an assistant administrator at the Small Business Administration. \u201cPresident Trump is still the leader of the Republican Party,\u201d Rodimer told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to go anywhere, ever. I hope he doesn\u2019t.\u201d The exception in the GOP field is Michael Wood, a Marine combat veteran and the one Republican in the race who has run an explicitly anti-Trump campaign. Wood wants Republicans to reject Trump and stop perpetuating conspiracy theories like the lie that the 2020 election was stolen and like QAnon, which is frequently described as a virtual cult. \u201cI felt like I had to stand up. Somebody needed to stand up and say this isn\u2019t what the Republican Party should be, and we\u2019ve got to go in a different direction,\u201d Wood told CNN. Kinzinger is on a mission to save the Republican Party. The question is whether the party wants saving Wood is widely viewed as running a long-shot campaign, but he has the endorsement of GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and the race will be a high-profile test of whether an anti-Trump message can resonate with conservative voters in the aftermath of the January 6 US Capitol attack and Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. On the Democratic side of the field, three candidates appear to be most competitive: Jana Lynne Sanchez, who was the Democratic candidate for the seat in 2018; Lydia Bean, who ran for a state House seat in 202; and Shawn Lassiter, an educator and nonprofit leader. Several of the Democrats in the race have taken aim at Washington politicians, including Texas\u2019 GOP Sen. Ted Cruz, zeroing in on his controversial decision to fly to Cancun, Mexico, in February as a weather disaster in his home state left millions without power or water, a move he has said was \u201cobviously a mistake\u201d and that \u201cin hindsight I wouldn\u2019t have done.\u201d In one campaign video, Sanchez says, \u201cToo many working Texans are struggling, but Washington politicians like Ted Cruz opposed $1,400 checks for us. They even abandoned us when the lights went out.\u201d Lassiter says in one of her campaign videos, \u201cTexas families are angry, tired and we want answers \u2026 Families who had power were bringing in strangers during a pandemic, but our senator leaves for a beach vacation. It should be instinct for our leaders to care, to fight.\u201d CNN\u2019s Donie O\u2019Sullivan, Manu Raju, Alex Rogers, Ethan Cohen, Adam Levy and Paul P. Murphy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Most Mondays and Tuesdays, former President Donald Trump skips golf to confer with aides about the week ahead. Together they decide which Republican candidates he will meet with at his office \u2013 a converted bridal suite above Mar-a-Lago\u2019s 20,000-square-foot ballroom \u2013 and whether they deserve his support. Often, he\u2019ll ask for updates on his leadership PAC and political operation, or spend hours chatting by phone with a coterie of old friends. Far from a conventional post-White House retirement, Trump\u2019s first 100 days out of office illustrate a man who has preferred plotting the next chapter of his political career to planning his presidential library, recruiting MAGA-aligned Republican primary challengers to writing a post-presidential memoir. Whereas his predecessors disengaged from politics for months after leaving office, Trump has turned the same political warfare that defined his presidency into a full-time retirement hobby as he weighs a full return to the spotlight with a potential comeback presidential bid in 2024. \u201cHe didn\u2019t play by the rules as President and he\u2019s certainly not going to as an ex-President,\u201d Newsmax CEO and longtime Trump pal Chris Ruddy said. More than a dozen Trump aides, confidants and allies who spoke with CNN \u2013 many of whom were granted anonymity to candidly discuss his post-presidency \u2013 say the former President, who remains bitter about his defeat in the 2020 election, has nevertheless come to enjoy his status as a GOP kingmaker, relishing his ability to disrupt races or elevate pro-Trump figures against dissenters inside the party. Others noted that he is yearning to return to the White House and claimed that his efforts to build a post-presidential political machine are principally aimed at supporting that goal. Most days of the week, Trump begins with 9 a.m. tee times at his namesake golf course 15 minutes from his home. He usually plays 18 holes, but he sometimes stays for the course\u2019s full 27, followed by a leisurely lunch at its clubhouse with a rotating cast of friends. These days, friends say, he avoids the buffet. Trump then conducts candidate interviews or meetings with his staff back at his oceanfront resort until 7:30 p.m. before joining his wife, Melania, for dinner on Mar-a-Lago\u2019s bustling terrace. In recent weeks, the couple has dined with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his wife, Callista, who served as US ambassador to the Holy See during the Trump administration, and former White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who remains a close friend. \u201cRight now, he\u2019s doing a very good job sustaining his movement in case he does decide to run,\u201d Gingrich said. It took Trump several weeks to get settled into his post-White House life. Because he had refused to accept his loss to President Joe Biden, who emerged from the November election with a 306-to-232 victory in the Electoral College, few preparations had been made to prime the luxury South Florida resort for his arrival. For their first few weeks on the job, a small team of aides paid by the General Services Administration to oversee his transition operated out of a villa on resort grounds with no office phones, computers or desks. Formally, Trump was allowed to select the modest team, whose salaries are customarily paid for by the GSA in accordance with the Former Presidents Act. But almost immediately, an assortment of other advisers were invited by Trump to oversee construction of his new political operation \u2013 one he hoped would guard his rank as de facto leader of the Republican Party and lend support to allies in local, state and federal races who could advance his agenda. Among them were Trump campaign lawyer Justin Clark and attorney Alex Cannon, former Trump campaign managers Bill Stepien and Brad Parscale, senior adviser Jason Miller, former White House social media director Dan Scavino and longtime allies Corey Lewandowski and Dave Bossie. While the hangers-on from Trump\u2019s reelection campaign began to fine-tune his post-White House apparatus \u2013 including Save America, a cash-flush leadership PAC created last year that has allowed him to back candidates for public office, and a separate super PAC led by Lewandowski \u2013 the ex-President resumed outreach to others in his orbit. Donald Trump: America's 45th President People familiar with these interactions said Trump has regularly called Conway, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Rand Paul of Kentucky, and Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio for messaging and political advice or to complain about Biden and Democratic leaders. And when outside advisers started warning him in March that his post-presidential operation \u2013 particularly his methods for vetting candidate endorsements \u2013 appeared disorganized, Trump hauled in another longtime ally, Florida-based GOP strategist Susie Wiles, to instill order. A person close to Trump who fielded multiple disgruntled calls from the former President in his first few weeks out of office said it took him several weeks to overcome the isolation he felt after hundreds of his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6 and he was thrust into a political exile. After he arrived at Mar-a-Lago following a low-key sendoff at Joint Base Andrews the morning of Biden\u2019s inauguration, this person said Trump would talk about forming a third party and complain that Republicans, like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California, couldn\u2019t wait to get rid of him \u2013 noting that his focus was on the past, not the future, which contributed to the early chaos in his post-presidential operation. \u201cMost people would leave the White House relieved to have the weight of the world lifted off their shoulders, but for him it was a reality that took some time to get used to. Those first few weeks, it was not an easy transition,\u201d said the person close to Trump. By mid-February, Trump \u2013 convinced by aides and Republican party leaders that 2022 should be his immediate focus and still interested in exacting revenge against GOP incumbents who had voted to impeach him or dismissed his election fraud charade \u2013 began discussing candidate endorsements with his team. The former President already had a laundry list of prospective primary challengers lined up to take on his foes inside the party. But privately, he was working the phones to recruit more. In Georgia, he encouraged GOP Rep. Jody Hice to launch a bid to unseat Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who repeatedly rejected Trump\u2019s baseless claims of rampant voter fraud in the state and is currently cooperating with state investigators as they investigate a January 2 phone call in which then-President Trump asked Raffensberger to find the votes needed to flip the state into his column. In Ohio, where Trump has yet to bestow his blessing on one of the several Republican candidates running to fill outgoing GOP Sen. Rob Portman\u2019s seat, the former President reportedly grilled four of the contenders at his Palm Beach golf club before a fundraiser last month. Aides say Trump is still on the hunt for a primary recruit in Georgia\u2019s 2022 gubernatorial race due to his dissatisfaction with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s handling of the 2020 results in his state. They note he is also vetting challengers to Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the only Senate Republican facing reelection next fall who voted to convict him after his second impeachment trial earlier this year. He has plans to target the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach him and are hoping to hang on to their seats in the upcoming midterm elections, as well. Occasionally, the 45th President has invited candidates to meet with him at Mar-a-Lago who he has no intention of endorsing. One Trump aide said he enjoys the lavish praise and frequently crows to guests at the club about the weight his support carries. He has similarly hosted incumbent Republicans who have echoed his false claims about the January 6 insurrection and are already widely expected to receive his endorsement. Last week, for instance, Trump met with Rep. Claudia Tenney, a New York Republican who has falsely asserted that many of the insurrectionists who ransacked the halls of Congress \u201cprobably weren\u2019t ever Trump people.\u201d Next month, these proverbial pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago will end as Trump escapes the hot Florida summer to relocate to his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. The move has frustrated some allies who view his Florida resort as an ideal access point to wealthy Republican donors in the area \u2013 including former Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who former Trump aides starting their own political outfits have solicited for financial support \u2013 and who are wary of the old friends Trump will encounter during his stay up North. \u201cA lot of his aides and allies thought Florida was going to be the center of the Earth for the next two years, and now he\u2019s up and out of there,\u201d said a former senior administration official. \u201cHis Bedminster club is much more closely knit, and you really never know who\u2019s going to show up.\u201d People familiar with his plans said Trump will continue to host meetings at Bedminster, where he conducted many of his interviews for Cabinet posts during the 2016 presidential transition and where the conference rooms and office space may create an environment that is more conducive to his post-presidential planning. The New Jersey venue will also serve as the backdrop for lengthy interviews of which Trump is the subject, as he continues meeting with journalists who are penning books about his presidency and already completed first-round interviews at Mar-a-Lago. \u201cOur expectation is that the fundraisers and meetings will continue undisrupted. He\u2019ll probably want to host people in his living room at the cottage in Bedminster,\u201d said one person close to Trump\u2019s operation. Some Trump allies are hoping this summer will provide clarity about the former President\u2019s 2024 ambitions and his plans to assist candidates he\u2019s already endorsed, or who he plans to, ahead of the midterm elections in November 2022. Trump has played coy about his desire to seek a second term \u2013 declining to either rule out a bid or commit to running \u2013 while promoting Republicans who are widely seen as strong contenders themselves for the party\u2019s nomination. In a March 22 appearance on \u201cThe Truth with Lisa Boothe,\u201d Trump said the GOP has \u201ca pretty deep bench\u201d of possible contenders and went so far as to name-check Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. His noncommittal posturing has frustrated some allies, who worry he is blowing an opportunity to take control of the GOP early on and opening the door for other presidential hopefuls to forge relationships with his supporters. \u201cIt\u2019s important to have a field-clearing exercise sooner rather than later if he\u2019s going to run, otherwise some of these other guys are going to start getting momentum,\u201d said the former senior administration official. Indeed, some rumored 2024 contenders have been laying the groundwork for their own potential campaigns with appearances in states that will play a critical role in the Republican presidential primary and general election: Former Vice President Mike Pence will deliver his first public address since leaving office in South Carolina this week. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who visited Iowa in March, also appeared virtually at a fundraiser last month for New Hampshire Republicans. And both DeSantis and former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley are due for appearances in Pennsylvania and Iowa, respectively, in the next two months. Sens. Rick Scott of Florida, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Tim Scott of South Carolina have also made recent stops in Iowa \u2013 or plan to in coming months \u2013 fueling speculation about their presidential ambitions. Other Trump allies have urged him to fine-tune his post-presidential messaging, which has featured ruthless attacks against Republican Party leaders and incumbent GOP officeholders and only recently drifted into regular criticism of the Biden administration. They say the vengeance-driven strategy he has deployed so far is unlikely to be helpful in the long term and ignores what they view as layup opportunities to target Biden and Democratic leaders over issues like immigration, taxes and identity politics. \u201cI think the radicalism of the Democrats is going to rebound enormously to Trump\u2019s benefit and he would be better off to focus on the Democrats. He has enough friends to go after disloyal Republicans,\u201d said Gingrich. \u201cHe should take the higher position and focus on larger domestic issues and international crises,\u201d added Newsmax CEO Ruddy. While aides say Trump has recently been paying more attention to Biden\u2019s agenda and policy decisions \u2013 last week he issued a statement criticizing Biden\u2019s timeline for withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan and told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity that the surge of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border could \u201cdestroy our country\u201d \u2013 the former President\u2019s focus remains primarily on himself. \u201cHe hates being off the A block,\u201d said a person close to Trump, using a term that refers to the lead segment in a cable news program. \u201cHe\u2019s really thinking of running again in 2024 just to get back to that.\u201d The person close to Trump\u2019s operation said that while his TV consumption has declined since he left office \u2013 a byproduct of him no longer being surrounded by televisions in the Oval Office or aboard Air Force One \u2013 he still reads The New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post each morning and regularly marks up articles about his achievements or policies to send to aides and advisers. And when an unflattering story pops up, he is quick to pick up the phone to complain to friends. \u201cHe\u2019ll usually call when there are some bad polls saying something about him or that he feels are out of whack,\u201d Trump pollster John McLaughlin said. Recently, Trump has initiated discussions about resuming the signature MAGA rallies that fortified his nascent political movement in 2016 and continued throughout his presidency. While he has vowed to travel to Alaska to campaign against Murkowski and is said to be interested in hosting campaign events for some of the candidates he\u2019s already endorsed, aides said the logistics are still being worked out but that he could resume rallies as early as May. \u201cIt will definitely be different in terms of the setup, but we got really good at planning these events in 2020, so we will probably use a lot of those same vendors again,\u201d said the person close to Trump\u2019s post-White House operation. While Trump\u2019s life has changed dramatically since he left Washington three months ago to pursue the next phase of his political career, so too has his family\u2019s. Most of his adult children, as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, have taken a break from the spotlight to provide private counsel to their father or focus on their own families. Several Trump aides who have spent the past few months shuttling between Washington and Mar-a-Lago said Ivanka Trump and Kushner, who purchased a $30 million waterfront lot in Miami shortly before leaving the White House, are the most withdrawn. Once a prolific over-sharer on social media, with frequent video posts about everything from the child tax credit to workforce campaigns and hundreds of photographs of herself, Ivanka Trump, like her dad, has spent the past 100 days in relative online silence. Kushner, meanwhile, has popped in and out of his father-in-law\u2019s orbit as he devotes much of his time to writing a book about his tenure inside the West Wing and preserving the Middle East peace treaties he helped negotiate during the Trump presidency. \u201cShe wants to spend as much time as she can with her family after a few very busy years,\u201d said a person familiar with Ivanka\u2019s new life in Miami, adding that Trump\u2019s elder daughter continues to be a \u201chands-on mom.\u201d Likewise for Trump\u2019s wife and former first lady, Melania Trump, whose life outside the East Wing has changed both very much and not at all. People familiar with her activities say she continues to do what she wants when she wants and is not beholden to the norms of conventional post-first lady duties in the same way she conformed to traditions while her husband was in office. Though she established her own official office with at least three staffers, the most that has come out of it appears to be a stylized logo reminiscent of a presidential seal. She has not made any official appearances since leaving Washington, nor has she announced plans for a memoir \u2013 a popular post-White House activity for former first ladies. \u201cShe\u2019s not a presence at Mar-a-Lago at all. She\u2019s not mingling with people and rarely interacts with her husband\u2019s staff,\u201d said a person close to the couple. What has primarily changed for her, 100 days out, is her environment. Far from the sprawling White House complex, she and Trump share a large suite of rooms at the 17-acre Mar-a-Lago property, though she maintains her own personal office. She makes frequent trips to the on-site spa \u2013 with one person telling CNN she sometimes goes for treatments twice a day \u2013 and spends her afternoons with the couple\u2019s son, Barron, now 15. Three people familiar with Trump\u2019s dinnertime appearances say she appears \u201chappy and relaxed\u201d when they have seen her, and that she smiles and gives a wave as other dinner patrons rise from their seats to applaud the arrival of the former first couple to the dining area. She likes the Dover sole and a Diet Coke with no ice, and two of the people note she is often joined by her parents, Viktor and Amalija Knavs, who spend weeks at a time at the South Florida club in their own personal suite, which functions as their seasonal home. The only Trump relative whose involvement in politics has seemingly increased since the former President left office is that of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who recently closed on a home in Jupiter, Florida, with his girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, and has become a trusted adviser to his father on political strategy and candidate endorsements. Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle purchased the 11,000-square-foot home in the Admiral\u2019s Cove development for $9.7 million and are expected to move in shortly, according to a source. Trump\u2019s ex-wife, Vanessa Trump, spends a substantial part of the year with the couple\u2019s five children in Jupiter, which also happens to be a 40-minute drive from Mar-a-Lago. It is unclear if Trump Jr., who recently returned from a hunting trip in Alaska, will become a regular presence at his father\u2019s Bedminster golf club once the former President relocates for the summer. So far, he has stayed in touch with his father mostly by phone, with occasional appearances at his resort in Palm Beach. CNN\u2019s Kate Bennett contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Real hope for police reform \u2013 even in the rancorously divided US Senate \u2013 shows the seismic impact of the guilty verdict in the trial for George Floyd\u2019s murder. A day after former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted on all counts, both sides in Washington sought common ground. The Senate\u2019s lead Republican negotiator, South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott, put forward a potential deal on a sticking point that has stalled talks for the much of the past year. But hope goes only so far, and the feverish desire among Democratic activists to honor Floyd\u2019s life by passing federal legislation that would hold police accountable for brutality and misconduct is colliding with the realities of a polarized capital. While many Americans \u2013 including some Republicans \u2013 may approve of the verdict in the Chauvin case, Republicans and Democrats are still struggling to reconcile perspectives on how to make rogue officers accountable for their conduct, creating serious challenges for the proposed legislation. There is also a broader threat hanging over the compromise efforts: the bitter political forces rocking the country in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, which could crush the already limited space for bipartisan action. Republicans eying the midterm elections \u2013 and, in some cases, future presidential primary races \u2013 have a strong incentive to appeal to grassroots voters by adopting a hardline posture on law and order and to demonize Democrats as radicals who want to defund the police. Some Republicans may also argue that since justice was achieved in the Floyd case, claims of systemic racism in law enforcement are exaggerated and therefore no action is necessary. This talking point is already emerging on Fox News. In this brief moment of comity, it is also easy to forget that the GOP\u2019s effort to portray Democrats as a threat to law enforcement \u2013 largely by inaccurately suggesting they all supported the radical calls to \u201cdefund the police\u201d \u2013 was one of their most potent weapons in the 2020 elections and is likely to remain so as they enter the midterm races in 2022. Even President Joe Biden, who plans to advocate for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act during his address to a joint session of Congress next Wednesday, acknowledged the political perils for Democrats on policing during a private virtual meeting with civil rights leaders in December. On the recording, which was obtained by The Intercept, Biden told the activists that Republicans \u201cbeat the living hell out of us across the country\u201d in 2020 by arguing the party would \u201cdefund the police.\u201d After four years in which Trump and his allies made inroads with the working-class union families who are typically supportive of police, Democrats in swing states may be skittish about leaning too far into criminal justice reform. It also remains unclear whether Republicans have any real political incentive to support police reform legislation as they look ahead to next year\u2019s elections. Last July, 58% of Americans said major changes were needed within policing in America, according to a Gallup poll, but only 14% of Republicans agreed with that statement, while 72% of GOP respondents said \u201cminor changes\u201d were needed. Several Republican strategists cautioned Wednesday that dissatisfaction with police \u2013 and disgust with Chauvin\u2019s diabolical acts during his encounter with Floyd last May \u2013 should not be mistaken for a groundswell of support for dramatic changes to the laws governing policing in this country within the GOP base. Support for the Chauvin verdict, veteran Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said, \u201cdoes not mean that there is support for a national effort to reform the police.\u201d \u201cThere may be bite-sized pieces that Republicans can go for, but 2022 is probably going to be a lower turnout election \u2013 a typical midterm election, which makes it a base election,\u201d Newhouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how moving toward compromise on an issue like this helps motivate your base or even helps win you crossover votes. \u2026 Whatever bill the Democrats are pushing forward is probably going to go too far for most moderate Republicans.\u201d Cognizant of the challenging political terrain in Congress, the Biden administration has begun harnessing the powers of the executive branch to take a more active role on police reform. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced that the Justice Department has begun a federal civil probe into policing practices in Minneapolis to determine whether the police department has \u201ca pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing.\u201d Garland noted that the investigation will look at whether the department uses excessive force and will also examine its training, supervision and \u201cuse of force\u201d policies. Biden has also expressed confidence in the leadership of Vanita Gupta, who was confirmed as associate attorney general on Wednesday after GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska broke ranks with her party to back Gupta, stating that she has the skill and experience necessary to help \u201cto root out unconstitutional policing and reform our criminal justice system.\u201d But executive power has its limits, and ultimately both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have acknowledged that changing the laws in Congress offers the most lasting chance of reform. In the Senate, a real effort to seek compromise appears to be unfolding, led for Republicans by Scott \u2013 the only Black GOP senator \u2013 and for Democrats by Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey. For months talks have been complicated by disagreements over the issue of qualified immunity for police \u2013 a judicial doctrine that protects officers from being held personally liable for constitutional violations as long as they do not violate the law \u2013 and efforts in the House bill to make it easier to prosecute officers under Section 242 of the criminal code. Reform advocates say qualified immunity effectively offers police impunity to use excessive force in encounters with Black Americans. Still, Scott said the informal talks could wrap up in the next week or two. And Booker called his Republican colleague an \u201chonest broker.\u201d Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California, who authored the House bill, has said she believes Scott is sincere in seeking a deal, and on Wednesday he floated a potential compromise on qualified immunity. \u201cThere is a way to put more of the onus of the burden on the department or on the employer than on the employee,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cI think that may be a logical step forward and one that as I\u2019ve spoken with Karen Bass over the last several weeks is something that the Democrats are quite receptive to.\u201d Scott, who has offered a less sweeping bill than the one that passed the Democratic-led House, said changes to Section 242 language were \u201coff the table\u201d for him. Bass said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d on Wednesday that it was worth considering Scott\u2019s approach but that police officers needed to be held accountable, in comments that appeared to indicate sharp differences with the South Carolinian. \u201cQualified immunity and Section 242 \u2026 those are real key components to the bill, and we have to make sure that that\u2019s there,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Derek Chauvin felt so cavalier about torturing George Floyd to death.\u201d Any compromise on qualified immunity would have to pass muster with progressives and civil rights groups, who see it as vital to reversing decades of discrimination and brutality toward Black Americans. Progressive Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York told CNN on Wednesday that shifting liability from police officers to their departments would not be acceptable. Reformers argue that police officers must bear individual responsibility for their actions. \u201cThe core of the problem is that it is not just police departments as a whole \u2013 it is officers who are allowed to act with impunity,\u201d said Damon Hewitt, acting president and executive director of the nonpartisan Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. \u201cIs there anything that is a counterbalance to stop them doing the kind of things that Derek Chauvin did? Liability to the police department would, in my view, be insufficient to do that,\u201d Hewitt said. Advocates of retaining qualified immunity say that stripping it would cause officers to hesitate in sudden, dangerous situations when force might be necessary and when a failure to act could put them or civilian bystanders at risk. \u201cOfficers perform vital tasks requiring split-second decisions under intense circumstances,\u201d Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida said during a debate on the George Floyd Act ahead of its passage in the House in March. Gimenez argued that removing qualified immunity would lead officers to retire and would make the community less safe, as it would be \u201cimpossible for them to do their job.\u201d But while the debate, managed for Republicans by pro-Trump flamethrower Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, featured some principled arguments about the bill, it also bristled with the partisan politics that may doom Senate compromise. \u201cWhat this bill ultimately does is defund the police,\u201d said Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida, using a catchphrase popularized by Trump and conservative news opinion hosts to boost his hardline \u201claw and order\u201d narrative during the 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cYou say this is a reform bill. I say that is B.S.\u201d Terry Sullivan, a longtime Republican strategist and partner with Firehouse Strategies, said it remains to be seen whether leaders within the two parties can nudge their members to move beyond the current dynamic that has created so much paralysis in Congress, which he described as \u201can all or nothing game\u201d where \u201cyou\u2019d rather have an issue to beat your opponent over the head with\u201d than win a partial victory on policy. \u201cThis is a perfect example of the larger problem right now in Congress,\u201d Sullivan said, \u201cif, given the choice between short-term political victory and long-term policy goals, short-term political victory almost always wins out.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Justice Department has been making public what they\u2019ve learned about the Oath Keepers paramilitary organization \u2013 which had at least a dozen of its affiliates amid the Capitol riot \u2013 and this week revealed new details about the group\u2019s alleged discussions to arm themselves on January 6 or to arrange for others to back them up around the city. But the prosecutors also told a judge about the group\u2019s use of golf carts to race to the Capitol building \u2013 rebuilding one moment during the siege as illustrative of the Oath Keepers\u2019 push for violence, with a hint of buddy comedy. On one level the details appear comical but the descriptions add to a greater sense of the willingness among Oath Keepers to participate. One of the men, Robert Minuta, allegedly says during the chase, \u201cWe\u2019re en route in a grand theft auto golf cart to the Capitol building right now.\u201d Minuta and defendant Joshua James \u201cloaded into golf carts and began speeding toward the Capitol building\u201d about 90 minutes into the siege, the prosecutors wrote. Minuta, apparently driving one of the golf carts while talking about war in the streets, swerves around law enforcement vehicles that are trying to close routes in. James \u201cdoes not bail from the golf cart,\u201d the prosecutors note, \u201cbut rather punches the Capitol building address into his phone and audibly directs Minuta, aiding them in their endeavor.\u201d In court on Friday, James\u2019 defense attorney countered that the golf cart ride hadn\u2019t met any resistance by law enforcement at the time. There\u2019s video showing this, prosecutors say. One court filing this week includes a still image from a surveillance camera of the golf carts under an office building, circled in red. The video is not yet available publicly. After the Oath Keepers left the golf cart at an intersection near the Capitol and headed in on foot, they allegedly taunted law enforcement guarding the building, according to court filings. Appeals court ruling paves way for release of alleged Capitol rioters with extremist ties, but at least one Oath Keeper will stay in jail On Friday, Judge Amit Mehta decided to release James from jail as he awaits trial, especially given what the judge said was a history prior to January 6 as an upstanding citizen and Purple Heart recipient as a veteran. James will be on home incarceration and electronically monitored, and his communication will be restricted as well. \u201cMr. James, I\u2019ve got to tell you. I\u2019m not sure of why anyone in your position, given the life that you\u2019ve led, would do this,\u201d Mehta said at the hearing Friday. \u201cIt really does cut against what I think you stand for and what this country is all about.\u201d The judge also shared his thoughts on the attack generally, and the violent pro-Donald Trump reaction to the former President\u2019s election loss. \u201cWe treat everything like it\u2019s a battle to the death,\u201d the judge said. People who don\u2019t like the outcome of an election can\u2019t simply arm themselves to fight, Mehta added. \u201cThat\u2019s not how democracy works \u2026 Just because America disagrees with you doesn\u2019t give you a right to set up a quick reaction force.\u201d Prosecutors were seeking to cast him as a major leader among the Oath Keepers, but Mehta remarked that others charged in the case appeared to be on the top of the group\u2019s hierarchy. The 12 alleged Oath Keepers are charged with conspiracy and other crimes related to the siege, making it by far the largest criminal case to emerge from the Capitol riot. All of the defendants who\u2019ve appeared before federal district judges in Washington, DC, have pleaded not guilty. A few alleged leaders among the group are imprisoned, after Mehta or other judges deemed them to be threats to public safety or law enforcement. Others have been released to their home states to await trial. In the case, prosecutors also have fleshed out allegations of how members of the group discussed preparing for battle before January 6, met that morning, suited up in protective gear and infiltrated the crowd in a military-style \u201cstack\u201d formation, with hands on each others\u2019 shoulders. Minuta, for instance, wore battle gear including hard-knuckled gloves, ballistic goggles and a radio ear piece, and carried bear spray, prosecutors allege. Others in the group allegedly discussed what they called a \u201cQuick Reaction Force,\u201d or \u201cQRF,\u201d of armed comrades stationed around the Capitol to back them up with weapons, if needed. One defense lawyer has pushed back on the Quick Reaction Force, claiming it was a protective measure taken by the group. On Friday, prosecutors noted that James\u2019 Signal chats discussed with an unnamed person bringing a long rifle and side arm to the Capitol area, according to a court filing. \u201cSo, I guess I am taking full gear less weapons?\u201d another person allegedly asked James on January 2. \u201cYeah full gear \u2026 QRF will have weapons Just leave em home,\u201d James replied, prosecutors said. Prosecutors say James had also reached out to \u201coperational leaders\u201d on Signal to ask if \u201cwe have a farm location for weapons?\u201d Another leader in the group responded he wasn\u2019t aware of one, \u201cyet,\u201d prosecutors say. James\u2019 defense lawyers argued in court on Friday that his Signal chats prior to January were about planning to provide VIP security to prominent Republicans and not to plan an attack. Prosecutors have also used the Oath Keepers\u2019 alleged actions after January 6 to argue they could strike again or hurt the law enforcement investigation. \u201cAfter expressing to the others that they had lost after Trump conceded, the defendant took steps to conceal evidence or keep potential witnesses quiet,\u201d the Justice Department wrote in a court filing Thursday night. Prosecutors accuse James of \u201csurgically\u201d deleting a group chat on the messaging app Signal, after deeming then-President Donald Trump\u2019s concession of the election after the insurrection a loss. \u201cWe need to make sure that all signal comms about the op has been deleted and burned,\u201d James wrote to members of his team, prosecutors say. \u201cJust taking all necessary precautions,\u201d James added on the app. Another person on the thread confirmed he had deleted messages, prosecutors say. Photos on James\u2019 device from January 6 also were deleted, according to the court filing this week. With every court filing, prosecutors add to the list of unnamed, uncharged others who they believe interacted with Minuta, James and the other Oath Keeper conspiracy defendants around January 6. Two people whom prosecutors say James and Minuta spoke to throughout their joyride and breach of the Capitol, then met afterward nearby, are simply referred to as Person One and Person Ten in the indictment. CNN has previously identified Person One as Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes. Prosecutors say Rhodes had put Person Ten in command in DC that day. Neither has faced charges at this time. Prosecutors also haven\u2019t been shy about Minuta and James\u2019 connections to Roger Stone, the Trump confidante and key voice in the Stop the Steal movement. Previously, an FBI agent said in court that James was a driver for Stone and part of his security detail before the attack. Minuta is captured in video images acting as Stone\u2019s security on January 6 as well. Stone has not been charged with any crime related to the riot. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday. CNN\u2019s Emma Tucker and Hannah Rabinowitz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "As Congress debates new legislation on firearm restrictions in the wake of two high-profile mass shootings, the National Rifle Association is playing a diminished role. But thanks to years of shedding its claim to bipartisanship and aligning almost entirely with the Republican Party, the country\u2019s premier pro-gun lobby\u2019s agenda has firmly planted its agenda within the GOP, a legacy that continues to frustrate efforts to change gun laws. Once a powerful group respected or feared on both sides of the aisle, financial and legal problems in recent years have hobbled the NRA\u2019s ability to shape the political conversation around gun ownership and the Second Amendment. Neither the NRA nor its public face, executive vice president Wayne LaPierre, have made policy statements about the deadly shootings in Georgia and Colorado, beyond citing a \u201clongstanding rule to wait for all the facts\u201d before making such statements. And even while the possibility of passing the latest batch of gun-control bills remains remote \u2013 with a closely divided Senate and while the filibuster rule remains in place \u2013 the NRA is no longer the dominant voice against reforms it once was. Both Republican and Democratic aides have told CNN the NRA has not been much of a factor on Capitol Hill in recent months. Just this week, no one from the organization appeared at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on new bills passed by the House expanding background checks for private gun purchases \u2013 unlike in January 2013 when LaPierre appeared at a hearing a month after the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings. Some gun-control advocates sense an opportunity with what they see as a more favorable political climate and a weakened NRA. \u201cThe moment is now because we are stronger than we\u2019ve ever been as a movement and the NRA is weaker than it\u2019s ever been as a movement,\u201d said Shannon Watts, the founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun-control advocacy group. Still, a spokeswoman for the NRA, Amy Hunter, disputes that the organization is on a weaker footing. \u201cAs we have for decades, the NRA is leading the fight for gun rights on Capitol Hill, across all 50 state legislatures and in local governments across America. We will work to educate lawmakers on the Second Amendment and help them to make the best decisions for Americans and for our members. The NRA is strong and in good financial shape. Any suggestion to the contrary is wishful thinking on the part of our detractors,\u201d Hunter said. There\u2019s also an active lawsuit brought by Democratic New York attorney general Letitia James that seeks to dissolve the organization. The suit accuses NRA senior leadership of violating laws governing non-profit groups and using millions from the organization\u2019s reserves for personal use and tax fraud. Despite this, allies say reports of the NRA\u2019s death are greatly exaggerated. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a painful period of time for them, but my sense is they\u2019re coming through it,\u201d said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union and organizer of the Conservative Political Action Conference, where LaPierre spoke from the main stage last month. But the money suggests a different story. The NRA\u2019s recent woes \u2013 the organization filed for bankruptcy in January following a protracted leadership fight that saw the departure of its longtime chief lobbyist \u2013 have coincided with a decline in its political spending in the past two years. The NRA spent $29 million during the 2020 election cycle, more than half of what it spent just four years earlier, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The NRA also spent half as much on federal lobbying in the final two years of the Trump administration as it did during the first two years. GOP strategists say they don\u2019t expect the NRA will play so large an role in the 2022 midterm elections as it had in the past, such as when it spent more than $27 million in 2014 to help Republicans win the majority in the Senate. Still, it\u2019s not clear this smaller role in campaigns will immediately affect the policy debate, given the even partisan split in Congress and the procedural roadblocks requiring broad-based support for gun-related legislation to pass. \u201cThe NRA\u2019s power, real and perceived, has always been a function of its standing as an avatar for one of the most vocal and engaged constituencies in all of politics,\u201d said Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist. \u201cA diminished interest group may mean fewer millions being funneled into elections and advocacy campaigns, but it won\u2019t fundamentally alter the political proposition surrounding gun control policy.\u201d The NRA\u2019s setbacks of late obscure its impact within American politics and the debate over guns. Mostly nonpartisan for its first 100 years and during that time supportive of some gun control measures, the NRA began to lobby against federal firearm restrictions in the 1970s. It found allies among political conservatives, primarily within the Republican Party. The NRA has had a largely successful record in Washington. The group\u2019s most high-profile defeat came when Congress passed the assault weapons ban in 1994. But since then, it has successfully helped block every major legislative effort to restrict gun ownership on the federal level, from killing the renewal of the assault weapons ban in 2004 to marshalling opposition to more moderate efforts, like the 2013 Manchin-Toomey background-check expansion. Through the power of their letter-grade ratings of lawmakers, the NRA was able to brand politicians and, through its political action arm, endorse and support like-minded candidates. This has helped keep Republicans in Congress and, to a lesser extent in recent years, Democrats from rural states and districts in line. All that means there\u2019s little appetite among Republicans to find a compromise on gun legislation. The GOP has largely adopted the NRA\u2019s positions and messaging, said Brian Lemek, executive director of Brady PAC. \u201cThey are weakened, sure, but a lot of those folks didn\u2019t need the NRA to be vocal on guns,\u201d said Lemek. Even if the NRA is institutionally hindered now, its strength endures within the GOP, whose leaders remain almost wholly aligned with the group\u2019s positions. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy gave voice to this in a statement blasting House Democrats\u2019 two recent bills to expand background checks to private sales and close the so-called \u201cCharleston loophole\u201d that allows some transfer of guns to purchasers before completion of required background checks. Both bills received just a handful of Republican votes each. \u201cRepublicans unequivocally reject these misguided bills, and will always follow the Constitution so that the right to keep and bear arms, the cornerstone of our freedom, is not infringed,\u201d McCarthy said. There\u2019s been plenty of optimism from gun-control advocates about what the NRA\u2019s troubles mean for their agenda. Even so, some activists are skeptical that the disarray in the organization means a Democratic Congress can pass gun-control proposals easily, even with a Democrat in the White House. \u201cWe are already hearing from lawmakers in the Senate that they won\u2019t pass the House bill,\u201d said Lemek. \u201cJust that hands up, we aren\u2019t going to do it has caused a lot of concern for us in the movement.\u201d When asked if the fallout from these shootings will be any different to past tragedies, Lemek offered a deep sigh. \u201cEvery day feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,\u201d he said. Part of that skepticism comes from the persistence of the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule, which effectively requires a 60-vote threshold for voting on most legislation. But near-universal Republican opposition is another enduring hurdle \u2013 and it may be the NRA\u2019s most lasting legacy. The partisanship on guns is also reflected in the Democratic Party, which has moved to the left on guns as its coalition has moved into the country\u2019s suburbs. Several House Democrats who helped win the majority in 2018 ran explicitly on gun control in suburban districts, including in Georgia and Colorado, the sites of the latest mass shootings. But Democrats are limited by their own numbers in the Senate, including Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who has already said he opposes the background check expansion passed by the House. A centrist from a rural state with a high rate of gun ownership, Manchin is in a powerful position to determine what could pass in the evenly-divided Senate. \u201cThe most reasonable, responsible gun piece of legislation called Gun Sense which is basically saying that commercial transactions should be \u2026 background checked,\u201d Manchin told reporters Tuesday, explaining his opposition to expanding such checks to private purchases between people who know each other. \u201cI come from a gun culture, and I\u2019m a law-abiding gun owner who would do the right thing. You have to assume we will do the right thing,\u201d Manchin added. In that, he is a vestige of a time when Democrats actively courted NRA voters. Manchin ran an ad in his first Senate campaign in 2010 that features him shooting a rifle at a climate-change bill endorsed by the Obama administration while noting his endorsement by the NRA\u2019s political arm. The NRA also endorsed Manchin when he ran for a full term two years later. In a 2018 ad for Manchin\u2019s successful reelection, the West Virginia Democrat showed off his gun again, but without touting a NRA endorsement \u2013 which had gone that cycle, in a sign of the times, to his Republican opponent, Patrick Morrissey. There is just one Democrat currently in Congress with an NRA rating better than a \u201cC\u201d \u2013 Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, who rated a B. (The A-rated Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota was defeated for reelection last November by a Republican.) While the NRA\u2019s alignment with the GOP in recent decades gave the organization a short-term boost in an era of hyperpartisanship, it may have also accelerated the group\u2019s decline in influence in Congress in the long run. \u201cThe bottom line really is you know, the NRA is not the force it used to be,\u201d said Watts. \u201cThey used to be a power broker. Now they\u2019re just broken.\u201d Schlapp said he disagreed, predicting a \u201cspring season\u201d for the NRA in the coming months and years and that the organization remains a player in Washington amid the current debate. \u201cJust because you\u2019re not seeing a lot publicly, don\u2019t assume there aren\u2019t private conversations going on\u201d between lawmakers and the NRA, Schlapp said. But some gun-rights advocates are greeting the troubles at the NRA as an opportunity to reinvigorate a movement that had been on autopilot and too closely aligned with the GOP. \u201cI truly believe the vacuum is being filled by more sincere and better voices,\u201d said Rob Pincus, an NRA life member who has been a public critic of the organization\u2019s tactics and rhetoric in recent years. \u201cThe NRA statements and image have been the \u2018easy\u2019 button for media and politicians for too long.\u201d Pincus says the \u201cself-destruction\u201d of the NRA means a breaking of the monopoly the group had on representation of gun owners. \u201cElected officials and those who work inside the government are getting a much more diverse, and therefore accurate, picture of who owns guns in the United States, what the gun community is doing to reduce negative outcomes involving firearms and what gun owners are concerned about in regard to further retractions on our rights,\u201d Pincus said.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s actions during his final days in office have significantly increased his exposure to potential criminal prosecution, lawyers say, complicating his life after the White House. Over five days last week \u2013 beginning with a phone call to the Georgia Secretary of State directing him to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn the election to encouraging the pro-Trump crowd to \u201cshow strength\u201d in their march to the Capitol \u2013 lawyers say the President has put himself under the microscope of state and federal prosecutors. \u201cThere are potential state and federal crimes that he can be prosecuted for just for the things he\u2019s done this past week and what\u2019s troubling for him is he won\u2019t have the immunity from prosecution that DOJ say says a sitting president has as of next Wednesday,\u201d said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor. The new possible criminal exposure comes on top of ongoing New York state investigations into the President\u2019s finances and multiple defamation lawsuits related to Trump denying sexual assault accusations by women. The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office has a broad criminal investigation looking into allegations of insurance fraud and tax fraud. The New York attorney general has a civil investigation into whether the Trump Organization improperly inflated the value of its assets. The New York criminal investigation has been slowed by a fight over the President\u2019s tax records, a scrum that is again before the Supreme Court. The wait has stopped prosecutors from contacting Trump\u2019s private banker or seeking interviews with employees of the Trump Organization, people familiar with the matter say. Lawyers have speculated the court may be waiting for Trump\u2019s term to end next week before ruling. Sandick and other lawyers, however, say that as alarming as Trump\u2019s recent statements have been, there are multiple hurdles for prosecutors to prove that the President violated election laws or those relating to incitement or sedition. \u201cThe incitement ones are challenging if you only have evidence of his own words because they\u2019re sufficiently ambiguous that it would be hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d said Sandick. \u201cBut the evidence is not only his own words. He organized this event, he invited [Rudy] Giuliani and Congressman [Mo] Brooks to speak. They made statements that were far more expressive than Trump\u2019s own,\u201d said Sandick. \u201cIf you add into the case the fact that there may have been some coordination with the rioters and other speakers, then prosecutors could build a case against Trump,\u201d he added. On Tuesday, Trump defended his remarks, saying lawyers vetted them and said they were \u201cappropriate.\u201d Speaking at Joint Base Andrews before departing for Texas, Trump falsely said those who\u2019d analyzed his remarks had found no fault in them. \u201cIt\u2019s been analyzed,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople thought what I said was totally appropriate.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve analyzed my speech, my words,\u201d he continued. \u201cEverybody to a T thought it was appropriate.\u201d The new exposure Trump faces as he leaves office comes as the President is already part of a wide-ranging criminal investigation by the Manhattan District Attorneys\u2019 office, which is looking into a range of potential state crimes. He is also facing a civil investigation from the New York attorney general\u2019s office, which is looking at whether the President improperly inflated the value of his assets to obtain loans or favorable tax benefits. And, then, there are defamation lawsuits sparked by Trump denying accusations made by women who have alleged he assaulted them, including E. Jean Carroll, the former magazine columnist who has accused him of rape and Summer Zervos, who claims the President sexually assaulted her in 2007. Those cases have been delayed in the courts largely because of Trump\u2019s position \u2013 that will no longer be the case next week. Manhattan prosecutors have been interviewing individuals and examining evidence, but their investigation has been slowed as they wait for the Supreme Court to rule on a subpoena issued 16 months ago to Trump\u2019s accountant for the President\u2019s personal and business tax records. Cary Dunne, general counsel for Vance\u2019s office, told a judge in July that the subpoena delay has led to \u201ccontinuing concerns about the potential loss of critical evidence and expiration of statutes of limitations.\u201d In October, a federal appeals court found the subpoena was not overly broad or issued in bad faith, but the Supreme Court has not ruled for three months on Trump\u2019s request for a stay of the decision. As the dispute has lingered in the courts, key investigative steps have been on hold, those people say say. Prosecutors can\u2019t confront key witnesses without the documents or determine whether there is evidence that any laws have been broken, people familiar with the matter say. Investigators subpoenaed Trump lender Deutsche Bank for records in late 2019 and interviewed employees about underwriting practices after the election, but they were not involved in the Trump loans. Prosecutors have also not been in contact with Rosemary Vrablic, Trump\u2019s private banker at Deutsche Bank, which has loaned the President more than $300 million dollars, people familiar with the investigation said. Last month, Vrablic\u2019s lawyer said she is \u201ccommitted to cooperating with authorities if asked.\u201d Investigators also have not sought interviews with any employees of the Trump Organization, the people say. Lawyers for the New York attorney general\u2019s office, which has a lower burden of proof in civil investigations, have also dealt with delays. Eric Trump, the President\u2019s son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization, fought a subpoena for his testimony for four months until a judge ordered him to be deposed in October. One of Trump\u2019s tax attorneys is also in a back and forth with the state over the disclosure of certain records. The President\u2019s actions this past week have already cost him financially \u2013 the PGA of America said on Sunday night it would not hold its championship in 2022 at the Trump golf course in New Jersey and Deutsche Bank said it would not do business with him \u2013 and the specter of ongoing criminal investigations may have a longer-term impact on his business prospects. New York City announced Wednesday that it is taking steps to cancel contracts with Trump Org for the Ferry Point golf course and carousel and ice skating rink in Central Park. Trump\u2019s recent statements will present the Biden administration, which has made calls for unity, and his Justice Department with the dilemma of potentially prosecuting a former president. Biden\u2019s nominee for Attorney General, Judge Merrick Garland, has a reputation for even handedness. He also has experience with domestic terrorism cases having prosecuted the Oklahoma City bombers. \u201cThere\u2019s a long precedent of not prosecuting former presidents over policy differences,\u201d said Elliot Williams, a CNN legal analyst and former federal prosecutor. \u201cThe difference is we\u2019re not talking about policy difference here, and this is perhaps the most egregious conduct we\u2019ve ever seen from a president while in office. If they have chargeable offenses there\u2019s a really strong case to be made for pursuing them against President Trump.\u201d Some former prosecutors say that a lot of the conduct is morally reprehensible, but it isn\u2019t clear if it will cross the line into violating the law. Investigators will need to prove the President intended to commit crimes, a high bar in criminal cases, not that he was encouraging lawful protests or truly believed that he won the election. This weekend, in an interview with NPR, acting US attorney for Washington, DC, Michael Sherwin doubled down on his earlier statements that investigators are \u201clooking\u201d at any and all actors, including the President, Giuliani and others who revved up the crowd. \u201cLook, I meant what I said before. In any criminal investigation, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s a drug trafficking conspiracy case, a human trafficking case or the Capitol, all persons will be looked at,\u201d Sherwin told NPR. \u201cIf the evidence leads to any actor that may have had a role in this and if that evidence meets the four corners of a federal charge or a local charge, we\u2019re going to pursue it,\u201d he said. Like the riot, the legal liability for Trump\u2019s call to Georgia election officials will turn on his statements. Trump called the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, imploring him to \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 votes to give him the edge to overturn the election. It followed a call in December in which Trump told a Georgia elections investigator to search for dishonesty in the 2020 presidential election, telling the individual that the investigation was of national importance, according to a source with knowledge of the call. The calls have prompted letters and calls for state and federal investigations into Trump\u2019s conduct. It isn\u2019t clear if there is an active investigation. Former prosecutors say the outreach is worth federal prosecutors\u2019 scrutiny even if Trump wasn\u2019t successful because of the intimidation and threats the officials have faced. As the end of Trump\u2019s presidency nears, sources tell CNN Trump has considered pardoning himself, his family members and other allies from federal charges. Lawyers say it is not clear whether a self-pardon would hold up in court, but a presidential pardon has no bearing on state investigations. If Trump escapes his presidency without any criminal charges, lawyers say, his last weeks in office have assured him a place in history. \u201cEven if prosecutors don\u2019t end up charging him, the fact is that there\u2019s a basis here for investigating multiple different federal crimes at once,\u201d said Williams, adding, \u201cthere are a lot of mobsters who don\u2019t even have that many criminal investigations open involving them at one time.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: An earlier version of this story, published January 13, presented paraphrasing of the President\u2019s comments to the Georgia elections investigator as direct quotes. The story has been updated following the discovery of an audio recording of the call. Read more here.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump turned the Conservative Political Action Conference into his first post-presidential rally Sunday evening, pledging in a speech riddled with falsehoods to purge his enemies from the Republican Party and hinting repeatedly at another run for the White House in 2024. But before Trump closed out the annual conservative gathering, held in Orlando, Florida, this year, a cadre of ambitious Republicans eyeing 2024 presidential runs of their own tried to put their spins on Trump\u2019s populist message, echoing his grievances against big tech, the media and liberal \u201ccancel culture\u201d in efforts to tap into the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d base Trump built. Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley called for a break-up of leading tech companies. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem leaned into a cultural battle over statues of founding fathers. Florida Sen. Rick Scott promised not to intervene against pro-Trump candidates in primaries from his perch as the chairman of the Senate GOP\u2019s campaign arm. And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the GOP is \u201cnot just the party of country clubs,\u201d a reflection of Trump remaking the party\u2019s base into a largely White, rural and working-class coalition even as the former President lives at a private club he owns. Here are six takeaways from CPAC 2021: Trump devoted large portions of his speech, which lasted more than 90 minutes, to false claims about election fraud. He also said repeatedly that he could run for president again in 2024. And he suggested his near-term political focus will be on exacting retribution against the 17 Republicans in Congress who voted to impeach him in the House or to convict him in the Senate following the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. Trump teases 2024 presidential run in lie-filled CPAC speech Trump named each of those Republicans, saving for last Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, whom he called a \u201cwarmonger.\u201d He said they should all be ousted in 2022 primaries. \u201cGet rid of them all,\u201d he instructed the conservative audience. Trump concluded his speech by predicting that in the coming years, \u201ca Republican president will make a triumphant return to the White House.\u201d \u201cAnd I wonder who that will be,\u201d he said, in a typical nod toward a third campaign in 2024. \u201cI wonder who that will be. Who? Who? Who will that be? I wonder.\u201d The results of the famed CPAC straw poll for the 2024 GOP nomination were announced Sunday afternoon. Unsurprisingly, a 55% majority of attendees favor Trump in 2024 \u2013 his first-ever victory in the unscientific poll. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis came in second with 21% and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem in a distant third at 4%. It wasn\u2019t all good news for Trump, though: While 97% said they approved of the job he did as president, about one-third of a self-selecting, Trump-friendly\u00a0conservative crowd wasn\u2019t eager to back a Trump 2024 presidential bid. Just 68% said they wanted him to run for president again in 2024. Another\u00a015% said they don\u2019t want Trump to run, and 17% said they were unsure. 2024 Republican prospects seek their own breakout moments at Trump-dominated CPAC An informal and nonscientific survey, the CPAC straw poll can be a bellwether for the party \u2013 or, more often, a show of organizing strength. While 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney won four CPAC straw polls between 2007 and 2012, Trump won none of the four pre-2016 straw polls before his own nomination. In a second poll question that excluded Trump, DeSantis lapped the field in front of his home-state crowd in Orlando with 43% support. Noem finished second with\u00a011%, followed by Donald Trump Jr. at 8%, then former secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz with 7% each. No one else topped 3% in either straw poll. In both the poll that included Trump and the one that excluded him, former Vice President Mike Pence\u00a0finished at 1%. In the real world, the 2020 election was conducted fairly \u2013 though results were counted slowly in some states adapting to an influx of mail-in ballots amid the pandemic \u2013 and President Joe Biden won handily. But in Orlando, on CPAC\u2019s main stage, in offshoot panel discussions and in the crowd, Trump-promoted fantasies about the outcome being rigged were treated as truth well before the former President himself parroted the lies during his speech Sunday evening. Goya Foods CEO falsely says election was illegitimate, Trump is 'the real, the legitimate, and the still actual president' \u201cThere was widespread voter fraud in way too many states, most especially in big cities run by the Democrat machine. That is fact,\u201d Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union and a CPAC organizer, said in a panel discussion hours before Trump spoke Sunday. (It is not a fact.) Goya Foods chief executive Robert Unanue had claimed earlier in the day that Trump is \u201cthe real, the legitimate, and the still actual president of the United States.\u201d (Biden is president; Trump is not.) Hawley, the Missouri Republican who\u00a0objected to certifying electoral college votes from key swing states, effectively attempting to disenfranchise those states\u2019 voters and overturn the\u00a0results of the 2020 election, bragged about his efforts, claiming he was standing up for \u201celection integrity.\u201d\u00a0(His actions would have disenfranchised tens of millions of voters if successful.) Days after Cruz was discovered fleeing to Cancun to escape a snowstorm and the power and water outages it had caused in his home state, the Texas senator was spinning it into a joke. \u201cI gotta say, Orlando is awesome. It\u2019s not as nice as Cancun \u2013 but it\u2019s nice,\u201d he said as he kicked off his Friday speech at CPAC. The comment underscored how quickly Cruz has turned what appeared to be an embarrassing and damaging episode into a punchline \u2013 a jab at the political press. And if the crowd\u2019s laughter and cheers were an indication, he\u2019ll have escaped Cancun politically unscathed with the conservative base. One star of this year\u2019s CPAC might have been Noem, who was among the only speakers to articulate a vision of\u00a0conservatism that \u2013 while consistent with Trump \u2013 sought to more broadly define the party\u2019s principles. \u201cWe must more closely articulate to the American people that we are the only ones who respect them as human beings,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThat we are the\u00a0only ones who believe the American people have God-given rights. We are not here to tell you how to live your life, how to treat you like a child or\u00a0criminal because you go to church or you defend yourself.\u201d She bragged about her state\u2019s lax coronavirus restrictions, and echoed Trump\u2019s complaints about attempts to remove founding fathers from the public square, characterizing such moves as efforts to use those founders\u2019 flaws \u2013 such as slave ownership \u2013 \u201cto condemn their ideals and the greatest Constitution the world has ever seen.\u201d Noem, Hawley and Cruz were among the 2024 prospects that got the strongest reception. Another popular figure in Orlando: DeSantis, who kicked things off Friday morning with a message that previewed what was to come in the following days: A conference focused less on policy differences than on a willingness to fight against the left. \u201cNow, anyone can spout conservative rhetoric. We can sit around and have academic debates about conservative policy,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cBut the question is, when the Klieg lights get hot, when the left comes after you: Will you stay strong or will you fold?\u201d The brand-new Biden administration was almost an afterthought at the confab. The most forceful denunciation of the President was a characteristically over-the-top assessment from his immediate predecessor. \u201cJoe Biden has had the most disastrous first month of any president in modern history,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAlready the Biden administration has proved that they are anti-jobs, anti-family, anti-borders, anti-energy, anti-women and anti-science. In just one short month, we have gone from America first to America last.\u201d Trump\u2019s attacks on Biden were another norm shattered by the former President, who is not following prior ex-presidents\u2019 practice of staying quiet in the early stages of the new chief executive\u2019s term. Trump was also unique in that he was the only major speaker to offer much in-depth criticism of Biden at all. To the extent that the current President was mentioned by the event\u2019s other speakers, it was to criticize Biden as weak, ineffectual, and under the control of the Democratic Party\u2019s left wing. Cruz, for instance, mentioned \u201cJoe Biden and the radicals in his administration.\u201d While Pompeo went after the Biden administration\u2019s foreign policy moves, several speakers focused on familiar culture-war grounds. \u201cJoe Biden and his allies in Congress are promising to flat out decimate the Second Amendment and destroy the promise of liberty and freedom that is America,\u201d said Wayne LaPierre, the CEO of the financially troubled National Rifle Association, on Sunday.",

            "article_content": "Republican politicians, media personalities and activists are gathering this weekend in Florida for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, an event that could offer an early window into the party\u2019s 2024 presidential contest while also amplifying false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. Former President Donald Trump will be the star of the show in Orlando, delivering a Sunday afternoon speech \u2013 one in which he is expected to continue to falsely claim that the presidential election was stolen \u2013 that will mark his first public comments since leaving the White House. But starting Friday, a medley of potential 2024 presidential candidates are also looking for breakout moments that will launch them toward stardom. Their speeches will serve as a gauge of the conservative base\u2019s feelings about them as they begin to position themselves for possible runs. \u201cThe race for 2024 will start at CPAC,\u201d said American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, a chief organizer for CPAC. The lineup includes some of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies on Capitol Hill, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Utah Sen. Mike Lee, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. And it includes several of his strongest supporters from the states: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem. It also features several veterans of Trump\u2019s administration, including former secretary of state Mike Pompeo, former housing and urban development secretary Ben Carson and former White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is running for governor of Arkansas with Trump\u2019s endorsement. Trump\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr. and his girlfriend and Trump campaign aide Kimberly Guilfoyle are also speaking. Not on the list of speakers: Trump\u2019s intra-party critics such as Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. Also not appearing are former Vice President Mike Pence, who turned down an invite, and Nikki Haley, Trump\u2019s former United Nations ambassador who now finds herself isolated after tempered criticism of Trump. Schlapp said Haley had initially signaled she would address the conference but later backed out of an appearance. Haley did not respond to a request for comment. This year\u2019s CPAC is certain to demonstrate Trump\u2019s firm hold of the GOP \u2013 and the conservative base\u2019s eagerness to turn Trump\u2019s falsehoods about election fraud into policy action, as several state legislatures move to impose new voting restrictions. Seven panels or speeches at the conference are taking place under the title of protecting elections. The events appear to be little more than forums to advance unfounded Trump-world allegations that the election was stolen by President Joe Biden. Those accusations were rejected by Trump\u2019s own attorney general, William Barr, as well as dozens of court decisions, in some cases involving Trump-appointed judges. Schlapp acknowledged that much of the conference will be devoted to Trump\u2019s claims about the election. He said it would be \u201cbetter\u201d if conference participants also focused on Biden\u2019s agenda, though. \u201cMy thinking is it\u2019s fine to go through the atrocities\u201d of the past election, Schlapp said. \u201cBut better to rally folks to stop Biden policies.\u201d The event\u2019s theme is \u201cAmerica Uncanceled,\u201d a title that underscores another focus: \u201ccancel culture,\u201d or conservatives\u2019 belief \u2013 amplified since Twitter and other social media platforms banned Trump in the wake of the deadly January 6 insurrection \u2013 that expressing their views has placed them at risk of backlash. Trump\u2019s CPAC speech Sunday afternoon will serve as his resurgence into the political world, and according to a source familiar with his plans, it is not finished, with advisers still weighing in on how to make the most lasting impact. Some within Trump\u2019s circle are advising the former President to focus on 2022 and winning majorities of the House and Senate, which are both now controlled by Democrats. However, Trump and those who have pushed his anti-establishment agenda are instead considering a message without undertones of Republican Party unity that takes aim at Trump\u2019s intra-party critics, the source said. \u201cWe are going to war \u2026 but not physically,\u201d this source said in describing the sentiment. \u201cIt\u2019s primary season, and it\u2019s open season.\u201d But ultimately, those around him know that the speech that Trump gives Sunday will depend on what he decides he wants to say when he arrives at CPAC, despite what might be on paper in front of him. Trump is also likely to continue his lies about election fraud. \u201cIn the context of needed election reforms, yes,\u201d Trump senior adviser Jason Miller said about the former President\u2019s plans for Sunday\u2019s address. Trump has spent the last several days in meetings at Mar-a-Lago with Republicans who are clamoring to assure him of their allegiance. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale, former Trump Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and Miller have all been spotted at the former President\u2019s Florida residence over the past week. Many of Trump\u2019s meetings have focused on his political future \u2013 including his strategy going into the 2022 midterms and planning around \u201cif\u201d he runs for president again, the source said. While Trump continues to flirt with a 2024 bid, his focus now is on payback against those he believes crossed him. His advisers are in the process of identifying pro-Trump candidates to challenge Republican state officials in Georgia, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, who voted to impeach the former President, and others. While Trump continues to take meetings, the source said his inner circle is smaller than in the past \u2013 noting that Trump still feels betrayed by those who did not support his lies about election fraud and did not back him after the January 6 riot at the Capitol that Trump instigated with a speech encouraging angry supporters to march there. One of the ex-President\u2019s former advisers questioned CPAC\u2019s decision to welcome Trump back into the spotlight. It may be helpful for Trump to return to the stage as he attempts to solidify the Republican Party and eyes a comeback run for the White House in 2024. Still, the adviser argued, Trump\u2019s return is a setback for the GOP. \u201cFor him, yes. Bad for the party,\u201d the adviser said, adding that it\u2019s in Trump\u2019s nature to continue to peddle his baseless election claims. \u201cHe always faces zero consequences for his actions,\u201d the adviser said. \u201cWhy change now?\u201d Since 1974, CPAC has grown from a small gathering of a few hundred conservative activists to one of the largest annual political events in the country, regularly drawing thousands of attendees and speeches from top Republican politicians. For the first time in its nearly 50-year history, CPAC will be held outside of the Washington, DC, area in Orlando. Florida has emerged not just as a reliable red state but is the home to Trump and two other important conservative figures: DeSantis and Scott, both of whom will have high-profile speaking roles on the conference\u2019s main stage. Interspersed with policy panels and breakout sessions for activists, the main-stage speeches at CPAC offer ambitious Republicans the opportunity to speak directly to the conservative faithful. Ronald Reagan spoke at 13 total CPACs, including the very first meeting six years before he became the Republican nominee for president. Since Reagan, every GOP nominee has spoken at least once to CPAC \u2013 including those with strained relationships to the conservative movement, like George H.W. Bush and John McCain. The confab can give Republican hopefuls a chance to make a first impression or change their perception with the activist base of the party. In 2000, George W. Bush made his first appearance at CPAC, winning over the crowd with a speech criticizing outgoing President Bill Clinton while on his way to winning the GOP nomination and then the presidency later that year. Twelve years later, during his own successful bid to be the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney touted to the CPAC crowd his \u201cseverely conservative\u201d record as Massachusetts governor. One key feature of most CPACs is the presidential straw poll, an informal and nonscientific survey of attendees that can be a bellwether for the party \u2013 or, more often, a show of organizing strength. While Romney won four CPAC straw polls between 2007 and 2012, Trump won none of the four pre-2016 straw polls before his own nomination. Trump\u2019s own political career within the Republican party began in part at CPAC. He made his first appearance there in 2011, introduced by the event\u2019s director Lisa de Pasquale as someone who was \u201cthinking about tossing his hat into the ring\u201d for the 2012 GOP nomination. \u201cThese are my people,\u201d Trump said as the crowd cheered. \u201cThis is beautiful.\u201d Trump would not actually run until the next cycle, but his speech in 2011 had all the hallmarks of his 2016 campaign and term in office. He criticized the United States for being the \u201claughingstock of the world\u201d and claimed that the leaders of other countries were taking advantage of America. Trump stated he was \u201cpro-life\u201d and against gun control, Obamacare and raising taxes. Jumping among the day\u2019s news items \u2013 high gas prices, the sale of the New York Stock Exchange to a German company, the Somali pirate attacks \u2013 Trump boasted he would be able to handle it much better than the current leaders. \u201cHow about the Somali pirates?\u201d Trump said. \u201cHow simple would that be? Give me one good admiral and a couple of good ships, we\u2019d blast them out of the water so fast.\u201d He even antagonized some of the crowd, telling a vocal group of Ron Paul supporters in the audience that the libertarian Texas congressman \u201ccannot get elected.\u201d Trump would return to CPAC in 2013, 2014 and 2015 \u2013 always drawing large audiences thanks to his celebrity and his ability to speak the populist language of the activist crowd. He became a big donor to the American Conservative Union, the organization behind CPAC. Trump also spoke at the conference every year of his presidency. Ironically 2016, the year he won the Republican nomination, was the last time Trump did not appear at CPAC. In the midst of the GOP primary season, Trump backed out of his CPAC slot that year after some activists accused the CPAC organizers of being too close with him. Instead, he stuck to the campaign trail, including attending a massive rally in Orlando. Five years later, CPAC is coming to Orlando, practically in Trump\u2019s backyard. While a number of would-be presidential candidates for 2024 will use the opportunity to make a splash, their speeches will all be the warm-up act for Trump\u2019s big address on Sunday.",

            "article_content": "A Pennsylvania Republican state committee meeting Wednesday night concluded with no resolution on whether to censure Pennsylvania GOP Sen. Pat Toomey over his impeachment vote to convict former President Donald Trump. A source on the meeting\u2019s Zoom call told CNN that the more than four-hour meeting was hobbled by technical problems counting votes, and it\u2019s possible the committee could decide whether to take action against Toomey at a later date. Several Republican county committees across the commonwealth have issued censure resolutions against Toomey for his vote to convict Trump at the end of his second impeachment trial. Three GOP county chairs had told CNN the virtual meeting could have included a vote to formally censure Toomey. The state\u2019s Republican Party did not return a message seeking comment. Toomey is the latest in a series of Republicans who have faced censures and even primary challenges over their willingness to criticize Trump and his closest allies. The rebukes underscore the reality that, on the state and local levels and with the party\u2019s base, Trump remains overwhelmingly popular and there is little desire to cast him aside or move on to a new generation of leaders now that he is out of office. Michigan Rep. Fred Upton was censured by the Cass County Republican Party \u2013 for the second time, weeks after being rebuked over voting to impeach Trump \u2013 on Tuesday night for his vote to remove Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has voiced support for a number of wild and unfounded conspiracy theories, from the House\u2019s education committee. Upton was indignant, highlighting some of Taylor Greene\u2019s most controversial comments and actions to suggest she should be considered far outside the party\u2019s mainstream. \u201cShe taunted a Parkland school shooting survivor, argued that California wildfires were started by a Jewish space laser, accused Democratic politicians of running a pedophile ring out of a pizza parlor, and questioned whether 9/11 really happened,\u201d Upton tweeted. \u201cDoes the Cass GOP really think someone like that represents Republican values and should be serving on the education committee?\u201d Still, loyalty to Trump \u2013 or at least an unwillingness to publicly criticize him or penalize those who espouse the conspiracy theories Trump has given life \u2013 remains the default for most Republicans on Capitol Hill. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, who has clung tightly to Trump ahead of what\u2019s expected to be one of the hardest-fought Senate battles of next year\u2019s midterms as he seeks reelection, offered a false narrative about the January 6 riot at the Capitol during a Tuesday hearing. He said that \u201cfake Trump protesters\u201d and \u201cagent provocateurs\u201d were to blame \u2013 a baseless claim that obscures the reality that the rioters were Trump supporters who had been instructed to march to the Capitol in a speech delivered that day by Trump himself. Johnson\u2019s comments drew a sharp rebuke from one of the GOP\u2019s leading Trump critics. \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful for a sitting Senator to spread disinformation so blatantly. It\u2019s a disservice to the people he serves to continue lying to them like this. It\u2019s dangerous and it must stop,\u201d Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, another one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump, tweeted Tuesday. Still, even Republicans who have most frequently resisted and condemned Trump \u2013 including the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney \u2013 acknowledge that he remains the GOP\u2019s center of gravity, positioned to remain the party\u2019s standard-bearer if he decides to run for president again in 2024. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he will win the nomination,\u201d Romney said Tuesday in an interview with The New York Times. \u201cI look at the polls and the polls show that, among the names being floated as potential contenders in 2024, if you put President Trump in there among Republicans, he wins in a landslide.\u201d In Pennsylvania, a formal rebuke from the state GOP party would be largely symbolic and come at little cost to Toomey, who had already announced he does not plan to run for reelection in 2022. Lawrence County chairman Gale Measel told CNN that the \u201cemergency meeting\u201d was called last week and that committee members were merely advised that the meeting would be \u201crelative to the action that occurred at the Senate\u201d earlier this month. Measel told CNN that Lawrence County\u2019s executive board had voted weeks ago to censure Toomey and those who didn\u2019t stand up for Trump during his impeachment trial. \u201cI hope the entire body votes to censure,\u201d said Clarion County chairman Rick Rathfon, whose county committee was one of the first to take that action against Toomey back in February 9, the day Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial kicked off. At the end of Trump\u2019s week-long Senate impeachment trial, Toomey and six other GOP senators joined with Democrats in voting to convict the former Republican president. Trump was acquitted of inciting an insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the building demanding Congress stop the certification of the 2020 election. Trump\u2019s defense team argued that his conduct on January 6 was protected under the First Amendment and that the impeachment trial itself was unconstitutional because Trump is no longer in office. But Toomey said that there was \u201can overwhelming body of evidence\u201d that suggested the trial was \u201cconstitutionally permissible.\u201d \u201cNo president, or anyone else, has the First Amendment right to incite a violent attack on our government,\u201d he said in explaining his vote. GOP Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana were censured by their respective state Republican parties for their votes to convict Trump. Another Republican Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was already facing a censure effort by the Nebraska Republican Party, which postponed its vote until March. This story has been updated with additional developments.

            "article_content": "Congressional Republicans have crystallized an ominous question by rejecting consequences for Donald Trump over the January 6 riot in his impeachment trial and welcoming conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia into their conference: Has the extremist wing of the GOP coalition grown too big for the party to confront? Sanctioning Trump or Greene offered the party an opportunity to draw a bright line against extremist groups and violence as a means of advancing political goals. But the vast majority of congressional Republicans conspicuously rejected the opportunity to construct such a barrier through their decisions to oppose impeachment or conviction for Trump over his role in the US Capitol attack and to support Greene during the recent Democratic effort to strip her of her committee assignments. How a pro-Trump mob besieged the Capitol: A visual timeline Those choices unfolded against a backdrop of recent polls that found a stunningly high percentage of rank-and-file Republican voters endorsed anti- small-d democratic sentiments, including the belief that \u201cthe traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\u201d Why most GOP senators are standing by Trump In a survey released last week by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, not only did a majority of GOP voters endorse that statement, but nearly one-third of them also embraced the convoluted QAnon conspiracy theory Greene has espoused alleging that Trump is defending the nation against a global ring of influential child sex traffickers. Voters sympathetic to these conspiracy theories and the use or threat of violence as a political tool, says Daniel Cox, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who supervised the poll, have become \u201ca really important faction that the Republican Party is going to have to address. There is a part of the GOP that is really buying into this stuff.\u201d While Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has called conspiracy theorists like Greene a \u201ccancer\u201d on the party and denounced Trump\u2019s role in the riot, the recent decision by House Republicans to accept the Georgia Republican into the conference, and the overwhelming refusal by House or Senate Republicans \u2013 including McConnell \u2013 to sanction Trump, suggests the party has very limited appetite at this point for any serious effort to excise that disease. And that could provide more oxygen to the White nationalist extremist groups that have viewed Trump as a galvanizing figure and already gained strength during his presidency. Through their inactions on Trump and Greene, Republicans \u201care normalizing, they are mainstreaming, what counterterrorism experts would say is violent extremism: that it is acceptable to use inflammatory rhetoric and encourage violence to achieve your ends and \u2026 it is acceptable to engage in public life through conspiracy theories,\u201d says Elizabeth Neumann, a former assistant secretary for threat prevention in the Department of Homeland Security for Trump who resigned and opposed his reelection. The fact that threats from Senate Republicans to tie up legislative business helped persuade Democrats to withdraw their demands for witnesses at Trump\u2019s trial only underscores how difficult it will be to resist the infiltration of extremist ideas and tactics into the political system so long as the GOP is determined to avoid confronting it. They have fed the monster for so long that even when it turns on them, when the barbarians are literally at the gate \u2026 when they were the targets and they were prey, they still will not turn on it. That\u2019s how dangerous is the societal threat that we are facing. Republican consultant Michael Madrid That deference inside the GOP \u201cis a sign, a recognition, that this ideology, this belief, this tribalism is the ascendant part of the Republican coalition,\u201d says longtime Republican consultant Michael Madrid, who became a staunch Trump critic over the past four years. Elected Republicans bowing to Trump and Greene, he says, \u201care feeding the beast\u201d of the growing party faction drawn to extremist beliefs and tactics. \u201cI don\u2019t think most of them believe it; but they know that\u2019s where the party is at,\u201d Madrid adds. \u201cThey have fed the monster for so long that even when it turns on them, when the barbarians are literally at the gate \u2026 when they were the targets and they were prey, they still will not turn on it. That\u2019s how dangerous is the societal threat that we are facing.\u201d The exact share of the GOP coalition responsive to extremist White nationalist beliefs or the use of violence to advance political goals is impossible to measure precisely. But polling and other research suggests that the best way to think about it may be through concentric circles radiating out from hard-core believers willing to commit violence themselves to a much broader range of GOP voters who might not become violent personally but express sympathy or understanding for those who do.   The inner circle are the extremists actively participating in potentially violent White nationalist extremism. Neumann recently told me that number might total about 75,000 to 100,000 people. But polling has found a larger group of Republicans expressing sympathy for the attack on the Capitol \u2013 and a much larger group than that expressing sympathy more generally for the belief that the threats to American society as they define it have grown so great that force or violence is justified to respond to them. One-sixth to nearly one-fifth of Republicans have praised the January 6 attack in polling from PBS NewsHour/Marist and Quinnipiac. That\u2019s a far higher percentage than among the public overall (just 8% in the Marist survey and 10% in Quinnipiac.) In the American Enterprise Institute poll, about 3-in-10 Republicans said they believed the QAnon conspiracy theory. The share of Republican voters who express support for the use of force to advance their political goals in general is considerably larger. In the American Enterprise Institute survey, 55% of Republicans agreed that \u201cwe may have to use force to save\u201d the \u201cAmerican way of life.\u201d Roughly 4-in-10 agreed with an even more harshly worded proposition: \u201cIf elected leaders will not protect America, the people must do it themselves even if it requires taking violent actions.\u201d RELATED: Decoding Donald Trump\u2019s statement on his Senate acquittal The share of Republicans who \u201cstrongly agree\u201d with that sentiment \u2013 about 1 in 8 \u2013 is smaller and may be another measure of the share of the party coalition willing to personally consider violence. But even so, Republican opinion on these questions dramatically stands out from other Americans. Big majorities of Democrats and independents rejected both propositions. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty shocking,\u201d says Cox, the director of the American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Survey Center on American Life. \u201cWhen you look at those kind of statements, and realize how extreme that they are, it is absolutely concerning that they find a significant amount of support [among Republicans].\u201d The institute\u2019s new survey is far from the only study to document the spread of anti-democratic ideas, conspiracy theories and tolerance for violence within the GOP coalition. The institute\u2019s results almost exactly mirrored the findings of a national 2020 survey by Vanderbilt University political scientist Larry Bartels. Bartels found 51% of Republicans agreed with the statement that \u201cwe may have to use force\u201d to save \u201cthe traditional American way of life.\u201d In his study, just over 4-in-10 backed an idea similar to the second American Enterprise Institute question: the belief that \u201cA time will come when patriotic Americans have to take the law into their own hands.\u201d There were numerous opportunities over the last four years for historically mainstream Republicans to throw the switch and find an exit ramp. Trump and Trumpism is now a runaway train that is not going to be easily derailed within the Republican Party. Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO, Public Religion Research Institute Even more Republicans, of course, have consistently told pollsters they accept Trump\u2019s baseless claim that the election was stolen \u2013 even though his \u201cevidence\u201d was rejected by courts all over the country, including by many Republican judges. In the American Enterprise Institute poll, fully half of Republicans said the attack on the Capitol was engineered not by Trump supporters but by Antifa, a loose affiliation of leftist protesters \u2013 a claim utterly disproved by the evidence. And a huge share of Republican voters has seconded Trump\u2019s apocalyptic warnings \u2013 delivered even in his speech on the morning of the Capitol riot \u2013 that Democrats were trying to steal \u201cour country\u201d and transform it into something unrecognizable. In a mid-January poll by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, two-thirds of Republicans said that when Trump leaves office \u201cAmerica as we know it will be over\u201d and three-fourths described him as a \u201ctrue patriot.\u201d The sheer number of Republican voters aligning with all of those beliefs creates a huge headwind for those in the party who want to take a stronger stand against extremism and violence by isolating Greene and castigating Trump for inciting the attack. \u201cIt puts you in a difficult position to say in a full-throated way that this is wrong, and we reject it,\u201d says Cox. \u201cThat\u2019s what people are rightly worried about \u2013 that we need to come to a consensus that certain behaviors are well outside what is acceptable and need to be wholeheartedly rejected.\u201d At this point, he adds, within the GOP, \u201cwe\u2019re not seeing that.\u201d Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, agrees. All these findings about Republican voters\u2019 tolerance for violence and conspiracy theories, he says, present \u201ca chilling portrait of how far down the extremist tracks rank-and-file Republicans have gone with Trump.\u201d While \u201cthere were numerous opportunities over the last four years for historically mainstream Republicans to throw the switch and find an exit ramp,\u201d he adds, the attitudes Trump has solidified in the GOP base now make that much harder. \u201cTrump and Trumpism is now a runaway train that is not going to be easily derailed within the Republican Party,\u201d he says. They just legitimized a person that used tactics I would say 10 years ago, even five years ago, would have been abhorrent to the Republican Party. But President Trump has made bullying a key figure of the Republican Party now, so they know they can\u2019t condemn that behavior because they know the base loves it. Elizabeth Neumann, former assistant secretary, Department of Homeland Security Neumann, the counterterrorism expert, notes that by accepting Greene into their conference, Republicans have sent a clear signal to extremist groups that they do not consider it disqualifying to engage in extreme behavior such as her belligerent harassment of David Hogg, the teenage survivor of a school shooting and gun control activist. \u201cThey just legitimized a person that used tactics I would say 10 years ago, even five years ago, would have been abhorrent to the Republican Party,\u201d Neumann told me. \u201cBut President Trump has made bullying a key figure of the Republican Party now, so they know they can\u2019t condemn that behavior because they know the base loves it.\u201d Another dynamic further complicates the situation for mainstream Republicans. The GOP voters most likely to justify violence and express extremist anti-democratic ideas tend to be those also most receptive to the views that studies have shown are the best predictor of support for Trump: hostility to the demographic and cultural changes remaking America. As Bartels wrote in his study, \u201cThe strongest predictor by far of these antidemocratic attitudes is ethnic antagonism \u2013 especially concerns about the political power and claims on government resources of immigrants, African-Americans, and Latinos.\u201d The new American Enterprise Institute study underlines his conclusion, according to previously unpublished data provided to CNN. In that survey, a striking three-fourths of Republicans agreed with the statement that discrimination against Whites is now as great a problem in the US as discrimination against Blacks and other minorities. Social scientists view agreement with that question as a measure of denial of the existence of systemic racism in American society. The big majority of Republicans who consider discrimination against Whites as great a problem as discrimination against minorities were far more likely than those who disagree to endorse anti-democratic ideas. More than three-fifths of those worried about discrimination against Whites agreed that \u201cwe may have to use force\u201d to save \u201cthe traditional American way of life.\u201d Among the Republicans who believe minorities face more discrimination than Whites, nearly three-fourths disagreed with that statement. Nearly half of the Republicans who see widespread bias against Whites say Americans must consider violent action; almost four-fifths of the other Republicans reject that idea. Perhaps not surprisingly, the American Enterprise Institute survey also found that anti-democratic and extremist attitudes had penetrated most deeply in the portions of the GOP coalition that have provided the most die-hard support for Trump, including Republican voters without college degrees and White Christian evangelicals. Nearly three-fifths of White evangelical Christian Republicans said Antifa was mostly responsible for the attack on the Capitol, Cox found. An online study of Trump supporters conducted by two political scientists also spotlighted the role of racial and cultural anxiety in the spread of anti-democratic ideas through the GOP coalition. Political scientists Rachel M. Blum, an assistant professor at the University of Oklahoma, and Christopher Sebastian Parker of the University of Washington have recruited Trump supporters to participate in an ongoing internet study of their attitudes. After the assault on the Capitol, they asked if protesters \u201cwent too far \u2026 causing lasting damage at home and abroad\u201d or whether because \u201cthe election was stolen \u2026 it\u2019s easy to understand why Trump supporters showed up to protest at the U.S. Capitol.\u201d Trump supporters split in half on whether the protest was justified when the question noted the charges of fraud \u201cin states like Pennsylvania and Georgia.\u201d That result was stunning enough \u2013 but when the political scientists asked the same question while tying the fraud to \u201curban areas like Philadelphia and Atlanta, predominantly minority communities,\u201d the share of Trump supporters who said they could \u201cunderstand\u201d the invasion shot up to nearly two-thirds. In all their actions of the past few weeks \u2013 or more precisely the inaction against Trump and Greene \u2013 GOP leaders have signaled their unwillingness or inability to confront those sentiments too forcefully. Blum says that what appears to be happening inside the GOP is \u201can internal renegotiation that has dramatically changed which coalition members matter.\u201d The pre-Trump traditional Republicans are losing influence, she says, while the party is responding to the hard-core Trump voters motivated by a \u201csense of [cultural] threat, White grievance.\u201d It is, she adds, \u201clike George Wallace rose from the grave\u201d and imposed his priorities on the GOP. The 'urban myth' behind the GOP claims of voter fraud These attitudes don\u2019t suggest large numbers of Republican voters will pursue violent actions themselves; but, as the past few weeks show, they make it less likely that Republican leaders will clearly excommunicate such extremism. \u201cWithout drawing that bright line, you are ceding your party to this: a party of not living in facts, that bullying is acceptable behavior and that violence is acceptable behavior if you are trying to preserve your \u2018way of life,\u2019 whatever that means,\u201d says Neumann. \u201cThis will result in more people, especially within the echo chamber they are living in, seeing people that they disagree with as a mortal enemy, which for some small percentage of them translates into \u2018I have a justification for violence.\u2019 \u201c Madrid, one of the founders of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, agrees. The biggest challenge for the country, he argues, is not \u201cthe extremists\u201d themselves but \u201cthe enablers\u201d inside the GOP who are creating more oxygen for extremism to gain strength. The GOP\u2019s situation, he says, resembles the dynamic in Northern Ireland with the Irish Republican Army during the years of their violent resistance to British rule. \u201cThey would go out and blow things up,\u201d Madrid says. \u201cYou could ask Irish Catholics who would say, \u2018I\u2019d never be part of the IRA, but I kind of get what they are doing \u2026 They are on the right side; they\u2019ve got a point.\u2019 And that\u2019s where we are already at in the Republican Party, and that\u2019s what that polling data suggests.\u201d Trump is leaving minority votes on the table This tacit acceptance of extremists and violence carries a clear political risk for the GOP: a continued loss of support among racially moderate voters in the white-collar suburbs who already moved steadily away from the party under Trump. But if conspiracy theorists and other extremists solidify, or even expand, their beachhead in the GOP, the risk for the country could be much greater. The growing racial and religious diversity that triggers the retreat from democratic values among a growing number of GOP voters will only accelerate in the next decade. If the Republican Party does not find more will to explicitly renounce the dark forces circling around Trump, persistent outbursts of White nationalist political violence could be the deadly drumbeat for the years ahead. \u201cClearly they think that\u2019s where the base is and they can\u2019t change it,\u201d Neumann told me. \u201cBut I would argue we are at a moment where \u2026 if nobody steps up and tries to tell the truth and tries to lead people out of this echo chamber of stolen elections and [the belief that] violence is justified, that is catastrophic for the country. We will not survive as a democracy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The simple question posed by Donald Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial that begins Tuesday is whether a president who loses reelection can get away with a violent coup attempt in a desperate bid to stay in power. The answer contained in the former commander-in-chief\u2019s likely acquittal for inciting a deadly mob assault on the Capitol will echo through generations and may influence the outcome of some unknowable future test of US democracy. But more contemporary concerns that do not depend on the verdict of the Senate trial \u2013 like the consistent cowardice of Republicans who refuse to hold Trump to account and the effect of the evidence on the American public \u2013 are also hugely consequential since they will shape the modern political age. How to watch the Senate impeachment trial Events of the next week or so will inform the country\u2019s capacity to move on from a traumatic presidency that left it as divided as at any time since the Civil War. And the unpredictable partisan fallout unleashed by a trial unfolding inside an eight-foot high fence around the Capitol amid fears of more violence will have a direct effect on President Joe Biden\u2019s hopes of mustering the national will needed to conquer multiple crises. The trial will begin just a month after a now infamous day, when Trump greeted a huge crowd in Washington already primed for revolt by his weeks of false claims of election fraud. The subsequent invasion of the US Capitol during a joint session of Congress to certify Biden\u2019s election victory led to five deaths and saw Trump fans parading unimpeded through the halls of the iconic building as lawmakers fled to safety. By arguing that the trial is unconstitutional, politically motivated and an infringement of his free speech rights, Trump\u2019s defense will resurface a core theme of his tenure that a president is all-powerful and immune from censure for anti-democratic behavior rooted in a volcanic, autocratic temperament. Security at US Capitol on high alert for Trump impeachment trial A majority of Senate Republicans have indicated that they will not wrestle with Trump\u2019s behavior but will take refuge in a questionable argument that a President who was impeached while in office for seditious behavior cannot be tried after returning to private life. That means there is a little chance of a two-thirds majority to convict Trump among 100 senators who will serve as jurors in the chamber that became a crime scene to which many of them were witnesses.   But Democratic House impeachment managers will argue that if whipping up a rebellion against the peaceful transfer of US power is not an impeachable offense, nothing is. The prosecution case will unveil evidence of the horror unfolding in the Capitol that will make clear that the US political system was forced right to the brink. While the managers will likely fail to secure a prohibition on Trump serving in federal office in future, they hope to so damn him in public perception that a political comeback in 2024 will be impossible. Video of Trump declaring to an angry crowd he had called to Washington on January 6 \u201cif you don\u2019t fight like hell, we are not going to have a country anymore,\u201d followed by clips of rioters shouting \u201cfight for Trump\u201d as they smashed their way into the Capitol will have a powerful effect. They will also make uncomfortable viewing for GOP senators who spent four years ignoring Trump\u2019s lawless conduct for their own political preservation. The price to be paid for deserting an ex-president who still dominates his party is being demonstrated by the backlash directed at 10 Republicans who voted to impeach in the House. What we know about how Trump's second impeachment trial will go The trial, however it ends, will mark an extraordinary and appropriate capstone to the most divisive presidency in American history that tore at the basic political guarantees laid down by the founders nearly 250 years ago. At a moment of acute national crisis, amid a pandemic and economic disaster exacerbated by Trump\u2019s neglect in office, the trial will open a window into America\u2019s bitterly fractured unity. Even after his presidency ended, Washington is under siege from extremism, Trump\u2019s trashing of truth with false claims of election fraud and unhinged conspiracies that show the fight to save US democracy did not end on Inauguration Day. It\u2019s possible a handful of Senate Republicans will emulate Utah\u2019s Sen. Mitt Romney, the only member of his party to vote to convict Trump in his first trial. And Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who voted to impeach Trump, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post Monday encouraging Senate Republicans to vote to convict Trump, saying it \u201cis necessary to save America from going further down a sad, dangerous road.\u201d But Trump is convinced he will be acquitted. His own concerns about accountability are confined to Republicans such as Rep. Liz Cheney who ignored his personality cult and voted to impeach, sources told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. From the balmy luxury in his Florida resort, the ex-President turned down a Democratic request to testify in his own defense, a factor that House impeachment managers will use to bolster legal arguments condemning him. The trial will consume hours a day over the next few weeks, but it will be only one half of a compelling political story that is unfolding in Washington. Biden, three weeks into his term, is intensifying his efforts to stand up his administration and to rescue the country with vaccines before new variants of Covid-19 trigger another deadly wave of infections. The new commander-in-chief has steered clear of impeachment drama, leaving it to the new Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill to plow ahead. But Biden, who is pushing $1.9 trillion dollar pandemic relief plan, has a vested interest in the Senate wrapping up the process as quickly as possible. \u201cThe Senate has to work it out,\u201d the President told reporters at the White House on Monday when asked if his predecessor should be deprived of his future political rights and the privileges granted to a former president. Trump tells aides he thinks he'll be acquitted as he remains fixated on 'accountability' for GOP lawmakers who voted to impeach Trump\u2019s hurriedly overhauled impeachment defense team on Monday laid out their strategy in pre-trial briefs. They will first argue that the process is unconstitutional and motivated by a political vendetta. \u201cThis was only ever a selfish attempt by Democratic leadership in the House to prey upon the feelings of horror and confusion that fell upon all Americans across the entire political spectrum upon seeing the destruction at the Capitol on January 6 by a few hundred people,\u201d the lawyers wrote. The Trump defense will also revive one of the long-held tropes of the ex-President\u2019s apologists \u2013 that his aggressive rhetoric should be taken figuratively not literally, with a claim that his call for the mob to \u201cfight like hell\u201d was metaphorical. The lawyers have also previously made clear that they will claim that impeaching Trump for his wild lies about election fraud deprives him of his First Amendment right to free speech. His team has also posited, despite multiple lawsuits and certifications of votes by states and Congress, that there is no evidence to disprove his false claims of voter fraud \u2013 so prolonging the Big Lie that the election was stolen from the former President. In a counter filling on the eve of the trial on Monday, Democratic House impeachment managers accused Trump\u2019s defense of indulging in \u201ccontortions\u201d to support his discredited claims of a \u201crigged\u201d and \u201cstolen\u201d election. And they argue that the evidence of Trump\u2019s basic crime against the Constitution is overwhelming. \u201cPresident Trump violated his Oath of Office and betrayed the American people,\u201d the brief said. \u201cHis incitement of insurrection against the United States government \u2013 which disrupted the peaceful transfer of power \u2013 is the most grievous constitutional crime ever committed by a president.\u201d House prosecutors may also seize on filings by some of the many pro-Trump protestors arrested over the Capitol incursion. One defendant, Matthew Miller, argues that he was \u201cfollowing the directions\u201d of Trump to march on Congress. Another alleged rioter \u2013 the so-called Qanon Shaman, Jacob Chansley \u2013 told CNN on Monday, \u201cI am deeply disappointed in former President Trump. He was not honorable,\u201d and his lawyer said he had \u201cheeded the words of the former President.\u201d The relatively uncomplicated nature of the charge against Trump and the more compressed nature of the trial contrasts with his first impeachment that resulted in his acquittal last year, over claims he abused his power to get Ukraine to intervene in the election to damage Biden. Trump now accounts for two of the four presidential impeachments in US history. Trump lawyers argue former President did not incite riots by telling supporters to 'fight like hell' The claim that a former president cannot be tried after being impeached relies on a hyper-literal reading of the Constitution. Trump\u2019s supporters argue the trial is moot since impeachment is about removing a President from office and Trump has already left power. But some legal analysts counter that the trial is supported by precedent following the impeachment of several former officials or judges in US history and is also validated by the provision in the Constitution for officials to be barred from future federal office. Conservative legal scholar and frequent Trump critic George Conway told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Monday that the former President was also rightly impeached because when the violence was raging on January 6 \u2013 during the congressional process designed to certify the election of a new president \u2013 he failed in his obligation to defend the Constitution and the American people. \u201cHe wanted something to disrupt the electoral vote count that would mean he would no longer be President of the United States,\u201d Conway said. \u201cNone of that is protected by the First Amendment. It\u2019s a flat out violation of his oath of office and it\u2019s impeachable and he should be punished by being barred from ever holding future federal office.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Lauren Fox, Jim Acosta, Katelyn Polantz and Caroline Kelly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Faced with a barrage of bills to clamp down on ballot access around the country, some voting rights advocates are pinning their hopes on Congress and urging Democrats on Capitol Hill to use their slim majority to pass a sweeping election reform and voting rights package \u2013 even if they have to torpedo the filibuster in the Senate to make it happen. The stakes are high: A recent analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice found three times as many pieces of legislation at the state level to restrict voting access as there were at this time a year ago. And this week, lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Georgia Senate added more. They include proposals that would eliminate no-excuse absentee voting for many state residents and end automatic voter registration when obtaining a driver\u2019s license. The voting bills in Congress \u2013 which Democrats have said are an early priority \u2013 would establish at least 15 days of early voting in federal elections, allow for automatic voter registration, restore voting rights to former felons and bar states from prohibiting mail-in and curbside voting \u2013 along with a slew of other changes to election and campaign-finance laws. But they have run into GOP opposition, particularly in the Senate, where the chamber has a 50-50 partisan split with Vice President Kamala Harris in a position to break ties. Under Senate rules, 60 votes are needed cut off debate or end the \u201cfilibuster\u201d of legislation \u2013 giving the Republicans now in the minority a powerful tool to block the voting-rights measures and other Democratic priorities. \u201cYou have an absolutely necessary piece of legislation to restore our democracy,\u201d Wendy Weiser, a top official at the Brennan Center, said of the voting-rights package pending in Congress. \u201cThe filibuster absolutely shouldn\u2019t stand in the way of accomplishing it. \u201cCongress needs to set out a baseline set of rules and voting procedures that every American can rely on,\u201d she added. Ns\u00e9 Ufot, who runs the New Georgia Project voting rights group, called the legislative filibuster an \u201canti-democratic\u201d tool used \u201cto stifle the will of the people and make it difficult to get anything of note done.\u201d Democrats \u201cwho are hand-wringing\u201d over the future of the filibuster, she said, \u201cneed to know that they don\u2019t have the support of the people if they move to protect it.\u201d Still, activists face difficult odds in the Senate where Republicans \u2013 and some Democrats \u2013 support retaining the filibuster. Speaking to the conservative Heritage Foundation earlier this week, Sen. Mike Lee, a Utah Republican, said the 60-vote threshold encourages bipartisan cooperation by requiring both political parties \u201cto check our own ambitions.\u201d Eliminate the filibuster, Lee said, and \u201cour politics would almost certainly sink to an even angrier and more toxic level.\u201d The 2020 election shattered turnout records, as states around the country made it easier to cast ballots in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, and activists made an all-out push to turn out voters and help them navigate new voting rules. In all, nearly 160 million people voted \u2013 or roughly two-thirds of the US\u2019 voting-eligible population, according to the US Elections Project. Now, lawmakers around the country are moving to pass new restrictions. In Arizona, which flipped to President Joe Biden last November, some lawmakers want to remove voters from a permanent early voting list, which allows voters to automatically receive a ballot by mail for every election. In Georgia, where voters backed Biden in November and elected two Democrats to the US Senate in runoff elections last month, Republicans in the state Senate want to ban the use of ballot drop boxes and require photo identification for those who choose to vote by mail. One Georgia measure also would restrict mail voting to only those who are 75 or older, absent from their precinct, observing a religious holiday, have a physical disability, are required to provide care for someone who is disabled, or required to work \u201cfor the protection of the health, life, or safety of the public\u201d during polling hours. \u201cReactionary rollbacks is the phrase that comes to mind,\u201d Hannah Fried, national campaign director of All Voting is Local, said of the new state proposals. Her organization, part of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, works on voting rights issues in eight states, including Arizona and Georgia. \u201cWhat we are seeing is that the people spoke on November 3, and they spoke again in Georgia in January and that has brought out some of our country\u2019s worst impulses,\u201d Fried said. \u201cThis is not the first time that when we have seen progress made \u2013 powered by Black voters \u2013 that there are then efforts to make it harder for that community and other voters of color to cast their ballots,\u201d she said. Although the courts, state election officials and the US Justice Department found no evidence of widespread fraud in the 2020 election, former President Donald Trump made relentless and false claims that the election had been stolen from him.  And Republican lawmakers now cast their bills as measures needed to shore up public confidence ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cEven those of us who never claimed that the election was stolen recognize that the electorate has lost confidence in the legitimacy of the system,\u201d Georgia state Sen. Butch Miller, a Republican and president pro tempore of the state Senate, said in a statement emailed to CNN. \u201cWe must work to restore that.\u201d In Arizona, Republican state Sen. Michelle Ugenti-Rita, who chairs the state Senate elections committee, said the bills there are needed to build security in the mail-in voting process. \u201cIn Arizona mail-in balloting is very popular, but as you can see a lot of the bills deal with mail-in ballots because mail-in ballots do lend themselves to being exposed to a lot of unintended consequences,\u201d Ugenti-Rita told CNN. Georgia and Arizona, where Republicans control both the state legislatures and governors\u2019 seats, are crucial to Democrats\u2019 political fortunes in the US Senate. Two Democratic senators \u2013 Arizona\u2019s Mark Kelly and Georgia\u2019s Raphael Warnock \u2013 elected recently in special elections will be on the ballot again next year. Democratic lawmakers and activists in Georgia say Republicans in the state legislature have the votes to prevail in the end. \u201cThey will pass it, but it won\u2019t be because we didn\u2019t fight for it,\u201d said Sen. Gloria Butler, a top Democrat in the Georgia Senate. Democratic activists have long targeted the filibuster \u2013 an obscure procedural tool that remains a powerful weapon. Last year, former President Barack Obama added his voice to those calling for an end to the legislative filibuster if needed to pass voting-rights measures. Modern-day filibusters don\u2019t much resemble Jimmy Stewart\u2019s fictional talkfest depicted in the 1939 film \u201cMr. Smith Goes to Washington.\u201d Instead, under current rules, senators don\u2019t need to hold up floor action by talking. They just signal their objection, forcing the majority to come up with 60 votes. Each party has chipped away at the filibuster in recent years to bypass opposition from the other side of the aisle: In 2013, Senate Democrats eliminated the filibuster on judicial and executive nominations. And in 2017, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans ended the filibuster on confirmation for Supreme Court nominees to push through Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination to the high court. McConnell and other Republicans in the Senate minority oppose gutting the filibuster. And the Democratic voting rights measures are part of a sweeping bill that seeks broad change, including provisions that require greater disclosure of political spending that McConnell long has opposed. This year, a stalemate over the rights of the minority to stall legislation delayed finalizing a power-sharing agreement in the evenly divided Senate. McConnell had sought written assurances from Democrats that they would not tamper with the filibuster. But he relented after two moderate Democrats \u2013 West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema \u2013 reiterated their long-standing opposition to dismantling the filibuster \u2013 another sign of the potential obstacles ahead for progressive activists. And McConnell has warned that abolishing the filibuster would create \u201ca scorched-earth Senate,\u201d with Republicans using procedural tactics to slow action on bills. In a recent speech on the Senate floor, the Kentucky Republican said setting a 60-vote threshold for legislative action allows bipartisan deliberation and \u201censures narrow interests cannot ignore the rest of the country.\u201d Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley, one of the lead sponsors of the Democrats\u2019 elections package, has floated several ideas for reining in the ability of the minority party to block legislation that stop short of gutting the 60-vote requirement entirely. They center on carving out an exception to the filibuster rule for election-related legislation or returning to \u201ctalking\u201d filibusters that require senators to actually debate on the floor if they want to stall action on a bill. Fred Wertheimer, a veteran elections reform activist who runs Democracy 21, said Senate Democrats need to decide. \u201cThe choice is going to come down to whether we are going to fix our democracy or live with an antiquated filibuster rule,\u201d he said. Ufot, whose organization was among those at the forefront of voter outreach efforts in Georgia in recent elections, said the Senate should return to the traditional talkathon filibusters \u2013 even as it requires objectors to stage hours of debate on the Senate floor. \u201cYou go down to the well. You put on a diaper. You put on some comfortable shoes, and you talk,\u201d Ufot said. \u201cIf a person feels so passionately and fervently about something, then they should be forced to engage the American people in that way.\u201d Without federal legislation, activists like Ufot say they envision years of protracted battles in the states over voting laws. \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight these same fights for 10 years,\u201d Ufot said.",

            "article_content": "The FBI recently raided the homes of two men who sponsored an invective-laced rally near the US Capitol a day before the deadly insurrection, the first known search warrants involving people who organized and spoke at rallies preceding the attack. CNN learned of the raids through an eyewitness account, public records, a lawyer representing one of the rally organizers and an FBI spokeswoman who confirmed details of the searches. FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller confirmed that federal agents executed search warrants last week at two properties in Orange County, California, which public records indicate belong to Russell Taylor and Alan Hostetter. The two men run the American Phoenix Project, which co-sponsored a pro-Donald Trump rally near the Supreme Court on January 5, one day before the attack. Neither man has been charged with any crimes. Footage of the rally shows the men spewing militant vitriol: Hostetter told the crowd to prepare for \u201cwar tomorrow\u201d against \u201cvipers\u201d in Congress who refused to nullify President Joe Biden\u2019s win. Taylor said, \u201cWe will not return to our peaceful way of life until this election is made right.\u201d Court documents related to the search warrants are still under seal, but the raids are the first publicly known federal actions against people who organized rallies linked to the Capitol attack. Federal investigators have issued more than 500 subpoenas and search warrants in the probe. A key question about the fledgling investigation has been how aggressively prosecutors will scrutinize the people who organized and spoke at rallies that preceded the stunning assault. Taylor and Hostetter are well-documented promoters of conspiracy theories ranging from QAnon and the \u201cdeep state\u201d to those related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential election. An FBI spokesperson told CNN the search was conducted at the property Taylor owns at 6 a.m. Wednesday. CNN obtained photos and videos of FBI agents at his house hours later. Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department declined to comment further about the raids or what investigators were searching for, noting that the case files are still sealed. A lawyer for Taylor, Dyke Huish, told CNN that the agents were \u201cjust gathering information on people that were at or near the Capitol building on the day in question,\u201d referring to January 6. Huish said Taylor \u201ccooperated with investigators\u201d and the search was finished \u201cwithout incident.\u201d Eimiller, the FBI spokeswoman, said \u201cno arrests were made\u201d during the searches. Taylor acknowledged the raid on his Orange County home in a Telegram post on Friday. Using a pseudonym, Taylor urged his followers to \u201chold the line,\u201d adding, \u201cI am working with a lawyer and per his recommendation he said to keep on the down low for a bit to stay off any radars.\u201d Hostetter didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment about the raid or his DC rally. The founder of the group that co-sponsored the rally, Virginia Women for Trump, told CNN that she hasn\u2019t been interviewed by the FBI. An employee at Women for America First, a separate organization that held the rally near the White House with Trump one day later, told CNN that nobody at the organization had been interviewed by the FBI either. Through their right-wing organization, Taylor and Hostetter secured speaking slots at the rally, and used their speeches to spew violent, battle-ready rhetoric. Weeks earlier, they reached out to Virginia Women for Trump, which was planning an event at the Supreme Court on January 5, one day before Congress would tally the electoral votes and put the final nail in the coffin of Trump\u2019s effort to overturn his loss. Alice Butler-Short, founder of Virginia Women for Trump, said she primarily organized the rally and invited the speakers, but Taylor and Hostetter helped pay for the logistics and security. \u201cThey kind of found me on Facebook,\u201d Butler-Short said in an interview with CNN. The lineup of speakers also included the far-right conspiracy theorist Ali Alexander, who ran a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d group, and Trump ally Roger Stone, who supports the Proud Boys extremist group. They pushed the debunked conspiracy theory that the election was stolen from Trump. Though Stone said, \u201cWe renounce violence,\u201d Hostetter ratcheted things up is his speech. \u201cWe are at war in this country,\u201d Hostetter said. \u201cWe are at war tomorrow.\u201d He continued, \u201cOur voices tomorrow are going to put the fear of God in the cowards and the traitors, the (Republicans in name only), the communists of the Democrat Party, they need to know we as a people, a hundred million strong, are coming for them If they do the wrong thing.\u201d \u201cI will see you all tomorrow at the frontlines,\u201d Hostetter said as he ended the speech. \u201cWe are taking our country back.\u201d Taylor expressed support for QAnon in his speech and issued a call-to-arms, saying, \u201cIn these streets we will fight, and we will bleed before we allow our freedom to be taken from us.\u201d (Huish, his attorney, later claimed he was speaking metaphorically and \u201chas never called for violence.\u201d) Taylor\u2019s lawyer tried to distance his client from the mob that invaded the Capitol, saying Taylor was \u201coutside\u201d but \u201cnever entered the building nor did he cause any damage to the building.\u201d \u201cHis sole purpose in going to Washington DC was to participate in a peaceful and patriotic protest in those things that he believes to be true and correct,\u201d Huish told CNN in a statement. In a since-deleted Instagram video from January 6, Hostetter said he was avoiding the Ellipse because he had \u201cgear\u201d that wouldn\u2019t be allowed in. In another video obtained by CNN, Taylor said he was walking towards the Capitol and said he was just informed that rioters had breached barricades near the building. He is wearing a flak jacket with what looks like a knife sticking out. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if the Capitol Police are oath keepers of the Constitution,\u201d Taylor is heard saying. Photos from Hostetter\u2019s Instagram and photojournalists place him and Taylor just outside the Capitol building during the riot. An AFP photographer snapped an image of Taylor giving police the finger around 4:30 p.m. near the North side of the Capitol, near the entrance to the Senate. Two other photos show Taylor near a police line on the North side of the Capitol. One photo shows him using his body to push against a police line; the other shows him near a police line with what appears to be a gas mask. He later wrote on Facebook that he never made it inside.

            "article_content": "The Republican civil war hits a critical moment on Wednesday over the fate of two prominent lawmakers who represent rival visions for a party torn by the toxic but still powerful influence of Donald Trump. Real-time reckonings for third-ranked GOP House leader Liz Cheney and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a freshman congresswoman who has espoused outlandish and dangerous conspiracy theories, will help establish the extent to which a loyalty oath to the ex-President remains the party\u2019s dominant principle. Cheney is expecting to confront a venting session over her vote of conscience to impeach Trump in the House Republican Conference on Wednesday. In the coming days she faces a fight to hang onto her leadership post. She is also confronting a potential primary challenge at home over her decision. Party leaders will meanwhile resume consideration of whether to censure Greene, who spent several hours in a meeting with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday evening. There is pressure from Democrats and Senate Republicans for her to lose committee assignments over offensive social media activity before she ran for office and her behavior in only a month as a Georgia representative. House Republicans weigh stripping Greene from committee assignments as GOP senators repudiate her views The challenges facing Cheney and Greene encapsulate the raging battle for the control of the GOP between orthodox conservatives and pro-Trump radicals who are viewed by the establishment as a \u201ccancer\u201d and \u201cwacky weeds.\u201d Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is the epitome of the old school, ultra-conservative but internationalist Republican Party that disdains Trump\u2019s assault on democracy. Greene is a proponent of the QAnon conspiracy theory and is an avatar of the wild fringe welcomed into the GOP by Trump. McCarthy\u2019s painstaking effort to walk a line between the wings of the party represented by the two lawmakers was made immeasurably more difficult when, according to Greene, she and Trump spoke in a recent phone call, The former President\u2019s power play came after he received McCarthy for an audience at his Florida resort. The visit was a stunning indication of how Trump is still calling the shots for much of the House GOP \u2013 even after his mob invaded the Capitol in a January 6 insurrection In a somber reminder of the cost of Trump\u2019s actions, President Joe Biden traveled to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to honor fallen Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick who died as a result of the assault. Sicknick\u2019s cremated remains lay in repose in the very Rotunda breached by Trump\u2019s rioters nearly a month ago. The volatile state of the GOP is evident in the way that Cheney faced far more public criticism from her House colleagues than Greene, an advocate of a fringe conspiracy theory anchored on baseless claims that Democratic leaders are pedophiles. Two officials familiar with her meeting with McCarthy told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Tuesday evening that the GOP Steering Committee has not decided whether to strip Greene of her committee posts. There was no indication that Greene has shown any remorse for her extreme behavior, which includes past support for the assassination of top Democratic officials, 9/11 trutherism and claims that the Parkland, Florida, school massacre in 2018 was a false flag hoax. McCarthy asked if Greene would apologize for her past comments and views, which she did not agree to, a person with knowledge of the matter tells CNN.  Another person familiar with their conversation also said that McCarthy provided a slew of options to her, including that she could show remorse and apologize. Top GOP senators, like Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have defended Cheney. But emphasizing her growing estrangement from the GOP House caucus, a Trump acolyte, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, even traveled to Wyoming last week to rally against her and to initiate an effort designed to end her career. The visit underscored how Trump\u2019s loyal base is still dictating the party\u2019s direction, even with the ex-President out of the White House and as some GOP power players hope his influence will fade. The tussle that is tearing the House GOP apart \u2013 and alienating its members from their brethren in the Senate \u2013 is coming at an especially fraught moment with the second Trump impeachment trial set to start in the Senate next week. The former President\u2019s team indicated Tuesday that it intends to once again highlight Trump\u2019s dangerous lies about a stolen election, while Democrats present graphic evidence of his insurrection that will discomfort GOP senators. Cheney shoring up GOP support behind the scenes ahead of crucial conference meeting The outcome of the drama involving Cheney and Greene are skirmishes in the wider search for the GOP\u2019s identity that will shape the run-up to midterm races next year and weigh on the GOP\u2019s chances of fielding candidates capable of helping recapture Congress \u2013 a crucial consideration for Biden\u2019s presidency. Fundamentally, the fight that rips away at the Republican Party every day is the one ignited the moment that Trump declared his candidacy for president in 2015 and directed the GOP on a wild populist, nationalist ride. It has been exacerbated by a generation of pro-Trump figures inspired to run for Congress by his success. The choice before House Republicans was best captured by John Thune, one of several Senate Republicans who spoke up after their leader McConnell rejected Greene\u2019s \u201cloony lies and conspiracy theories\u201d as a \u201ccancer\u201d for the party. Thune argued Tuesday that \u201cthe House Republicans are going to have to decide who they want to be.\u201d \u201cDo they want to be the party of limited government and fiscal responsibility, free markets, peace through strength and pro-life, or do they want to be the party of conspiracy theories and QAnon, and I think that is the decision they\u2019ve got to face,\u201d Thune said. Another mainstream Republican, the party\u2019s 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney \u2013 who is now an outlier cut off by the Trumpian tide \u2013 also weighed in. \u201cI think our long history as a party has shown that it\u2019s important for us to separate ourselves from the people that are the wacky weeds,\u201d the Utah senator said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t, then our opposition tries to brand us with their image and with their point of view, which has been detrimental to any party that doesn\u2019t do that.\u201d The challenge for the broader Republican Party, however, is that there is plenty of evidence that the party\u2019s activist base is not excited by small government, debt reduction, globalization and a hawkish foreign policy \u2013 four pillars of the Republican Party for decades between Ronald Reagan and Trump. \u201cWe have to be aware that Marjorie Taylor Greene has a very wide following in this country,\u201d said Gabriel Sterling, one of the Republican electoral officials who stood firm against Trump\u2019s attempt to steal the election in Georgia. \u201cI mean, she\u2019s raised millions of dollars based on things that she said and sometimes \u2026 being attacked by the quote/unquote \u2018elites\u2019 only drives her up in terms of the esteem she\u2019s viewed by many, many people,\u201d Sterling told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on Tuesday. In many ways, this is a schism that the Republican Party in Washington has brought on itself, and that is already more destabilizing than the influxes of radical lawmakers brought into Washington by the Tea Party uprising and New Gingrich\u2019s Republican revolution that captured the House in 1994. Four years of appeasing Trump\u2019s uncouth character, unconstitutional power grabs and appeals to baser instincts \u2013 in a Faustian pact that returned a conservative Supreme Court \u2013 has effectively provided an entry path into the party for the extremists who found inspiration in the ex-President.   McConnell is turning against die hard Trumpists like Greene and Capitol Hill insurrectionists now. But his failure for weeks to condemn the ex-President\u2019s assaults on the integrity of the election helped brew the crazed atmosphere that Trump exploited when he incited the Capitol insurrection on January 6. The strength of the pro-Trump faction in the GOP \u2013 at a time when more traditional conservatives like McConnell would like to rid themselves of his influence \u2013 was underscored by the fact that a majority of House Republicans voted not to certify Biden\u2019s election win over election fraud lies. And even in the Senate, 45 Republicans \u2013 including McConnell \u2013 voted to support Sen. Rand Paul\u2019s attempt to have the impeachment trial that begins next week declared unconstitutional. The conundrum for the wider GOP is that the path to fundraising riches, fame and primary success lies in sponsorship from Trump. McCarthy\u2019s pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago to meet the ex-President last week shows that he believes his hope of winning the House lies closer to Greene\u2019s appeal than Cheney\u2019s. Senate Republicans however have long memories about past races squandered by extremist candidates. And Trump\u2019s style of politics just cost the party two runoff elections in Georgia that handed the Senate to Democrats. \u201cWhose side do I want to be on? Liz Cheney or Marjorie Taylor Greene?\u201d former Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who was himself driven out of the party because of his opposition to the Trump revolt, asked on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d with Wolf Blitzer, in encapsulating the electoral conundrum facing an increasingly ungovernable GOP. \u201cWhere do you think the party will likely grow more or where do I want to be as an elected official? It is pretty stark and that is what the party is facing right now.\u201d",

            "article_content": "GOP state senators in Georgia introduced a slate of bills on Monday that seek to roll back voter access in the state, such as \u201cno excuse\u201d absentee voting and automatic voter registration. If passed, the nine proposed measures \u2013 which follow elections where Democrats made historic gains in the state \u2013 could considerably reshape Georgia\u2019s electorate and have a significant impact on the 2022 midterm elections.  Republicans, echoing a baseless argument frequently made by former President Donald Trump, claim that the measures are necessary to prevent voter fraud, even though no evidence exists that it played a factor in the outcome of the 2020 election. One of the bills would require an excuse to vote absentee, undoing a 2005 Republican-backed law allowing no-excuse absentee voting. Under the bill, voters would need to be 75 years old or older, absent from their precinct, observing a religious holiday, have a physical disability, be required to provide constant care for someone with a physical disability, or required to work \u201cfor the protection of the health, life, or safety of the public during the entire time the polls are open\u201d to qualify to vote absentee. The bills would also ban ballot drop boxes and require voters to provide identification when they request an absentee ballot application. Another one of the bills would limit who can distribute absentee ballot applications to Georgia election officials and campaigns, blocking outside groups and nonprofit organizations from sending applications to voters. Other measures introduced by state Republican lawmakers would expand poll watcher access, prohibit new Georgia residents from voting in runoffs, and mandate monthly updates to election officials of voters who have died. Senate President Pro Tempore Butch Miller, who cosponsored the bills, said they \u201cvary in their approach for reasserting confidence in an election system which has lost credibility with a majority of Georgians.\u201d \u201cI want every legal vote counted, and I want better access for all voters. Accusing our reform efforts of suppression is a political tactic, pure and simple. Even those of us who never claimed that the election was stolen recognize that the electorate has lost confidence in the legitimacy of the system. We must work to restore that,\u201d he said in a statement to CNN. The package was roundly rebuked by Democratic lawmakers in the state after being introduced. \u201cHow pathetic is it to respond to election losses by changing election rules rather than changing course on policy and tone?\u201d state Democratic Rep. Josh McLaurin tweeted. His message was echoed by Democratic state Sen. Nikki Merritt, who tweeted, \u201cGA Republicans are so weak the only way they can win is by blocking your access to voting.\u201d Teri Anulewicz, a Democratic state representative, similarly tweeted: \u201cGood legislation rights a wrong. It fixes a problem. Voter suppression won\u2019t change why GA rejected the GOP in Nov & January.\u201d The Georgia Senate Democrats Twitter account also stated that the proposed measures are what happens when \u201cDemocrats win in GA.\u201d Analysis: False fraud claims fanned Capitol riot. Now they're fueling GOP efforts to restrict voting. \u201cThese bills introduced today by the GA Senate GOP are a laundry list of #votersupression tactics meant to roll back voter participation, aimed specifically at reversing the impact Black voters and other voters of color,\u201d the post read. Democrats won both of Georgia\u2019s US Senate seats in January runoff elections, and in November, President Joe Biden became the first Democrat to win the presidential election in the Peach State in nearly three decades. Despite the absence of any widespread security issues with voting nationwide, GOP lawmakers in battleground states across the country have pushed for additional voting restrictions. In Pennsylvania, Republicans are looking to repeal a no-excuse absentee voting law passed in 2019 through the state\u2019s GOP-led Legislature. And in Arizona, one GOP-sponsored bill would repeal the state\u2019s permanent early voting list, which allows a voter to automatically receive a ballot by mail for every election. This story has been updated with additional information. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the year no-excuse absentee voting was made law. It was 2005.

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump may be gone from the White House but his legacy of catastrophic mistrust is poisoning Washington, dimming hopes of a unified effort to crush the pandemic before mutant viral strains take root. Nine days after newly sworn-in President Joe Biden told America that \u201cevery disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war,\u201d recriminations between the parties and the Republican meltdown are consuming Congress.   It\u2019s now clear that the January 6 mob attack on Capitol Hill, while failing in its bid to reverse Trump\u2019s election loss, has utterly fractured the basic level of trust needed to make a political system function \u2014 at a critical national moment. In the quarter century of bitter political battles since former speaker Newt Gingrich\u2019s Republican revolution, Washington has never been this inflamed. At times on Thursday, it appeared that the whole of Congress was fixated on its own civil wars, cut off from behind its high iron fence from the reality of America\u2019s darkest modern winter. House Republicans who voted to impeach face backlash at home in test of Trump's staying power And with more than 432,000 Americans dead from Covid-19 and the economy in ruins, hopes are fading \u2013 amid the acrimony \u2013 of a bipartisan effort to beef up the crucial vaccine drive. The magnitude of that death toll has much to do with Trump\u2019s neglect when he was in office. The tumultuous forces now rocking Capitol Hill are, in most cases, linked to Trump or the extremism of his acolytes who have fully bought into his alternative reality that rejected truth and democracy itself. In an extraordinary comment on Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned of the enemy \u201cwithin\u201d in an apparent reference to some pro-Trump Republicans. \u201cWe have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress,\u201d Pelosi said. Given the urgency of getting every American \u2013 regardless of party \u2013 a vaccine before the pandemic mounts another deadly wave, it might have been expected that the Republican House leader would be locked in negotiations. But Kevin McCarthy was in Florida, paying homage to the ex-President, paving the way for Trump\u2019s political comeback and effectively launching the 2022 midterm election campaign. The make-up session means McCarthy is pinning his hopes of winning the House majority next year on the Trump base and an aggressive political effort by the former President. Far from being ostracized for trying to destroy democracy, Trump is yet again dictating its future. Trump is still a hero to his base, but since he just comprehensively lost a national election, McCarthy is taking a gamble. In the shorter term, his genuflection means that with the House GOP in thrall to the former President and his vengeful instincts, Republicans will be even less ready to work with Biden on critical efforts to respond to the pandemic. Adding to the sense of unchained uproar, the Republican Party is eating its own. Trump protege, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, flew to Wyoming Thursday to lead a revolt against No. 3 House Republican leader Liz Cheney, who \u2013 in a vote of conscience \u2013 voted to impeach the former President over the mob assault. It is extraordinary that the only senior Republican in danger of being toppled over the insurrection that has been forgotten or excused by many Republican leaders is Cheney, an authentic and lifelong conservative. Rank-and-file Democrats, meanwhile, are pushing an attempt to expel newly elected Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has supported the fringe conspiracy movement QAnon, following a report by CNN\u2019s KFile that before running for office she supported calls for the assassination of Democratic leaders on social media. Greene, a Georgia Republican, is an enthusiastic supporter of Trump and in a town hall meeting on Thursday night repeated lies that the election was stolen from the ex-President who has endorsed her several times. It's hard to expel a member of Congress. Here's what to know In another sign of the toxicity paralyzing Congress, House Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York lashed out at Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who had appeared to agree with her on the need for an investigation probing chaos on Wall Street. The New York Democrat, who has said she felt her life was in danger during the insurrection, tweeted that \u201cyou almost had me murdered.\u201d Just before a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, Cruz had objected to the certification of Arizona\u2019s electoral votes, embracing the baseless allegations from Trump of an improper election. The acidic mood in Congress is also caused by the chasm on whether to punish the ex-President for inciting the riot. Republican disinterest in holding the former President accountable for the insurrection in his impeachment trial starting next month is eroding the already tenuous effectiveness of the 50-50 Senate. And in a previously unthinkable suggestion, the acting chief of the Capitol Police proposed a permanent fence around the Capitol. Not even the terrorist attacks on September 11 led to proposals for such draconian security measures. The pandemonium on Capitol Hill contrasts with the methodical calm that now prevails at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue just over a week into Biden\u2019s presidency. The President doggedly pressed ahead with his effort to rollback Trump\u2019s political program on Thursday, signing an executive order that will expand access to Obamacare, the health care law Trump tried to destroy. Incredibly, given the circumstances, Biden still believes that he can get Republicans and Democrats on board with his pandemic rescue bill, though has signaled he may be ready to negotiate the $1.9 trillion price tag.   \u201cHe continues to believe that this can be \u2013 should be and will be a bipartisan bill \u2026 and he\u2019s having conversations with and listening to leaders and members of both parties to assure that we get to exactly that place,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. But there are increasing signs of impatience among Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, suggesting that time may be quickly running out for the new President to put a bipartisan veneer on the bill. \u201cWe want to work with our Republican colleagues to advance this legislation in bipartisan way, but the work must move forward, preferably with our Republican colleagues, but without them if we must,\u201d Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said. Pelosi also signaled that she was ready to use a procedural device known as reconciliation to swiftly pass a bill to boost vaccine supplies, alleviate the housing crisis and extend unemployment benefits if Republicans didn\u2019t sign on. The President has announced an ambitious bid to completely overhaul the faltering vaccine distribution effort left over by the previous administration. But the plan is contingent on a huge boost in funding that only Congress can provide. While hospitalizations and new cases of Covid-19 have fallen across the country, the baseline is still highly elevated. Many medical experts are concerned that mutations of the virus that are more transmissible, slightly more deadly and may be more resistant to vaccines could soon become dominant and trigger another wave of sickness and death. Two cases of one of those variants, first detected in South Africa, were found in South Carolina, officials said Thursday. The discovery was so worrying because Biden said this week that it will be the end of the summer before all Americans get the vaccine. Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota and an informal adviser to Biden\u2019s coronavirus team, warned of \u201cthe darkest of days ahead.\u201d \u201cWhat we can expect to see in the course of the next, I think, six to 14 weeks, is something that we haven\u2019t even come close to experiencing yet,\u201d Osterholm said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d That\u2019s not a message that is breaking through on Capitol Hill.",

            "article_content": "Seven Senate Democrats filed an ethics complaint on Thursday against Republican Sens. Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas and called for the Ethics Committee to investigate how their objections to the Electoral College votes on January 6 may have contributed to inciting the violent Capitol insurrection. \u201cThe Senate Ethics Committee should open an investigation into the actions of Senators Hawley and Cruz, and perhaps others as investigation may reveal, in order to protect the integrity, safety, and reputation of the Senate,\u201d Democratic Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Ron Wyden of Oregon, Tina Smith of Minnesota, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio wrote in the complaint. \u201cThe question the Senate must answer is not whether Senators Hawley and Cruz had the right to the object to the electors, but whether the senators failed to \u2018[p]ut loyalty to the highest moral principles and to country above loyalty to persons, party, or Government department\u2019 or engaged in \u2018improper conduct reflecting on the Senate\u2019 in connection with the violence on January 6,\u201d the Democrats wrote, citing the Code of Ethics for Government Service and the Senate Ethics Manual. In their letter to the panel\u2019s leaders, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware and Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma, the seven senators also asked the committee to offer disciplinary recommendations, \u201cincluding up to expulsion or censure.\u201d In a statement Thursday, Hawley called the complaint \u201ca flagrant abuse of the Senate ethics process and a flagrant attempt to exact partisan revenge.\u201d \u201cDemocrats appear intent on weaponizing every tool at their disposal \u2014 including pushing an unconstitutional impeachment process \u2014 to further divide the country,\u201d the Missouri Republican said, referring to the House\u2019s impeachment of then-President Donald Trump earlier this month, which will next go to the Senate. A spokesperson for Cruz accused the seven Democrats of \u201cplaying political games by filing frivolous ethics complaints against their colleagues.\u201d \u201cSen. Cruz debated a question of law and policy on the floor of the Senate, he did so expressly supported by 11 other Senators, and he utilized a process to raise the objection that has been explicitly authorized by federal law for nearly 150 years,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement, adding that \u201cCruz immediately condemned the January 6th terrorist attack on the Capitol, calling for everyone who stormed the Capitol to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d The complaint comes as authorities are investigating hundreds of people in connection with the deadly pro-Trump riot at the US Capitol, including possible links to high-ranking Republicans who encouraged them. Federal prosecutors said earlier this month that they are looking at everyone involved in the riot, including the role Trump played in inciting it. District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine warned Sunday that Trump could possibly be charged by city prosecutors with \u201ca misdemeanor, a six-month-in-jail maximum,\u201d amid fallout from the insurrection. Hawley announced on December 30 that he would object during the Electoral College certification process, defying Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. Nearly a dozen other Republican lawmakers, including Cruz, later announced that they, too, would object. But some changed their minds after the midday violence on January 6 \u2013 which is something the seven Democrats noted in their complaint. \u201cBy proceeding with their objections to the electors after the violent attack, Senators Cruz and Hawley lent legitimacy to the mob\u2019s cause and made future violence more likely,\u201d the Democratic senators wrote. The seven Democrats wrote Thursday that \u201cThe Senate has the exclusive power to determine whether (Hawley\u2019s and Cruz\u2019s) actions violated its ethics rules, to investigate further conduct of which we may not be aware that may have violated these rules, and to consider appropriate discipline.\u201d They urged investigators to probe issues including whether Hawley, Cruz or members of their offices or campaigns \u201cwere in contact or coordinated with the organizers of the rally,\u201d \u201cknew about the plans for the event\u201d or \u201creceived funding from organizations or donors that also funded the rally.\u201d Whitehouse, one of the seven Democrats, told CNN on Thursday afternoon that he sent the letter because \u201cwe need to clear up exactly what happened.\u201d \u201cThe only place to get that done effectively is in the Senate, because you can\u2019t trust executive branch agencies to do that investigation because they\u2019re on the wrong side of the separation of powers,\u201d he added. Hawley, who is thought to harbor 2024 presidential ambitions, has borne the brunt of the blame for kicking off the actions that led to thousands of Trump supporters storming the Capitol complex and forcing the House and Senate to go into emergency lockdown. Hawley had offered pro-Trump demonstrators who stood outside the Capitol a raised-fist salute as he walked into the Senate early that day. Publishing house Simon & Schuster dropped his upcoming book, which will now be released by conservative publisher Regnery Publishing. Several major companies, including Blue Cross Blue Shield and Citigroup, announced they were halting donations to Hawley and other Republicans who objected to the Electoral College votes. Luxury hotel chain Loews Hotel Group has since canceled a fundraiser for Hawley, saying it\u2019s opposed to \u201call who supported and incited\u201d the deadly riot at the Capitol. The complaint from the Democratic senators also quotes Missouri\u2019s former Sen. John Danforth, Hawley\u2019s onetime mentor, who told The New York Times that \u201clending credence to Trump\u2019s false claim that the election was stolen is a highly destructive attack on our constitutional government.\u201d Danforth, whose support was central to Hawley winning his 2018 Republican primary, called supporting him \u201cthe worst mistake I ever made in my life\u201d earlier this month.

            "article_content": "Prosecutors on Tuesday filed the first significant conspiracy charge in the US Capitol attack, alleging that three members of the so-called Oath Keepers, an extremist militant group, planned and coordinated ahead of the January 6 assault. In an amended complaint unsealed Tuesday in federal court, an FBI agent divulged striking new details about the group\u2019s efforts. Jessica Watkins, the alleged founder of an Ohio militia, had instructions to make explosives out of bleach printed out at her home, according to the court document. Chilling messages sent between the militants during the siege that are quoted in the complaint appear to indicate they were searching for lawmakers inside the building as they sought to stop Congress from certifying the presidential election. Capitol riot investigators narrow in on extremist groups and military-style coordination While at the Capitol, one alleged member of the conspiracy, Thomas Edward Caldwell, allegedly received a Facebook message reading \u201cAll members are in the tunnels under capital seal them in. Turn on gas.\u201d In subsequent messages, an unidentified person appeared to give Caldwell directions inside the labyrinthian government building: \u201cTom all legislators are down in the Tunnels 3floors down\u201d one says. \u201cGo through back house chamber doors facing N left down hallway down steps,\u201d says another, according to court documents. Watkins turned herself into local police in the state on Sunday along with Donovan Crowl, another member of the Ohio group accused in the conspiracy charges. The pair, along with Caldwell, are accused of moving together \u201cin an organized and practiced fashion\u201d as they pushed through a crowd towards a door to the Capitol building, according to a charging document. The three were part of a group of eight to 10 people all wearing paramilitary gear and Oath Keeper paraphernalia, signifying their affiliation with the self-styled militia that\u2019s driven by anti-government conspiracies, according to an FBI affidavit. (The Ohio militia founded by Watkins pays dues to the Oath Keepers, according to the affidavit.) How Parler is trying to get back online Individual charges against the three had been revealed in recent days but the new conspiracy charge grouping them together represents the most serious allegation of coordinated activity at the riot made by prosecutors investigating the events of the insurrection. Prosecutors have called Caldwell an apparent leader of the Oath Keepers, and had previously charged him alone with conspiracy. (Oath Keepers leader Steward Rhodes denied that to CNN.) It\u2019s not clear who is representing Watkins and Donovan on the charges. Caldwell was arrested in Virginia earlier Tuesday and at an initial appearance in federal court in Harrisonburg, Virginia, Tuesday afternoon, a federal magistrate judge ordered that he remain in jail as he awaits trial. \u201cThe conduct and statements of Mr. Caldwell and the others, it really is just pure lawlessness,\u201d Judge Joel Hoppe of the Western District of Virginia said. Prosecutors said at the hearing that Caldwell could face more charges, potentially including federal riot and sedition charges. He currently faces charges of obstruction of a federal proceeding, destruction of federal property and two conspiracy counts that carry serious possible penalties. Caldwell\u2019s defense lawyer argued that he should be released because he is at risk of contracting Covid-19 in detention, his charges are not that serious and that he is a retired Navy captain who served the country and was honorably discharged. Caldwell said in court he still receives retirement payments from the Navy. \u201cSeventy percent of Republicans believe that the election was fraudulent,\u201d his temporarily appointed defense lawyer said, adding that Caldwell\u2019s opposition to the government wasn\u2019t out of the ordinary for \u201cblustering on Facebook.\u201d According to a recording of walkie-talkie-like communications that the militant group members were allegedly having during the riot, Watkins said that she was part of a team of 30 to 40 people. \u201cWe have a good group. We have about 30-40 of us. We are sticking together and sticking to the plan,\u201d Watkins said, according to the affidavit. 12 Army National Guard members removed from inauguration duty At another point in the recording, after Watkins reports to the group that unknown others were \u201cthrowing grenades\u201d and \u201cshooting people with paint balls,\u201d a man responds to her telling her to be safe and adding, \u201cGet it, Jess. Do your F**king thing. This is what we f**king [unintelligible] up for. Everything we f**king trained for.\u201d In an interview, Crowl\u2019s mother, Teresa Joann Rowe, said her son, who previously served in the US Marine Corps, has expressed increasingly hostile political views in recent years. \u201cIt felt like he did a 180-degree turnaround, felt like the world owed him a living and had a big chip on his shoulder,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it\u2019s because life didn\u2019t go the way he planned.\u201d Asked why she thinks Crowl may have been joined to this extremist group, she said, \u201cI would like to understand myself. I don\u2019t get it.\u201d She said Crowl served in the Marine Corps for about six years starting in the late 1980\u2019s and in recent years has done \u201codd jobs, being paid under the table so that he doesn\u2019t have to pay taxes.\u201d She said prior to the news surrounding the storming of the Capitol, she was unaware of Crowl\u2019s involvement in any political groups, though she had heard him express pro-Donald Trump political views. She also said she recalled Crowl stating that \u201cthey were going to overtake the government if they\u2026 tried to take Trump\u2019s presidency from him. So he did make that statement, but that was two or three years ago so I forgot all about it.\u201d Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, said he\u2019s concerned some of those arrested have US military backgrounds. \u201cSome right-wing extremist groups, particularly the anti-government Oath Keepers, have a long history of recruiting from current and former members of the military and law enforcement,\u201d Segal told CNN. \u201cOath Keepers are part of the resurgent militia movement, which believes the federal government has been co-opted by a shadowy conspiracy that is trying to strip American citizens of their rights. Though the Oath Keepers will accept anyone as members, what differentiates them from other anti-government extremist groups is their explicit focus on recruiting current and former military, law enforcement and first responder personnel,\u201d he added.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump ends his tumultuous presidency with the nation confronting the greatest strain to its fundamental cohesion since the Civil War. The January 6 assault on the US Capitol capped four years in which Trump relentlessly stoked the nation\u2019s divisions and simultaneously provided oxygen for the growth of White nationalist extremism through his open embrace of racist language and conspiracy theories. In the process, Trump has not only shattered the barriers between the Republican Party and far-right extremists but also enormously intensified a trend that predated him: a growing willingness inside the GOP\u2019s mainstream to employ anti-small-d-democratic means to maintain power in a country demographically evolving away from the party. The result has been to raise the stakes in the ideological polarization of the parties that has been reshaping American politics for decades. Particularly since the 1990s, the parties have steadily pulled apart, with Republicans rallying the voters who are most uneasy with the way America is changing demographically, culturally and economically and Democrats mobilizing those most comfortable with the changes. The Trump presidency, especially its chaotic final months, has shown that both the leaders and rank-and-file voters of the parties are now divided not only by their policy preferences but also by their assessments of the nation\u2019s underlying realities, and even their commitment to the traditional norms of democracy. In one sense, the two parties are moving away from each other in mirror image: Vast majorities of voters in each party now say in polls that they view the other side as a threat to the nation\u2019s future. But that assessment is provoking a more extreme reaction inside the GOP than among Democrats, as different elements of the Republican coalition have embraced a succession of anti-democratic actions culminating in the widespread support among GOP elected officials for Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert the November election and in last week\u2019s unprecedented assault on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob. False fraud claims fanned Capitol riot. Now they're fueling GOP efforts to restrict voting. All of this is unfolding against the backdrop of a pandemic that has staggered the economy, plunged millions of families into financial peril, overwhelmed America\u2019s health care system and widened the nation\u2019s political divisions \u2013 as Republican-leaning jurisdictions, partly because of pressure from Trump, have resisted the measures, like masking, that public health professionals consider crucial. Coalescing at the transition point between the presidencies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, these pressures have produced a level of internal division and cracks in the constitutional order that most experts agree exceeds even the unrest of the 1960s \u2013 and probably has only one full parallel in American history. \u201cIt is pretty clear that this is the worst since the Civil War, and I say that without difficulty,\u201d says Princeton University historian Sean Wilentz, the author of \u201cThe Rise of American Democracy,\u201d a monumental history of America\u2019s development in the 19th century. \u201cAnd on top of that, what happened on the 6th was the saddest day for American democracy since April 12, 1861.\u201d That was the day Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, beginning the Civil War. Few experts anticipate a reprise of that experience: a formal attempt at dissolving the nation accompanied by widespread armed conflict (even if they aren\u2019t quite as quick to dismiss the possibility as a few years ago). For one thing, today\u2019s lines of political conflict wouldn\u2019t allow as neat a division as the sectional North-South split over slavery in the Civil War: Our modern Mason-Dixon line separates Democratic-leaning metropolitan centers from red rural and small-town areas in every state, an impractical pattern for any actual separation. Susan Stokes, a political scientist who directs the Chicago Center on Democracy at the University of Chicago, notes that civil wars typically also require a split in the armed forces or the emergence of a full-scale rebel army, dynamics not yet evident in America. And Stokes, Wilentz and others point out that, for all of the pressure Trump imposed, the November 3 election and its aftermath demonstrated enormous resiliency in our political system, with voter turnout soaring to a record level despite the pandemic and courts and local election officials \u2013 including Republicans in each case \u2013 rejecting the President\u2019s groundless claims of fraud. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget we had the largest national election in American history amid the pandemic and it went off without a hitch,\u201d says Wilentz. \u201cNovember 3 was a day that will not in infamy but will live in fame for the exercise of democracy, and we ought not to forget that. There\u2019s a lot of strength in the system.\u201d I think we are a long way from choose your outright civil war: We\u2019re not Yugoslavia; we\u2019re not Spain. But we are definitely in danger of a kind of a lower-level violence, decentralized because that\u2019s our country\u2019s middle name, constant outbreaks, for years to come. Susan Stokes, director, Chicago Center on Democracy, University of Chicago To most experts, all of these mitigating factors make it extremely unlikely that America will follow the path of modern countries that collapsed into full-on civil war, like Yugoslavia after communism, Spain before World War II or Latin American nations during the 1980s. But a few years ago, those comparisons would have been unthinkable, and raising them now, even to dismiss them, underscores the fractures in our political structure. \u201cI think we are a long way from choose your outright civil war: We\u2019re not Yugoslavia; we\u2019re not Spain,\u201d says Stokes. \u201cBut we are definitely in danger of a kind of a lower-level violence, decentralized because that\u2019s our country\u2019s middle name, constant outbreaks, for years to come.\u201d These pressures emerge from the convergence of two tectonic developments in American politics, one long-gestating, the other more recent. The longer-term process is the ideological separation of the two parties, a process that I called \u201cthe great sorting out\u201d in my 2007 book, \u201cThe Second Civil War.\u201d For most of American history, our political parties have been ramshackle coalitions of disparate ideological views. But starting in the 1960s, and accelerating since the 1990s, conservatives (especially Southern evangelical Whites and Northern working-class Whites) have migrated out of the Democratic Party, while moderates and liberals (especially college-educated Whites and secular voters) have migrated out of the Republican coalition. This process has both encouraged \u2013 and been accelerated by \u2013 the development of overtly partisan media since the 1980s, which has allowed voters on each side to retreat from a shared set of understandings about the nation\u2019s condition. The rise of social media in this century has only intensified the withdrawal from shared experience. Trump moves to lift some Covid-19-related travel restrictions, but Biden plans to block the order All of this has narrowed the differences within each party\u2019s coalition but widened the distance between them. Both among elected officials and voters, a huge chasm now separates the parties on almost all major issues. The distance is especially foreboding on attitudes toward the big structural changes remaking American life, culturally, demographically and economically. Republicans now dominate among the voters who polls show are most uneasy about those changes \u2013 particularly Whites who are non-urban, identify as evangelical Christians or lack college degrees. In recent polling by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute, a larger share of Republicans say Whites and Christians face significant discrimination than say the same about Blacks and Hispanics; more than three-fourths of Republicans say the values of Islam are incompatible with American values; three-fifths say American society punishes men just for acting like men; and nearly three-fifths agree with the harshly worded statement that \u201cimmigrants are invading our country and replacing our cultural and ethnic background.\u201d Democrats in the poll were far less likely to agree with any of those propositions. That reflects the composition of their competing coalition, which revolves around the groups generally most comfortable with the emerging America: people of color, young people, secular adults who don\u2019t identify with any religious tradition, and college-educated White voters, particularly women. This demographic divide has widened the geographic separation between the parties. The GOP has been virtually exiled from the fast-growing metro areas that are driving population growth and economic dynamism: While George H.W. Bush won 57 of the nation\u2019s 100 largest counties as recently as 1988, Trump carried just 9 of the 100 largest in November, struggling not only in heavily minority central cities but also in prosperous, well-educated inner suburbs. Simultaneously, the GOP has solidified its control of the nation\u2019s more uniformly White exurban, small-town and rural regions: While Bill Clinton won about half of the nation\u2019s counties in his 1992 and 1996 presidential wins, Biden carried only about one-sixth of American counties, even while comfortably winning the popular vote. In Congress, these hardening lines of division have made it much more difficult for presidents in either party to secure meaningful cooperation from the other; the parties now vote in lockstep against each other much more routinely than in earlier generations. At the grassroots level, this separation has seeded rising reciprocal antagonism. In the Public Religion Research Institute polling, about four-fifths of Democrats say the Republican Party has been taken over by racists, while a virtually identical share of Republicans say the Democratic Party has been taken over by socialists. Pew polling before the election found that an even higher percentage \u2013 roughly 9-in-10 on each side \u2013 said that if the other party\u2019s presidential candidate won in November, it would produce \u201clasting harm\u201d to the nation. Trumps' snub of Bidens historic in its magnitude This is an unusually pitched level of political antagonism, and it has unquestionably made it more difficult for Washington to make progress on big problems. But as Wilentz notes, in a country as diverse as America, \u201cthere are always tons of divisions.\u201d And while those divisions have contributed to dysfunction in Congress, they had not until recently raised real questions about America\u2019s underlying political stability. Those doubts have emerged only since the long-standing polarization of the parties has been reinforced by a more recent second factor: the increasing willingness of the Republican Party to employ extreme and anti-democratic tactics to maintain power.   This pattern has gathered momentum for years but it\u2019s tremendously accelerated since Trump\u2019s emergence as the party\u2019s leader. Signposts of this shift have come steadily over the past decade: the wave of voter identification and other laws in Republican states making it tougher to vote after the GOP\u2019s gains in the 2010 election; the 2013 party-line Shelby County decision by Republican appointees on the Supreme Court to gut the Voting Rights Act; Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s unprecedented machinations in 2016 to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a Supreme Court justice who would have tipped the majority to liberals; and the congressional Republican acquiescence to Trump\u2019s regular threats to the rule of law, from openly extorting the government of Ukraine to manufacture dirt on Biden to attempting, for the first time in American history, to tilt the census results to the advantage of one party. The widespread Republican support for Trump\u2019s efforts to steal the election \u2013 which persisted to the point of a majority of House Republicans voting to overturn the results even after the mob of his supporters ransacked the Capitol \u2013 has placed a dramatic exclamation point on this retreat from democracy in the GOP, many experts agree. \u201cFifty years from now when people read about [this era] they are not going to say there were two parties that were small-d democratic,\u201d says Stokes. \u201cThey are going to say that this is a political party that was captured by autocrats, by not-democratic people.\u201d To Stokes, the Republican focus on alleged fraud in the 2020 election \u201cis sort of a big distraction\u201d from the underlying change that\u2019s reshaping the party. While the mass of Trump followers might accept his allegations of fraud, she notes, those claims have been disproved so thoroughly it\u2019s hard to imagine that they are believed by many of the party leaders joining his efforts to overturn the election. And that points to a deeper, and darker, meaning for the post-election maneuvering among Republican senators, House members and state attorneys general to subvert the results. \u201cPretty clearly they are not really democrats,\u201d she says, referring to believers in democracy, not the opposing political party. \u201cThey are people who think they should win no matter what. I almost want to say to them: Why don\u2019t you have the courage of your convictions and explain to us why the United States should not be a democracy now? Because what they are really saying is that no matter what happens, Trump needs to stay in power.\u201d   These efforts have found widespread support among Republican voters, with three-fourths or more of them routinely telling pollsters they believe the election was stolen and a majority in last week\u2019s ABC/Washington Post survey saying GOP leaders should have done even more to try to overturn the result. Those attitudes bring to a point years of surveys showing a retreat from democratic values in a significant portion of the GOP base. In one recent Public Religion Research Institute study, for instance, nearly three-fifths of Republicans agreed that \u201cbecause things have gotten so far off track in this country, we need a leader who is willing to break some rules if that\u2019s what it takes to set things right.\u201d In another national survey organized by political scientist Larry Bartels, a majority of Republican voters agreed \u201cthe traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\u201d Imagine if the Weathermen had had a caucus of 10 Democrats in the House who basically supported them and they in turn were allied with state Democratic parties all over the place, state legislators, etc., and so on. That would have been a political danger of a different order. Todd Gitlin, Columbia University sociologist Many analysts believe these attitudes are inextricably linked to the anxieties about demographic and cultural change evident among GOP voters in the polling by the Public Religion Research Institute and others: At its core, the fear of demographic eclipse is eroding the commitment to democracy among both leaders and followers in the Republican Party. As Bartels, now at Vanderbilt University, noted in his paper, \u201cThe strongest predictor by far of these antidemocratic attitudes is ethnic antagonism\u2014especially concerns about the political power and claims on government resources of immigrants, African-Americans, and Latinos.\u201d Republicans have lost the popular vote in seven of the past eight presidential elections, something no party had done since the formation of the modern party system in 1828. And, according to calculations by Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, a centrist think tank, if you allocate half of each state\u2019s population to each senator, GOP senators have represented a majority of the population only once in the past 40 years despite controlling the actual Senate majority about half of that time. (Today Republicans hold exactly half the Senate seats while representing only about 44% of the population, Drutman calculates.) The determination to continue exercising majority power while attracting support from only a minority of the population, many experts agree, is the force that has pushed Republicans to retreat step by step from small d-democratic traditions \u2013 a trend raised to a visceral extreme by the literal assault on the Capitol, a core symbol of American democracy. The widespread inroads into the GOP among the forces hostile to democratic traditions mark a key difference from the 1960s, another period of intense social discord. While America in that era also experienced enormous strain \u2013 with massive protest movements, large-scale urban unrest and riots, and anti-war radicals who regularly set off bombs at military recruiting or corporate offices \u2013 the radical elements on that continuum never achieved as much influence inside the Democratic Party as the Trump forces skeptical of democracy have established in the modern GOP. Columbia University sociologist Todd Gitlin, who participated in the student left during the 1960s and has written one of the definitive histories of the period, notes that while \u201cthere were a lot of bombs, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d radicals such as the Weathermen group \u201cwere never a threat\u201d to the nation\u2019s core institutions because they lacked any leverage within the political system. \u201cImagine if the Weathermen had had a caucus of 10 Democrats in the House who basically supported them and they in turn were allied with state Democratic parties all over the place, state legislators, etc., and so on. That would have been a political danger of a different order,\u201d he says. Instead, he says, the Weathermen and other militant groups such as the Black Panthers \u201cwere not politically central in the way that [today\u2019s extremists] are. There is now a party made up substantially of people who are either friendly toward violence \u2026 or willing to look the other way. And nobody was willing to look the other way at those bombings.\u201d The closest American parallel to the violence unleased by Trump supporters at the Capitol \u2013 and earlier threats like the armed protests against Covid restrictions and the subsequent plot to kidnap Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan \u2013 may be the pro-slavery Democratic Party around the Civil War. Especially after the conflict, White racists across the South employed a massive campaign of violence to undermine the biracial Reconstruction governments and prevent the former slaves from exercising their new freedoms, including the right to vote. That bitter and bloody tradition lingered through nearly a full century of lynchings and other violence to deny the vote and civil rights to Blacks across the Jim Crow South \u2013 all with the support of the Dixiecrat Southern Democrats. Seen against that history, the upsurge in White nationalist violence under Trump seems less like a new phenomenon than the resurgence of an old one \u2013 a determination to use force to maintain a clear racial hierarchy. Political scientist Alvin Tillery, director of the Center for the Study of Diversity and Democracy at Northwestern University, says Trump\u2019s success at mobilizing an electoral coalition resistant to demographic change underscores the country\u2019s imperfect progress toward creating a true multiracial democracy. While America has formally been a democracy since its birth in the 1700s, he notes, for most of our history those democratic rights were limited solely to White men. Democracy, he says, is much easier to sustain when it\u2019s limited to \u201ca master race \u2026 where your skin color or your gender determined your rights and your status.\u201d Only since the 1960s, with the passage of the Voting Rights Act and immigration revisions that led to a rapid growth in the nation\u2019s racial diversity, did \u201cwe really start trying, with much great difficulty, to be a multiracial, gender-equitable LGBTQ-plus tolerant democracy. That\u2019s why we have these struggles.\u201d Few are willing to hazard definitive predictions about whether America will pull back from this brink and restore more stability to the political system \u2013 or spiral further into conflict and division. Biden, who will assume the presidency Wednesday, appears to be betting primarily on a strategy of narrowing divisions by providing bread-and-butter improvements in people\u2019s daily lives: more vaccine shots in their arms, more Covid relief money in their pockets \u2013 while stepping up law enforcement efforts against White nationalist groups. That approach might help contain the problem, but most experts agree it is unlikely to end it. While the inclination among Democrats may be \u201clet\u2019s just get to the bread-and-butter issue,\u201d says Tillery, \u201cthat\u2019s not necessarily the motivation of the people that sacked the Capitol.\u201d Biden crafts inaugural address to unify a country in crisis In the long run, whatever Biden and other Democrats do, the question of whether the US faces more violence and other threats to its fundamental political stability probably rests more with the choices that Republicans make. If the party continues to validate and welcome extremists at its fringe and move further toward adopting anti-democratic tactics in its mainstream, the nation could be locked into a cycle of rising disorder \u2013 particularly because the growing racial and religious diversity that triggers so much of the alienation in the Republican coalition will only intensify in the years ahead. Wilentz notes there has always been a minority of Americans who embrace conspiracy theories, tolerate violence to advance their goals and are willing to ditch democracy to maintain power for their side. But for much of American history, their influence has been controlled because neither party would fully embrace their causes; that\u2019s the barrier that has cracked in the GOP, especially during the tempestuous Trump years. \u201cThat 35% has always been there, let alone the really crackpot 15%,\u201d Wilentz says. \u201cThe point is they were contained because both parties respected each other and respected what political representative democracy was all about. The Republican Party forgot to do that. The Republican Party stopped doing that. And that is what unleashed this force.\u201d However hard Biden tries, history suggests that one party alone is unlikely to repair the widening domestic divisions that may stand as Trump\u2019s clearest legacy. It\u2019s likely that both parties will need to commit to undoing Trump\u2019s damage to America\u2019s political stability \u2013 or that damage won\u2019t be undone at all.",

            "article_content": "A President who has repeatedly touted himself as pro-law enforcement is now being accused of fueling a growing threat of extremists that has law enforcement officials across the nation on high alert. As the presidency of Donald Trump draws to an end, the recent Trump-inspired attacks on law enforcement officers, his refusal to take the steps necessary to defuse violent elements of his base and the President\u2019s years-long assault on agencies such as the FBI and Justice Department, are all casting serious doubt on the sincerity of his self-described support for those who wear the badge. Trump's final full week in office ends with the nation in disarray On January 6, the nation watched with horror as a mob of pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol Building following a rally near the White House. The deadly attack was in part the result of Trump\u2019s efforts to whip up fear and anger among his base with false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. Among the five people who died in the attack was a US Capitol Police officer who had been attempting to defend the building. Eyewitness video from the insurgence shows numerous rioters assaulting law enforcement officers, including gruesome images of a Metropolitan Police Department officer being crushed in a doorway as he screamed in agony. Trump was silent for much of the day, offering tepid condemnation of his supporters who committed violence against police in his name. The President later released a stronger video denouncing the incident, but sources told CNN that Trump later appeared to regret making the video. In addition to the recent violence against law enforcement officers at the Capitol by Trump supporters, intelligence officials suggest the mob attack did not happen in a vacuum. According to a US intelligence bulletin obtained by CNN, extremists view the domestic terrorist attack by the pro-Trump mob as a success and a motivator to conduct future violence. Just as troubling, the intelligence bulletin indicated that many of the extremists\u2019 grievances that could fuel follow-on attacks against government and law enforcement officials closely mirror the baseless claims frequently repeated by Trump. For example, FBI and Department of Homeland Security intelligence analysts said conspiracy theories such as the existence of a \u201cdeep state\u201d in government, as well as the baseless belief among extremists that mass voter fraud tipped the 2020 presidential election in Biden\u2019s favor, are fueling domestic extremists. Although Trump has enjoyed widespread support from police unions in the run up to the 2020 election, even law enforcement organizations that endorsed him for reelection \u2013 such as the powerful Fraternal Order of Police \u2013 were appalled at the Trump-fueled January 6 attack on the Capitol. In a strongly worded statement imploring the President to speak out against the Capitol violence, the group said, \u201cthe images coming in from the United State Capitol Building today are heartbreaking to every American. We call on President Trump to forcefully urge these demonstrators to stop their unlawful activity, to stand down, and to disperse.\u201d Trump finishes with worst first term approval rating ever The recent Trump-inspired assault on police officers is not the only controversial period Trump has faced when it came to his relationship with law enforcement. While addressing a group of police officers early in his presidency, Trump encouraged those in attendance to be \u201crough\u201d with suspects. \u201cWhen you see these thugs being thrown into the back of a paddy wagon. You see them thrown in rough,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cPlease don\u2019t be too nice.\u201d The President\u2019s comments praising the excessive use of force were met with widespread condemnation by some law enforcement agencies, including the head of the New York City Police Department, who said that to \u201csuggest that police officers apply any standard in the use of force other than what is reasonable and necessary is irresponsible, unprofessional and sends the wrong message to law enforcement as well as the public.\u201d The Gainesville, Florida, police department said Trump had \u201cno business endorsing or condoning cops being rough with arrestees and suggesting that we should slam their heads onto the car while putting them in.\u201d The department added that Trump\u2019s remarks \u201cset modern policing back and erased a lot of the strides we have made to build trust in our community.\u201d Terrifying scope of Capitol attack becoming clearer as Washington locks down for Biden's inauguration Perhaps Trump\u2019s most notorious contradiction in his alleged full-throated support for law enforcement was his endless clashing with agencies such as the FBI and Justice Department as they worked to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election. Launched in July 2016, the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, code named Crossfire Hurricane, probed four members of Trump\u2019s campaign and their suspected ties to the Kremlin, and was frequently the target of Trump\u2019s ire. The investigation was later taken over by veteran prosecutor Robert Mueller, whom Trump constantly attacked and worked to undermine throughout the course of the investigation. One of the subjects of the investigation, retired Lt. General Michael Flynn, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his dealings with the Russians and was fired from his position as Trump\u2019s national security adviser. Trump later pardoned Flynn, claiming without evidence that Flynn was a victim in an attempt by federal investigators to undermine the Trump presidency. Two other Trump allies, Roger Stone and Paul Manafort, were similarly pardoned by Trump after they were convicted of committing federal crimes. Similar to the Flynn pardon, Trump blasted the federal law enforcement officers who investigated Stone and Manafort, calling them corrupt and partisan. Trump\u2019s caustic comments about the investigators working to uncover Russian influence stood at odds with his attempted \u201cpro-law enforcement\u201d image, as did comments made by the President\u2019s attorney, Rudy Giuliani, when he compared career FBI agents to murderous Nazis. Pentagon authorizes 25,000 National Guard members for inauguration With less than a week remaining as president, Trump\u2019s ceaseless false claims of mass voter fraud continue to threaten and make life more difficult for law enforcement in America. As the nation prepares to inaugurate Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States, federal law enforcement agencies have transformed the nation\u2019s capital into a veritable fortress \u2013 fearful that pro-Trump supporters could stage an attack along the lines of the Trump-inspired violent insurgence at the US Capitol on January 6. FBI field offices across the nation are spinning up command posts to monitor potential violence in their regions by those who believe Trump\u2019s lies about the 2020 election results, and in places such as Michigan, law enforcement officers across the state are being mobilized to protect life and property. The potential threats on the horizon place America\u2019s law enforcement officers squarely in harm\u2019s way. And with Trump still refusing to accept the legitimacy of the election and forcefully tell his supporters to back down, police in America remain on high alert, and potential targets for more Trump-inspired violence.",

            "article_content": "There is growing concern about security on Capitol Hill, as well as worries from lawmakers facing threats to their personal safety, law enforcement sources and members of Congress tell CNN. Some members of Congress have told their party leadership that they are in fear for their lives and the lives of their families, sources told CNN. And multiple members of Congress have taken new security measures, sources tell CNN. The more they learn in news reports and online, the more concerned they grow, several sources said. There\u2019s a growing realization about the danger they were in, the sources said, especially when they see videos that reflect how coordinated the attack seemed at times. One video of particular concern shows militia members with their arms on each other\u2019s shoulders, pushing each other in a line that snakes through a crowd surging against a door into the Capitol building, one congressional source told CNN. Rep. Peter Meijer, a freshman Republican from Michigan said on CNN Wednesday he was afraid of the threats he was going to face for being one of 10 Republicans to break ranks and vote to impeach Trump. \u201cI am,\u201d Meijer said on CNN when asked if he was afraid of threats being made against him. \u201cBut I am not going to let that sway my decision. I think if we give the assassins veto, if we give the insurrectionists veto, we lose something in this country, and I won\u2019t let that happen again.\u201d Meijer has since added that he plans to buy body armor and was adjusting his daily routines to protect himself from death threats. \u201cIt\u2019s sad that we have to get to that point, but you know, our expectation is that someone may try to kill us,\u201d Meijer said Thursday on MSNBC. Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota told PBS NewsHour on Wednesday that he had \u201cabsolutely\u201d received threats against his life from Trump supporters prior to the impeachment vote pressuring him to vote in favor of the President after he voted to certify the 2020 presidential election results for Joe Biden. Johnson did not vote to impeach Trump. \u201cI mean just today, just this morning, one of my offices received a threat against my life. I\u2019ve received other threats against my safety. My address, a picture of my home where my family lives was posted on kind of an anti-Dusty Facebook page. These are dark times. There is a tremendous amount of outrage and rage\u201d Johnson told PBS Wednesday. \u201cThe reality is, I think not just me but all of my colleagues, we need to acknowledge we may well be in danger, but we still need to do our jobs.\u201d Johnson said the threats so far are coming from supporters of President Donald Trump so far. \u201cIn the last week, a preponderance of the threats have come from those on the extreme far right,\u201d acknowledging that in the past he has received threats from the left. Projecting safety concerns about the upcoming inauguration, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn told CNN Wednesday that while he felt safe being at the Capitol that day, he was unsure about how safe he would feel on Inauguration Day until he was given more details. Senate GOP torn over convicting Trump: 'There's no love lost' \u201cI feel safe today, I have no idea how I\u2019m going to feel on the 20th because I don\u2019t know what they are going to put in place\u201d Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, said. Since the violent attack on the Capitol and in preparation for inauguration, metal detectors have been installed in front of the House floor that all members and staff must pass through, a move met with pushback from all sides. While some have complained of its inconvenience or pointed out how the lines it has created could result in Covid exposure, other have pointed out their installation underscores the lack of trust that exists on the Hill in the wake of the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sad commentary that we\u2019ve had to install metal detectors outside the House floor because fellow colleagues could pose a threat to the safety and security of members\u201d a Democratic aide told CNN. Similarly, some Republican members have also been uncomfortable about some of their caucus who are known to carry guns, according to a GOP source. Several House members have been making inquiries with private security firms about obtaining personal protective details in the wake of violence and threats against Congress, according to a person familiar with the security planning. In response to mounting concerns from members about their safety, the Committee on House Administration circulated a letter earlier this week reminding them what security measures they could expense, and the process for beefing up their security protocols. Members can get reimbursed for purchasing a bulletproof vest, for hiring security personnel in certain instances or for getting their own security training, and for making a range of security enhancements to their district offices. Lawmakers are adamant that the pressure must be kept up on Trump to keep him in check in during these the final days, the sources told CNN. McConnell has leverage over the President because he could, at least theoretically, begin the impeachment trial before Trump leaves office, if he wanted to take that step. As CNN previously reported, there are still more questions than answers about whether the pro-Trump rioters had any inside help. There are early indications, as well as unverified accusations, that some GOP lawmakers collaborated with some of the extremist conspiracy theorists that organized the rallies and could have even given \u201creconnaissance\u201d tours to rioters before the attack. A group of Democratic lawmakers asked the US Capitol Police to launch an investigation to possible collaboration between members of Congress and the rioters who attacked the building. Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who was captured in an iconic photograph hiding in the House gallery during the attack, said Thursday on CNN that some lawmakers gave tours even though tours have been prohibited since the pandemic began. \u201cWe are going to follow where the facts lead us,\u201d Crow said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to make any assumptions. I\u2019m not a mind reader.\u201d He also said he had \u201cmisplaced confidence\u201d in the US Capitol Police to keep him and other lawmakers safe from threats. Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, one of the co-signers of the letter, confirmed to CNN that she saw groups of six to eight people in MAGA apparel on tours. one or two days before the attack. Trump defenders seek Cheney's ouster from House leadership over impeachment vote \u201cI had seen what appeared to be tour groups of folks dressed in MAGA attire, in the halls, in the tunnels\u201d Scanlon told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what day it was, it was just surprising to see that happen because since Covid the building has been shut down. There aren\u2019t supposed to be any tours. So I kind of assumed it must be a new member who didn\u2019t know the rules or something. But, I mean, I can verify that it happened. There were people who were roaming around in the halls, apparently under the guidance of congressional staff.\u201d As the massive criminal probe ramps up, this angle will be an intense focus for the Justice Department and FBI as they try to figure out if any lawmakers or staffers aided a conspiracy to attack the Capitol and disrupt the Electoral College proceedings. \u201cMuch more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but what we know now is enough,\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican in the House, said in an ominous statement earlier this week announcing her strong support for Trump\u2019s impeachment. It isn\u2019t clear what future revelations Cheney was referring to, but she is a plugged-in lawmaker with connections throughout Washington, who would likely be in a position to gain insights on the investigation before things become clear to the public.

            "article_content": "Two US Capitol Police officers were suspended and at least 10 more are under investigation for their behavior during last week\u2019s assault on the Capitol, and federal agents will look at whether current and former law enforcement officers played a role in the riot. One of the Capitol police officers took a selfie with someone who was part of the mob that overtook the Capitol and the other wore a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat and started directing people around the building, according to Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat. He didn\u2019t disclose how many other officers were under investigation but confirmed it was between 10 and 15, and didn\u2019t say what they were being scrutinized for except that it was their behavior during the riot. Ryan told reporters that one individual had been arrested, but a spokesperson for the congressman later said he was wrong and no members of law enforcement have been arrested. The spokesperson said at least 10 Capitol Police officers are being investigated for their roles in the riot. A House aide separately said there are as many as 17 officers under investigation as part of eight investigations into the insurrection at the Capitol. In a statement Monday night, Capitol Police acting Chief Yogananda Pittman said several officers were suspended. She said the department \u201chas been actively reviewing video and other open source materials of some USCP officers and officials that appear to be in violation of Department regulations and policies. Our Office of Professional Responsibility will investigate these behaviors for disciplinary action, up to, and including, termination. Several USCP officers have already been suspended pending the outcome of their investigations.\u201d The federal investigative interest is a priority and a part of the broader investigation into the mob at the Capitol, sources said. The investigation into insurrectionist ties to law enforcement is a priority because the skills that officers are trained to use during their duties could be useful to an extremist mob, authorities say. This includes clearing rooms, taking custody of people, securing areas and handling firearms. Democratic members of the House have also raised questions about potential sympathies for the attackers among the ranks of US Capitol Police. That agency hasn\u2019t responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat, is among those who have others questions about whether some Capitol Police officers aided the protesters and were complicit in Wednesday\u2019s insurrection. Clyburn, for instance, said it was fishy that the rioters knew the location of lawmakers\u2019 offices. Early videos \u2013 one showing a Trump supporter taking a selfie with a police officer near an entrance to the Capitol and another appearing to show police letting protesters into the building \u2013 went viral on social media. The second video was later found to have been taken an hour after the Capitol had been breached. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who chairs one of the House committees that oversee Capitol Police, said there would be an investigation into those videos. \u201cA number of social media have indicated concerns about individual officers who, you know, if you look at the video, may have taken selfies with these seditionists or even let them in,\u201d Lofgren said. \u201cWe need to thoroughly investigate that, but I also know there were many officers who responded with tremendous bravery. Many officers were injured protecting the Capitol and we do thank them for their patriotism in protecting this temple of democracy.\u201d At least seven officers in five other departments across the country have come under internal investigations as their presence in Washington during the assault comes to light through social media or other means. One officer in New York, one in Philadelphia, two in Seattle, two in Virginia and one in Texas are under investigation by their departments for potential rules violations. Additionally, some departments have been contacted by the FBI as part of their criminal investigation into the overrunning of the Capitol. The number may grow as investigators and the public sift through social media and lodge allegations that officers may have been involved in the siege. Police departments have said their investigation will hinge on what type of involvement officers are found to had with last week\u2019s assault. \u201cThere\u2019s a big difference between walking down Pennsylvania Avenue and expressing yourself and going into a building where rioters pushed police and hit police and pushed them out of the way to get in,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. \u201cThat will be the question. They just came and they marched, versus did they go inside the building and become part of a (riot).\u201d No law enforcement member has been charged with a crime. More than 70 million people voted for Trump in the 2020 election and he often touted police as strong supporters. An on-duty officer was killed in last week\u2019s assault and dozens of others were injured. The Fraternal Order of Police, which supported Trump in both the 2016 and 2020 elections, released a statement calling on him to denounce those who attacked the Capitol and urging everyone to \u201creject the use of violence and to obey the orders of law enforcement.\u201d The FBI is investigating the attack on the Capitol and members of Congress have promised investigations. A spokeswoman for the Capitol Police has not responded to requests for comment. Wexler said almost every police department has a \u201cconduct unbecoming\u201d section of its rulebook that could be used to discipline officers for their conduct Wednesday. Officers can exercise their First Amendment rights but need to preserve credibility so they can testify, he said. \u201cBeing a police officer really is different from other positions in that credibility is very important in terms of testifying in cases,\u201d he said. \u201cYour activity outside when you\u2019re a police officer becomes relevant to testifying. \u2026 That worries police chiefs. That\u2019s why you have internal affairs investigations opened up when you have reason to believe officers were involved.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s worth investigating. It\u2019s totally worth investigating,\u201d Wexler said. \u201cYou have a police officer who died as a result of these rioters. You have enormous concerns about safety, about police officers working the event.\u201d Wexler said investigators have will to determine whether they were just attending a rally or if they gained access to the Capitol with the mob seeking to overturn the election. \u201cDid they use the fact they were police officers to gain access in some way? That would be highly problematic. Did they go into the building and follow others who broke into the building? That would be highly problematic and could cost them their job,\u201d Wexler said. Spokespeople for the Houston, Los Angeles, San Jose, San Antonio, San Diego, Phoenix and Denver police departments have said their agencies have not been contacted by the FBI and there aren\u2019t any open internal investigations into officers. Chicago police are investigating whether members violated rules or laws but haven\u2019t found any evidence so far, a spokesman said. Dallas police haven\u2019t responded to a request for comment. The New York Police Department has opened an investigation into one member of the police department, according to New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea. \u201cThere is one investigation that is active on one member,\u201d he told CNN affiliate NY1 Monday. \u201cThere is no name yet released, because we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not. \u2026 Anyone committing crimes certainly would have a very short shelf life with the NYPD.\u201d The Philadelphia Police Department is investigating whether one of its detectives participated in the riots. A department spokesman said the department was aware of social media posts that allegedly show a member of its force at the Capitol on Wednesday. \u201cAt this time, we are aware of social media posts that allege that a PPD detective may have been in attendance at the events on Washington, DC on January 6,\u201d Gripp said. \u201cAn IAB investigation has been opened to determine if any PPD polices were violated by the detective, and if they participated in any illegal activities while in attendance. The detective\u2019s assignment has been changed pending the outcome of the investigation.\u201d The Seattle police department has placed at least two officers on administrative leave while officials investigate whether they took part in the riot, the department\u2019s chief \u2013 Adrian Diaz \u2013 said in a statement on Friday night. \u201cThe Department fully supports all lawful expressions of First Amendment freedom of speech, but the violent mob and events that unfolded at the US Capitol were unlawful and resulted in the death of another police officer,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThe incident has been forwarded to the Office of Police Accountability for full review of any SPD employee activities at the US Capitol.\u201d The chief added he will immediately fire any officer found to have taken part in the mob at the Capitol. Two Rocky Mount, Virginia, police officers are on administrative leave after attending the demonstrations in Washington, according to the Rocky Mount Police Department. \u201cThe Town of Rocky Mount fully supports all lawful expressions of freedom of speech and assembly by its employees but does not condone the unlawful acts that occurred that day,\u201d the department said in a statement. \u201cBased on the available information, the Police Department has notified federal authorities and the individuals that were present at the event are on administrative leave pending review.\u201d In Texas, the Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office is initiating an internal affairs investigation after a lieutenant, who has been on administrative leave for an unrelated ongoing internal affairs investigation, posted selfies and photos to social media identifying herself as a Bexar County Sheriff\u2019s Office employee while attending the pro-Trump rally in Washington, according to the office. In a video statement sent to CNN, Sheriff Javier Salazar said he was notified about the posts to his personal social media account. \u201cI then took those screenshots and forwarded them to my chiefs and ordered them to initiate an internal affairs investigation on the administrative violations, if any,\u201d he said. \u201cThen I turned those same screenshots over to the FBI.\u201d \u201cNow, I know that the FBI is probably going to be the handling agency to look at the whole incident, and they\u2019re going to determine what, if anything, people did that was criminal and then maybe some people there were just peaceful protesters. At this point, to be fair, I don\u2019t know what her involvement is, but I turned this information over to the FBI to allow them to factor it into their ongoing investigation.\u201d The lieutenant has been on administrative leave since October, according to Salazar, and she had been stripped of all her agency property and her credentials. \u201cRight now, she doesn\u2019t wear a uniform, she doesn\u2019t carry a badge. It is unpaid administrative leave. It is not determined yet, at what point that investigation is over with. To be fair, we don\u2019t know what the outcome will be of that, but certainly this is going to tend to complicate that other investigation as it unfolds,\u201d he said. This story has been updated with additional information on police involvement in last week\u2019s riot at the US Capitol.

            "article_content": "Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close ally of President Donald Trump who was critical of the President this week, was confronted and screamed at by Trump supporters at Reagan National Airport, according to videos posted on social media Friday. \u201cYou traitor,\u201d a woman screams at the senator in one video, as he walks through one of the terminals at the Washington, DC, area airport. \u201cLindsey Graham,\u200b you are a traitor to the country.\u201d In the video, the senator at one point appeared to \u200brespond to someone \u200bin the crowd but it\u2019s unclear what he said. A second video posted on YouTube showed that security eventually escorted him to a stairwell. \u201cYou saw how we surrounded him,\u201d one man says in that video after the confrontation ended. \u201cIf we were really violent people, we could have ended him right there and then. But we didn\u2019t, we just asked him questions.\u201d In another video, obtained by a Politico reporter, a woman dressed in a QAnon shirt is heard saying, \u201cOne day they will not be able to walk down the street; it is today.\u201d Asked for comment on the video, Kevin Bishop, the senator\u2019s communications director told CNN, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss security issues involving Senator Graham.\u201d A Reagan National Airport spokesperson told CNN there were no charges related to the incident. The backlash directed at Graham was sparked after the Republican senator\u2019s criticism of Trump after a violent pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol on Wednesday. The riot came as a joint session of Congress had convened to count Electoral College votes and affirm President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory \u2013 which Trump has protested by repeatedly making false claims that the election was stolen from him. Graham said at a news conference the next day that the President\u2019s accomplishments have been \u201ctarnished by yesterday\u201d and the attack \u201cwill be a major part of his presidency.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to accountability, the President needs to understand that his actions were the problem, not the solution,\u201d he added. He also called on Trump to \u201caccept he fell short\u201d in the election \u201cand a new president will be coming,\u201d asking him to \u201cturn down the rhetoric and allow us as a nation to heal and move forward.\u201d Graham did not support objections raised against Arizona\u2019s and Pennsylvania\u2019s electoral votes. Both objections failed in the Senate and Congress ultimately finished its vote count to affirm Biden\u2019s White House win. \u201cYou garbage human being,\u201d a woman is heard yelling in the video. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be like this forever wherever you go for the rest of your life.\u201d Graham won a fourth term in November, defeating a well-funded Democratic challenger in a competitive reelection that earned national attention. People in the video can also be heard screaming at Graham, saying that he was \u201cpart of the Chinese Communist party,\u201d an apparent allusion to baseless QAnon conspiracy theories. \u201cYou don\u2019t represent us anymore,\u201d a person is heard yelling. Another yelled, \u201cYou better enjoy Gitmo.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley offered pro-Trump demonstrators who stood outside the Capitol a raised fist salute as he walked into the Senate early on Wednesday, buoyant about his leading role in objecting to President Donald Trump\u2019s electoral defeat. Mere hours later, some of those same Trump supporters would be marauding through the Capitol in a violent scene that will now be forever tied with the senator\u2019s attempt to overturn a free and fair election. Hawley is now a pariah among many of his colleagues, openly derided and mocked in his home state and a source of shame for longtime political supporters who helped propel him to his position. If the photo of Hawley striding into the Capitol captured how the senator thought this week would go, it was a photo taken hours later, one of a masked Hawley sitting alone in the House chamber once the Capitol complex had been secured, that encapsulated how the week actually went. \u201cSen. Hawley was doing something that was really dumbass and I\u2019ve been really clear about that in public and in private since long before the announcement he was going to do this,\u201d Republican Sen. Ben Sasse told NPR on Friday. \u201cIt was a stunt, and it was a terrible, terrible idea, and you don\u2019t lie to the American people. \u2026 Lies have consequences.\u201d To be sure, Hawley\u2019s decision to be the face of the baseless Republican challenge to the election has endeared him to the pro-Trump base of the party, a powerful force if the Missouri Republican does run for President. But Trump\u2019s hold on the party is an open question after the chaotic riot he fomented on Wednesday, leading any Republican who hoped to be the heir apparent to his political fortune in a precarious position. Hawley \u2013 whose office did not respond to requests to speak to the senator about his week \u2013 announced on December 30 that he would object during the Electoral College certification process, defying Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Nearly a dozen other Republican lawmakers, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, later announced that they, too, would object. Because of that \u2013 along with the pervasive view that Hawley was doing it as a way to brandish his credentials with pro-Trump Republicans ahead of a 2024 presidential run \u2013 Hawley has borne the brunt of the blame for kicking off the actions that led to thousands of Trump supporters storming the Capitol complex on Wednesday afternoon and forcing both the House and Senate to go into emergency lockdown. And the response has been fierce and personal. David Humphreys, a major donor to Hawley\u2019s political rise, decried the senator in the wake of the insurrection, calling him a \u201cpolitical opportunist\u201d and blaming his \u201cirresponsible, inflammatory, and dangerous tactics\u201d for sparking the riots. And to cap his criticism, Humphreys called for the Republican lawmaker to be censured. Hawley also lost the support of his one-time mentor this week, when former Sen. John Danforth \u2013 a man whose support was central to Hawley winning his 2018 Republican primary \u2013 said supporting the Republican lawmaker was \u201cthe worst mistake of my life.\u201d \u201cSupporting Josh and trying so hard to get him elected to the Senate was the worst mistake I ever made in my life,\u201d Danforth said in a statement to the St. Louis Today. \u201cYesterday was the physical culmination of the long attempt \u2026 to foment a lack of public confidence in our democratic system.\u201d And in the wake of the insurrection, which took the lives of five people, multiple newspapers in Hawley\u2019s home state either blamed the senator for the chaos or called on him to resign his seat. \u201cNo one other than President Donald Trump himself is more responsible for Wednesday\u2019s coup attempt at the U.S. Capitol than one Joshua David Hawley,\u201d wrote the editorial board of The Kansas City Star, a paper that endorsed the would-be senator in the 2018 Republican primary. \u201cHawley\u2019s actions in the last week had such impact that he deserves an impressive share of the blame for the blood that\u2019s been shed.\u201d What we know about the 5 deaths in the pro-Trump mob that stormed the Capitol And the St. Louis Post Dispatch editorial board mocked Hawley, accusing him of having the \u201cgall to stand before the Senate Wednesday night and feign shock, shock at what happened.\u201d \u201cHawley\u2019s tardy, cover-his-ass condemnation of the violence ranks at the top of his substantial list of phony, smarmy and politically expedient declarations,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHawley\u2019s presidential aspirations have been flushed down the toilet because of his role in instigating Wednesday\u2019s assault on democracy. He should do Missourians and the rest of the country a big favor and resign now.\u201d Hawley responded to the violence on Capitol Hill with a short statement: \u201cThe violence must end, those who attacked police and broke the law must be prosecuted, and Congress must get back to work and finish its job.\u201d But the damage, both to the Capitol and to Hawley, had long been done. And as anger at the senator smoldered, it began to extend beyond the Senate chamber and into the business world. Simon & Schuster, the book publisher that was set to publish Hawley\u2019s forthcoming book, announced Thursday that they would no longer distribute the book, an extraordinary move that seemingly made to prevent protests against the company. \u201cAfter witnessing the disturbing, deadly insurrection that took place on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., Simon & Schuster has decided to cancel publication of Senator Josh Hawley\u2019s forthcoming book,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe did not come to this decision lightly.\u201d Hawley slammed the decision as a \u201cdirect assault on the First Amendment\u201d \u2013 the Yale Law School graduate ignoring the fact that the First Amendment restricts the government from infringing on free speech, not private companies. Hawley\u2019s stock had fallen so low that even professional basketball coaches took the chance to dunk on the senator \u201c(Josh) Hawley\u2019s a joke,\u201d San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said during his pregame address on Thursday, saying both the Missouri senator and Cruz let their \u201cself-interest, their greed, their lust for power outweigh their love of country or their sense of duty to the constitution or to public service.\u201d When the Senate reconvened, Hawley continued his objection, speaking as the Senate debated the results from Arizona and later objecting to the results from Pennsylvania. As Hawley spoke from the Senate floor \u2013 \u201cWhat we are doing tonight is actually very important,\u201d he told his colleagues \u2013 the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, sat stoically behind him glaring into the back of Hawley\u2019s head. Romney, a usually composed political, rose to speak shortly after and his anger at colleagues like Hawley was evident. \u201cWhat happened here today was an insurrection, incited by the President of the United States,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThose who choose to continue to support his dangerous gambit by objecting to the results of a legitimate, democratic election will forever be seen as being complicit in an unprecedented attack against our democracy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The US Capitol is once again secured but four people are dead \u2013 including one woman who was shot \u2013 after supporters of President Donald Trump breached one of the most iconic American buildings, engulfing the nation\u2019s capital in chaos after Trump urged his supporters to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that will confirm President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win. Shortly after 1 p.m. ET Wednesday hundreds of pro-Trump protesters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, where they tussled with officers in full riot gear, some calling the officers \u201ctraitors\u201d for doing their jobs. About 90 minutes later, police said demonstrators got into the building and the doors to the House and Senate were being locked. Shortly after, the House floor was evacuated by police. Vice President Mike Pence was also evacuated from the chamber, where he was to perform his role in the counting of electoral votes. An armed standoff took place at the House front door at about 3 p.m. ET, and police officers had their guns drawn at someone who was trying to breach it. A Trump supporter was also pictured standing at the Senate dais earlier in the afternoon. A woman, who is yet to be identified, died after being shot in the chest on the Capitol grounds, DC police confirmed to CNN. More information on the shooting was not immediately available and a police spokesperson said additional details will come later. DC Police Chief Robert Contee said three other people died from medical emergencies during the riot. \u201cOne adult female and two adult males appear to have suffered from separate medical emergencies, which resulted in their deaths. Any loss of life in the District is tragic and our thoughts are with anyone impacted by their loss,\u201d Contee said at a news conference Wednesday night. Multiple officers have been injured with at least one transported to the hospital, multiple sources tell CNN. Smoke grenades were used on the Senate side of the Capitol, as police worked to clear the building of rioters. Windows on the west side of the Senate were broken, and hundreds of officers amassed on the first floor of the building. The Senate floor was cleared of rioters as of 3:30 p.m. ET, and an officer told CNN that they successfully squeezed them away from the Senate wing of the building and toward the Rotunda. The protesters were removed through the east and west doors of the Capitol. At least 52 people were arrested as of 9:30 p.m. ET Wednesday in Washington. The US Capitol Police worked to secure the second floor of the Capitol first, and were seen just before 5 p.m. ET pushing demonstrators off the steps on the east side of the building. With about 30 minutes to go before Washington\u2019s 6 p.m. ET curfew, Washington police amassed in a long line to push the mob back from the Capitol grounds. It took until roughly 5:40 p.m. ET for the building to once again be secured, according to the sergeant-at-arms. The stunning display of insurrection was the first time the US Capitol had been overrun since the British attacked and burned the building in August of 1814, during the War of 1812, according to Samuel Holliday, director of scholarship and operations with the US Capitol Historical Society. The shocking scene was met with less police force than many of the Black Lives Matter protests that rolled across the country in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police officers last year. While federal police attacked peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square outside the White House over the summer, clearing the way for Trump to take a photo in front of a nearby church at the time, protesters on Wednesday were able to overrun Capitol police and infiltrate the country\u2019s legislative chambers.  The protesters first breached exterior security barriers, and video footage showed protesters gathering and some clashing with police near the Capitol building. CNN\u2019s team on the ground saw a number of protesters trying to move up the side of the Capitol building. Several loud flash bangs were heard as well. Protesters could be seen pushing against metal fences and police used the fences to push protesters back, while other officers reached over the top to club people trying to cross their lines. Flash bangs could be heard near the steps of the Capitol as smoke filled the air. In some instances officers could be seen deploying pepper spray. Tear gas was deployed, but it\u2019s not clear whether by protesters or police, and people wiped tears from their eyes while coughing. After the building was breached, the Capitol police officer in the House chamber told lawmakers that they may need to duck under their chairs and informed lawmakers that protesters were in the building\u2019s Rotunda. Lots of House members were seen wearing gas masks as they moved between Capitol buildings. Members were calling family to say they were OK. Congressional leaders were being evacuated from the Capitol complex just before 5 p.m. ET and were set to be taken to Fort McNair, a nearby Army base in Washington, according to a federal law enforcement official. Trump has directed the National Guard to Washington along with \u201cother federal protective services,\u201d according to White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. The entire DC National Guard has been activated by the Department of Defense, according to the Pentagon. \u201cThe D.C. Guard has been mobilized to provide support to federal law enforcement in the District,\u201d said Jonathan Hoffman, the chief Pentagon spokesman. \u201cActing Secretary Miller has been in contact with Congressional leadership, and Secretary McCarthy has been working with the D.C. government. The law enforcement response will be led by the Department of Justice.\u201d The official said DC National Guard was not anticipating to be used to protect federal facilities, and the Trump administration had decided earlier this week that would be the task of civilian law enforcement, the official said. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser announced a citywide curfew from 6 p.m. ET on Wednesday until 6 a.m. ET Thursday. Lawmakers began returning to the Capitol after the building was secured and made it clear that they intended to resume their intended business \u2013 namely, confirming Biden\u2019s win over Trump by counting the votes in the Electoral College. Proceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Pence \u2013 who never left the Capitol, according to his press secretary \u2013 bringing the Senate session back into order. \u201cLet\u2019s get back to work,\u201d he said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement earlier Wednesday evening that congressional leadership wanted to continue with the joint session Wednesday night. \u201cToday, a shameful assault was made on our democracy. It was anointed at the highest level of government. It cannot, however, deter us from our responsibility to validate the election of Joe Biden,\u201d Pelosi wrote. \u201cTo that end, in consultation with Leader Hoyer and Whip Clyburn and after calls to the Pentagon, the Justice Department and the Vice President, we have decided we should proceed tonight at the Capitol once it is cleared for use. Leader Hoyer will be sending out more guidance later today.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor that the \u201cUnited States Senate will not be intimidated. We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs or threats.\u201d It took until deep in the early hours of Thursday morning, but Congress eventually counted and certified Biden\u2019s election win. Trump finally called on his supporters to \u201cgo home\u201d hours after the riot started, but spent a large amount of time in the one-minute video lamenting and lying about his election loss. In one stunning line, Trump told the mob to \u201cgo home,\u201d but added, \u201cWe love you. You are very special.\u201d Trump struck a sympathetic tone to the rioters he himself unleashed, saying, \u201cI know your pain, I know you\u2019re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it. Especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace.\u201d However, later on in the evening Trump justified the mob\u2019s actions and praised them. \u201cThese are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love & in peace. Remember this day forever!\u201d he said, in a tweet that was later deleted by Twitter. Others inside the President\u2019s orbit tweeted their calls for calm as the mob repeatedly attempted to take over the building. Donald Trump Jr., the President\u2019s son, said that his supporters who mobbed the Capitol were \u201cwrong and not who we are.\u201d \u201cBe peaceful and use your 1st Amendment rights, but don\u2019t start acting like the other side. We have a country to save and this doesn\u2019t help anyone,\u201d he tweeted. Federal and local law enforcement responded to reports of possible pipe bombs in multiple locations in Washington, DC, according to a federal law enforcement official. A pipe bomb was found at the Republican National Committee\u2019s headquarters, a RNC official told CNN. The device was found on the ground outside, along the wall of the headquarters. It was safely detonated by the police, the RNC official said. At least two suspected pipe bombs were rendered safe by law enforcement \u2013 the one at the building that houses RNC offices and one in the US Capitol complex, a federal law enforcement official told CNN. The official said these were real explosive devices and they were detonated safely. The Democratic National Committee was also evacuated after a suspicious package was being investigated nearby, a Democratic source familiar with the matter told CNN. The party had preemptively closed the building ahead of the protests, the source said, but a few security and essential personnel were evacuated. Near the scene where one of the pipe bombs was found Wednesday, police detained a suspect and found a vehicle with a rifle and as many as 10 Molotov cocktails, according to a federal law enforcement official. Investigators are working to determine whether there\u2019s a connection to the bombs found earlier. This story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown, Phil Mattingly, and Daniela Diaz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "For decades, the Arizona Republican Party was synonymous with the state\u2019s senior Sen. John McCain. Arizonans loved McCain\u2019s military heroism and noted willingness to buck party leaders, sending him to the House twice and to the Senate five times. His death, from brain cancer in August 2018, was a moment of national grieving. All of which makes this tweet, on January 1, from the Arizona Republican Party\u2019s official Twitter account all the more shocking: \u201cAs the sun sets on 2020, remember that we\u2019re never going back to the party of Romney, Flake, and McCain. The Republican Party is now, and forever will be, one for the working man and woman! God bless.\u201d Uh, what? Or in the words of Meghan McCain, a co-host on \u201cThe View\u201d and the late senator\u2019s daughter: \u201cHonestly whomever is running this Twitter account can go to hell.\u201d While the attempt to soil the reputation of a deceased senator (and decorated war hero) drew considerable national attention, the Arizona Republican Party has been using its Twitter feed to savage McCain and other non-Trump worshiping Republicans for a while now. \u201cHow do we keep losing followers when we mention Mr. McCain,\u201d the state party tweeted on December 22. \u201cBut we gain many, many followers when we say #FightForTrump. Oh well, it\u2019s only Twitter!\u201d State party chair Kelli Ward, in response to a tweet thread by Arizona Republican Gov. Doug Ducey defending his handling of the state\u2019s presidential election, told the governor to \u201c#sthu\u201d (shut the hell up), adding: \u201cElection Integrity is missing in Arizona. Period.\u201d Which, well, wow. This turn to Trumpism \u2013 and away from the likes of McCain \u2013 can be traced most recently to Ward\u2019s election as state party chair in January 2019. To claim the job, she upset the sitting state party chairman \u2013 a McCain ally. For Ward, it marked a long-awaited positive result in her attempts to unseat the party establishment in the state. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Ward ran a primary against McCain back in 2016, but the incumbent won easily. Ward drew considerable national attention in that race for her suggestion that McCain was a) old and b) might die in office. \u201cI\u2019m a doctor. The life expectancy of the American male is not 86. It\u2019s less,\u201d she told Politico. Ward kept up that drumbeat. Within days of McCain going public with his cancer diagnosis in July 2017, Ward, who was running in a primary against Sen. Jeff Flake (R) at the time, said this: \u201cI hope that Senator McCain is going to look long and hard at this, that his family and his advisers are going to look at this, and they\u2019re going to advise him to step away as quickly as possible. So that the business of the country and the business of Arizona being represented at the federal level can move forward.\u201d In 2018, when McCain\u2019s family announced he had decided to end treatment for the cancer, a Ward staffer even questioned the timing of the announcement \u2013 suggesting that it was designed to negatively impact Ward\u2019s primary campaign. \u201cI think they wanted to have a particular narrative that they hope is negative to me,\u201d the candidate agreed. Later, she apologized for the comment. (Flake was later forced into retirement after publicly urging Republicans to break with Trump. Ward lost the subsequent primary to establishment favorite Martha McSally.) Seen through this lens, the drastic anti-McCain, anti-establishment, pro-Trump turn of the Arizona state party makes a heck of a lot more sense. Ward has been fighting with McCain (and other establishment figures) for years and, after repeatedly losing quixotic primary challenges to them, she hopped aboard the Trump train and rode it to victory. And now that Ward has some power, she is using it to reshape the Arizona Republican Party\u2019s present and future. A look through the state party\u2019s Twitter feed over the past month makes that crystal clear, as it not only appears to aim to invoke not only Trump\u2019s mentality but also the way he tweets. \u201cThe Arizona Legislature should DE-CERTIFY the false results of the 2020 election until at which time a full and thorough audit of the vote can be performed,\u201d the account tweeted over the weekend. \u201cDo it quick. Make Democrats lose their collective minds as they rage against transparency and integrity. Big win for AZ!\u201d That same day the state party tweeted this after the news of California Rep. Devin Nunes (R) being awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom broke: \u201cSerious question: Is there anyone on earth more deserving of the Presidential Medal of Freedom than @DevinNunes?\u201d And then, earlier Tuesday, the account tweeted a video of Ward repeating \u201cher call for the Arizona State Legislature to decertify the so-called results of the 2020 Presidential Election until a full and transparent audit can be completed.\u201d So, yeah. What happened to the Arizona Republican Party? Trump happened. And Ward\u2019s rhetoric and actions as chair of the state GOP are a reminder that the President\u2019s impact will be felt long after he leaves office on January 20. CNN\u2019s Allison Gordon contributed to this analysis.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cYou\u2019re so merry,\u201d says Tom Wambsgans in the \u201cToo Much Birthday\u201d episode of \u201cSuccession,\u201d the television series that depicts the desperately unhappy lives of a media mogul family. \u201cYou seem much happier than me, Greg,\u201d Tom complains to his relative-by-marriage, who\u2019s exulting over landing a date. Cousin Greg comes across as clueless in the show on HBO (which, like CNN, is owned by WarnerMedia), until he periodically reveals his inner sage. He really is happy, Greg admits \u2013 \u201cI like her\u201d \u2013 and then advises: \u201cIt\u2019s not a finite pie; we can both be happy.\u201d In 2021, happiness has too often seemed like a \u201cfinite pie.\u201d The year began with an attack on the US Capitol and ended with surges of Covid-19 in a pandemic that refuses to release its hold on us. In our last weekly opinion column before the new year, we\u2019re focusing on the points of view that were most popular with you \u2013 and with the team at CNN Opinion \u2013 this year. (We\u2019re taking a break next week and returning on January 2.) You can sample the 40 pieces that told the story of the year here. Last week, CNN Opinion\u2019s Jane Greenway Carr recounted the \u201csocial commentary and cultural criticism that helped us look hard into the darkness, bridge the gaps between us and, sometimes, take hold of the light.\u201d We have the rare luxury of being able to publish opinion pieces on any topic under \u2013 and around \u2013 the sun, and the favorites some of our team members chose reflect that variety, touching on everything from space junk to \u201cTed Lasso\u201d to the Czech election. Here are their choices: Jessica Chia picked \u201cThe growing problem of space junk,\u201d by Alice Gorman: Remember that brief, sweet window in May, when we could set aside any worries we had about Covid-19 and our decaying democracy and ask ourselves, \u201cWhat are the odds a rocket will fall out of the sky and land on me?\u201d The Long March 5B rocket was one of the largest uncontrolled space objects to fall out of orbit, and most of it burned up when it reentered the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, according to the Chinese government. \u201cReentry is considered the most desirable outcome as it removes space junk from orbit where it can collide with functioning satellites, create more junk, and threaten human life when it comes to crewed spacecraft,\u201d according to Dr. Alice Gorman, who is also known as Dr. Space Junk. But very little has been done on the environmental impact of this incineration in the atmosphere. Learn more in this fascinating piece, which includes this gem of a sentence: \u201cEarth\u2019s atmosphere has become a liminal zone that marks a zombie spacecraft\u2019s transition to true death.\u201d Kirsi Goldynia\u2019s favorite was \u201cGen Z\u2019s telling nostalgia for Bennifer, \u2018Friends\u2019 and Y2K,\u201d by Holly Thomas: I\u2019m a few years older than Gen Z\u2019ers, but I can fully relate to their desire to recreate some aspects of early 2000s culture while choosing to leave other less desirable parts in the dust. Holly Thomas captured this feeling of selective nostalgia perfectly when she wrote: \u201cAs a millennial who grew up during the noughties, I both envy and admire Gen Z\u2019ers\u2019 capacity to idealize those years. It\u2019s unfair that they\u2019re managing to make bucket hats and aggressive brand logos look anything besides tragic, but commendable that they\u2019re paying a ton more mind to where they\u2019re sourcing their clothes than we did.\u201d Yaffa Fredrick chose \u201c\u2018Ted Lasso\u2019 is not about what you think,\u201d by David N. Perry and Matthew Gabriele: Amid the stresses of the ongoing pandemic, one show reminded me to pause and enjoy the simple pleasures in life \u2014 \u201cTed Lasso.\u201d David M. Perry and Matthew Gabriele\u2019s op-ed on \u201cTed Lasso\u201d beautifully captures why the show succeeds in helping viewers disconnect from their day-to-day realities and instead embrace a world in which friendship and community take priority. They write that \u201cTed Lasso\u201d proves to us \u201cthere\u2019s a world possible in which people can count on one another.\u201d And while that\u2019s a lesson not even all the characters master by the end of the second season, it\u2019s one we can all aspire to as we enter the new year. Breeanna Hare picked \u201cThe tragic messages the Gabby Petito case sends,\u201d by Sonia Pruitt: This year hasn\u2019t been the breakthrough for equality that 2020 promised it could be. But at the very least, it seems we are getting better at calling out those disparities in all facets of American life \u2013 even within our response to tragedy. When 22-year-old Gabby Petito vanished on a road trip with her fiance in the fall, her story was a top headline from coast to coast in a rightful effort to gather information and bring a young woman home safely. And yet, as retired police captain Sonia Pruitt observed, it also reignited \u201ca national conversation about the lasting spotlight that is often given to missing White people, compared to their non-White counterparts.\u201d With this case, two things were true at once: Something horrible had happened to Petito and the nation was aware of it \u2013 and something horrible is happening when the missing person cases of people of color don\u2019t get nearly as much empathy. With thoughtfulness and sensitivity, Pruitt captured this reality with an unblinking honesty, calling on all of us to engage and change this truth. \u201cWhile Petito\u2019s family should of course be allowed to use everything at their disposal to get to the bottom of exactly what happened to Gabby, we cannot ignore the effects of that same level of access not being extended to the Black and brown, who are just as desperate to find missing loved ones,\u201d Pruitt wrote. \u201cAs a former police captain, it is particularly concerning what message this could be sending to perpetrators: that young people of color are easy targets because few will care to look for them.\u201d Jane Greenway Carr chose \u201cThe problem with \u2018bereavement\u2019 leave after pregnancy loss,\u201d by Lara Freidenfelds: In 2021, like 2020 before it, so many of us spent time feeling powerless or out of control. There was so much in our lives we couldn\u2019t do or weren\u2019t empowered to change, even when we wanted to. But as historian Lara Freidenfelds reminded us in this powerful piece on the need to rethink the language we use about pregnancy loss: Choices that seem small at the time can have enormous consequences in the everyday lives of those around us. By saying \u201closs\u201d instead of \u201cbereavement\u201d to make space to be inclusive of more people\u2019s diverse experiences and myriad feelings about miscarriage isn\u2019t just more accurate to the history of human beings\u2019 reproductive lives, she tells us; it\u2019s a more compassionate (and ultimately revolutionary) way to build policy. It\u2019s something we can do from where we stand to change harmful taboos and make people feel seen. Fundamentally, her point is that words have power and we can use them more effectively to make people\u2019s lives better. This year, that was a message I cherished and tried to live into. To Sheena McKenzie, this piece stood out: \u201cThis country\u2019s election may be the strategy to defeat Trumpism,\u201d by Dean Obeidallah: \u201cCzech election\u201d and \u201cedge-of-your-seat drama\u201d are not two phrases I would normally put together. But on a recent gray weekend in October I found myself reporting on exactly that \u2013 a cliffhanger election involving the \u201cCzech Donald Trump,\u201d a hospitalized president and a group called the \u201cPirate Party.\u201d Dean Obeidallah smartly unpacks why this offbeat election \u2013 where opposition parties joined forces to topple populist Prime Minister Andrej Babi\u0161 \u2013 has so much to teach the US about defeating Trumpism. Obeidallah writes that the US needs \u201ca pro-democracy coalition in the same way leaders in the Czech Republic were able to put aside political differences to defeat a right-wing, populist leader.\u201d And with more strongman elections coming up in 2022 (Orban in Hungary and Bolsonaro in Brazil), it\u2019s a tactic other nations will be watching closely. Many of our most popular pieces flowed out of the end of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and the start of Joe Biden\u2019s. Power was ultimately handed over on January 20, but the closing days of the Trump White House were epically chaotic, as police struggled to put down an insurrection aimed at stopping Congress\u2019 certification of Biden\u2019s victory and officials coped with the aftereffects. On January 6, after Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, Frida Ghitis called for \u201cMike Pence and the members of the Cabinet to pull the country back from the edge of abyss and remove Trump from office.\u201d As the year went on, many Republicans pivoted from condemning the attack to making excuses for it. But there were notable exceptions \u2013 including former President George W. Bush. As Paul Begala wrote, \u201cBush summed up the reaction to the attack on our Capitol \u2014 or at least the reaction of all decent, patriotic Americans \u2014 in just six words, as evocative as they are accurate: \u2018I was sick to my stomach.\u2019\u201d Trump never admitted that he lost the election, repeating instead a fabricated story that he was cheated by massive voter fraud. His refusal to come to terms with reality dominates the Republican Party today. It was no surprise that Trump didn\u2019t invite Biden to the White House for the traditional meeting between outgoing and incoming presidents, but even first lady Melania Trump skipped the nicety of hosting Jill Biden for tea. \u201cUnderstandably lost in the morass of the horrifying things that have happened leading up to Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration is something that did not happen,\u201d wrote Kate Andersen Brower. \u201cMelania Trump will become the first modern first lady not to invite the woman who will replace her to the White House for a walk-through of the private living quarters on the second and third floors.\u201d Trump skipped the inauguration, flying home to Mar-a-Lago on Air Force One, but Washington wasn\u2019t done with him. The former president had been impeached a week before his term was over and was eventually put on trial for the second time in the Senate, which voted to acquit him of inciting an insurrection. Days before his trial, Trump\u2019s legal team quit and had to be hastily replaced. As Elie Honig wrote, \u201cIt\u2019s telling that the source of the falling-out between Trump and his (former) lawyers was his insistence that they raise the \u2018stolen election\u2019 defense.\u201d  In red states across the nation, Republican legislators passed bills to limit access to the polls and bring election administrators more tightly under the control of political forces that could potentially overrule voters in future elections. As in other states, Trump spread phony questions about the results in Arizona, where Biden won by a narrow margin. There, Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer pushed back hard against Trump\u2019s insinuations. It was time \u201cto loudly speak the truth,\u201d he wrote in May. \u201cThe truth is that there is no solid evidence of significant fraud in Maricopa County\u2019s November 3 election. There is no solid evidence that the election in Maricopa County was stolen from former President Trump. That is why all eight cases brought in Arizona state and federal courts alleging widespread fraud, inaccuracies, or irregularities lost spectacularly.\u201d As former world chess champion Garry Kasparov wrote in the CNN Opinion \u201cVoices of Freedom\u201d series, democracy is too precious to let slip away. \u201cHailing from the Soviet Union, a repressive regime and precursor to Putin\u2019s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege \u2013 one that must constantly be defended. But over the last few years, I have watched with growing alarm as many Americans lose faith in their democratic system\u2026 Because democratic sentiment is weak, the rights to vote and free speech are more vulnerable in my adopted home of America today than at any point in my life.\u201d Now, \u201cwe can either be the generation that renews democracy, or loses it forever,\u201d Kasparov declared. \u201cThe clearest driver of distrust in US democracy is Trump\u2019s lie that he really won the 2020 election,\u201d wrote CNN Opinion\u2019s Yaffa Fredrick. \u201cDespite any evidence of systematic voter fraud, Trump and his loyalists continue to sow doubt about Biden\u2019s victory in the minds of the American people\u2026 they are achieving some degree of success. 36% of Americans \u2013 and a startling 78% of Republicans \u2013 now believe Biden did not win enough votes to be the legitimately elected president.\u201d Facebook was among the social media platforms that came under a torrent of criticism over the spread of misinformation about the election \u2013 and Covid-19 vaccines. The company, which now operates under the new corporate title of \u201cMeta,\u201d is \u201cignoring the truth, to your detriment,\u201d wrote Kara Alaimo, after \u201cFrances Haugen, a former Facebook project manager and now whistleblower, said the company is well aware that its social network is being used to promote hate, violence and misinformation \u2013 but it has tried to cover up the evidence in order to generate more revenue.\u201d Biden plowed ahead with pledges to return the nation to normalcy and lead America out of the Covid-19 pandemic, only to run into the Delta and Omicron variants of the virus. Still, he succeeded in passing and signing legislation to spend trillions to stimulate the economy and rebuild bridges, roads and other infrastructure. He repaired some alliances that had been strained in the Trump years and visited the UK, where his meeting with Queen Elizabeth II was judged a success despite a \u201cspectacular\u201d breach of royal protocol, as Rosa Prince noted. The new President faced divides in his own party, as progressives pushed him to move faster to reduce inequality and counter threats to voting rights while Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema withheld their support for a massive social spending bill that originally included sharp hikes in taxes on corporations and the wealthy. In September, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u201cmade her Met Gala debut in a long white off-shoulder mermaid gown, with \u2018Tax The Rich\u2019 scribed across the back in massive, flag-red letters,\u201d wrote Holly Thomas. \u201cIt was explicit, as close as you could come to having a placard at the gala without literally bringing one\u2026\u201d Biden\u2019s decision to pull all US troops out of Afghanistan, in accordance with the peace agreement with the Taliban negotiated by the Trump administration, led to the collapse of the Afghan government and a disorderly exodus from Kabul. Nick Ochsner, the son of a Green Beret killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, wrote, \u201cIf my dad were alive today, I know he would be worried about the thousands of Afghans who risked their lives and their families\u2019 security in service to an America that has now left many of them stranded, helpless, behind enemy lines.\u201d There were also tensions over the role of Vice President Kamala Harris, as Roxanne Jones noted. \u201cI\u2019m hoping she stays the course, steps fully into her powerful, intelligent, straight-talking self,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cBut please ditch the chuckle. It\u2019s time for Black women to bring their entire selves to the table. And even when we stumble, we got this.\u201d As the President\u2019s approval ratings dropped, Democrats fretted over who might lead their ticket in 2024 should Biden, who will turn 82 by the next presidential inauguration, choose not to run. Harris and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, once rivals for the 2020 presidential nomination, don\u2019t have to be competitors, wrote Lincoln Mitchell, who suggested they could run together on the same ticket. Since the start of 2021, more than 203 million Americans have been fully vaccinated against the virus that causes Covid-19, and more than 58 million have received booster shots. The vaccinations have saved millions from severe illness and death, but the vaccine-hesitant and vaccine resisters remain at great risk. At the beginning of the pandemic, Florida-based emergency room doctor Alex Busko\u2019s sickest patients were \u201calmost exclusively older people with chronic health problems.\u201d But in July, he wrote, \u201cNow the patients I see, frightened and struggling to breathe, are mostly in their 30s, 40s and 50s. They come from different racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Many of them have no identifiable risk factors. The one thing many of them have in common: They are all unvaccinated\u2026 Hundreds of Americans are dying every day from a vaccine-preventable illness.\u201d In April 2020, infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm told Peter Bergen that he expected 800,000 Americans could die of the disease within 18 months. Last week, the US surpassed that number, and in a recent follow-up interview conducted by Bergen, Osterholm warned, \u201cYou cannot outrun the game clock with this pandemic. This virus will find you and, unfortunately, many of the outcomes are very sad\u2026We have health care systems around the country, including in my home state of Minnesota, that are hanging on by a thread. We\u2019ve seen health care systems virtually broken by this pandemic. They just couldn\u2019t provide critical care to non-Covid patients. If you\u2019re not going to get vaccinated for yourself, please get vaccinated for your loved ones and for the community because this is a very challenging situation.\u201d The psychic toll of the pandemic is fearsome, as Thomas Lake wrote in January: \u201cAre you holding it together? I am not. Most days I struggle with grief and rage. I often cover my face with my hands. My fingers keep closing into fists.\u201d \u201cWhat is happening to me? To us? Maybe you\u2019re like me: afraid, anxious, nervous, or feeling whatever else you call that paralyzing sensation that radiates from below the ribcage up into your chest. You can\u2019t stop worrying about all you have left to lose.\u201d In a year when the world focused more than ever on the menace of climate change, John Sutter traveled to Wyoming to examine the impact of eventually ending the fossil fuel economy. \u201cGillette is the hub of a region called the Powder River Basin, which produces roughly 40% of US coal,\u201d Sutter wrote. \u201cResidents here know that the Biden administration, which rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate change and promises a 100% clean electric grid by 2035, could help push Gillette out of existence.\u201d The pandemic has been generous to the world\u2019s billionaires \u2013 their wealth has grown dramatically. As if to demonstrate their enormous resources, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and UK entrepreneur Richard Branson flew into space. Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX has jumped in front of rivals in its commercialization of space, was named Time\u2019s Person of the Year. Space tourism offers the luxury of \u201ca Disney park ride for the super-rich,\u201d noted physicist Don Lincoln, but there\u2019s more to it than that. The competition could benefit science and business. \u201cThe real bottom line is that the commercialization of space will reduce launch costs and that has benefits for anyone needing to lift an object above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere.\u201d But the billionaires should focus on improving life on earth, argued Holly Thomas. \u201cMitigating further climate damage is the most urgent challenge currently facing the planet \u2013 one which should interest the world\u2019s billionaires far more than that of stepping just over the well-trod threshold of space.\u201d \u2026Some highlights from the past week: Jill Filipovic: Panicky texts to Mark Meadows paint a damning picture Joshua Wurman: How to improve our odds against deadly tornadoes SE Cupp: Trump voters and Fox News viewers have been had Julian Zelizer: This moment is Biden\u2019s biggest leadership test Jennifer Williams: I\u2019m a transgender woman in America.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Alexander Vindman, a retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel, is a doctoral student at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, the author of the memoir, \u201cHere, Right Matters\u201d and a Renew Democracy Initiative board member. He previously served as the director for European Affairs on the White House\u2019s National Security Council. Andrei Sannikov was the former Deputy Foreign Minister for Belarus and is a fellow of the Renew Democracy Initiative\u2019s Frontlines of Freedom project. The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN. We come from countries thousands of miles apart, but we share one thing in common: In spite of the grave consequences we have faced, we still dare to speak the truth. Alexander is a whistleblower. He sacrificed his military career when he reported former President Donald Trump\u2019s threats to withhold support from Ukraine if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not help him dig up dirt on the Bidens. Andrei is a dissident. He resigned from the Belarusian government in 1996 in protest against the rising authoritarianism of President Alexander Lukashenko. In 2010, he dared to run against Lukashenko for President of Belarus. From our experiences, we have learned that when coming to democracy\u2019s defense, whistleblowers may pay with their careers, but dissidents often pay with their lives. In Alexander\u2019s case, independent media sought out the truth and Congress called on him to testify. While he suffered professional consequences, the government never imprisoned or threatened his life. In Andrei\u2019s case, Lukashenko had him detained and tortured. He was beaten, refused medical care and pressured to kill himself. Andrei was only released after more than a year in prison when coordinated sanctions from the EU and US appear to have grown too great for Lukashenko\u2019s regime to bear. (Though Lukashenko has not commented on Andrei\u2019s case, in a 2012 interview in which he declared himself a dictator, he denied claims of holding political prisoners.) 'Europe's last dictator': I have nothing to apologize for Although whistleblowers and dissidents play a critical role as truth seekers within society, our stories exemplify the sobering reality that we cannot effect change without additional support. Simply put, whistleblowers and dissidents can act as the catalysts for change, but it is the broader public that can alter the course of history. In the US, that knowledge and belief ebbs and flows. During moments of widespread grassroots mobilization and public outcry \u2013 including the Black Lives Matter protests, March for Our Lives protests, Women\u2019s March protests, as well as historic voter turnout during the 2018 midterm elections and 2020 presidential election \u2013 the public has created the push for systemic reforms to American democracy. An important fact to remember in this discussion is that these democratic demonstrations in the US have been largely peaceful. Protesters and grassroots organizations in the US are usually not forcefully repressed, and movements are allowed to develop organically. Like Alexander, people can generally speak out against injustice without fear of a government crackdown. This has been a critical element of the ongoing fight against anti-democratic forces, as well as a key feature of the American system, which has been flexible and resilient in responding to the will of the people during tumultuous periods. But the risk of political lethargy following the departure of former President Donald Trump is not something to be written off. Trump holds significant influence over the Republican Party \u2013 and Trumpism will undoubtedly be on the ballot during the 2022 midterm elections. American complacency has both short-term and long-term consequences. While in the short term, some proponents of the \u201cBig Lie\u201d could win elected office, significant danger lies in the long-term trends \u2013 namely the incremental replacement of more traditional politicians with Trumpian populists and conspiracy theorists. Three years from now, Trump could be the Republican nominee in the 2024 presidential election, decrying another close election loss. But this time he could have the support of enough state Republican officials complying with his demands to overturn unfavorable election results. We cannot merely address these issues once they have already become realities, as was the case during the surge of civil activism under the Trump presidency. We must be proactive in stemming authoritarianism now. In Belarus, by contrast, the most brutal form of authoritarianism is already a fact of life. Protests are met with violence. Under the repressive Lukashenko regime, the last vestiges of democratic institutions within civil society are being eradicated, and the opposition is actively suppressed. Our generation will either renew democracy -- or lose it forever Much like Andrei, hundreds of thousands of Belarusians have protested for an end to the Lukashenko regime\u2019s authoritarian excesses and a turn toward democracy. Yet their bravery and sacrifice have not been enough. Protestors have been under maximum pressure for years and need greater external support in order to be successful. Western governments have the tools and resources to exert increased pressure on Lukashenko and his officials. These governments can raise the costs of Lukashenko\u2019s repressions by tightening restrictions on the regime\u2019s ability to abuse Interpol, imposing additional sanctions, enhancing Global Magnitsky sanctions for human rights violations or targeting the oligarchs whose networks of corruption support the Kremlin, and by proxy, the Belarusian dictatorship. While this may not be enough on its own to force Lukashenko to negotiate with the opposition, it would demonstrate solidarity with pro-democracy forces while signaling that Lukashenko\u2019s regime will face consequences if they act with impunity. Some, such as the European Council, say the changes in Belarus have to come from within. But the push for change in Belarus is coming from within. To actually bring about democratic reform, Belarusians will require the collective action of other Western nations committed to the values and principles of basic human rights and freedoms. The United States could take the lead on this, since it already fulfills an indispensable role on the international stage as a defender, sponsor and promoter of democracy. It could play a critical role in strengthening Belarusian civil society by providing material and ideological support to the country\u2019s pro-democracy elements.  Given the current situation in Belarus, a prudent approach may be to provide financial, rhetorical, and organizational support to the leaders of the pro-democracy movement beyond the borders of the country. Critical figures, like Andrei, and organizations continue to strengthen and empower Belarusian civil society, even in exile. They facilitate a platform for the Belarusian opposition that provides hope for the future and offers a democratic alternative to the illegitimate Lukashenko regime. It is dangerous and irresponsible to believe that the US can abrogate its duties as the leader of the free world without consequences in the regions of the world where democracy is still struggling to establish a foothold. Belarusians, alongside countless other peoples, look to the US to set an example and represent an ideal worth striving for. American values and interests demand the defense of democracy both at home and abroad. While the US and Belarus are worlds apart, the Belarusian experience offers a frightening window into a world without basic freedoms. Believe us when we say, American democracy is worth defending, lest it come to resemble something closer to Belarus.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David A. Andelman, a contributor to CNN, two-time winner of the Deadline Club Award, and executive director of The Red Lines Project, is the author of \u201cA Red Line in the Sand: Diplomacy, Strategy, and the History of Wars That Might Still Happen\u201d and host of its Evergreen podcast. He formerly was a correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Europe and Asia. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. View more opinion at CNN. The warning was hardly veiled. Vladimir Chizhov, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s tough-minded representative to the European Union, recently said that if Europe wants to resolve any future issues with its supply of natural gas quickly, treating Russia as a \u201cpartner,\u201d not an \u201cadversary,\u201d will help. It\u2019s not the first signal that Russia is prepared to hold Europe hostage to natural gas prices, which are escalating dramatically. But with Europe currently facing an energy crunch, the context and timing are significant \u2013 on both sides of the Atlantic. It\u2019s quite clear that both Washington and Brussels need to mind what\u2019s on the mind of Chizhov \u2013  and especially Putin. For Europe, the price of not cozying up to Russia could be debilitating gas shortages this winter, not to mention exploding gas prices. Since natural gas is the primary heating fuel for Europe, this is a potentially existential threat. And lately, prices have shown a tendency to swing widely, often on the whim of, or prompted by, off-hand remarks uttered by one man: Vladimir Putin. On October 6, for example, prices surged early in the day, reaching a level 10 times their level at the start of the year, as the Financial Times reports. Within hours, however, Putin observed, \u201cLet\u2019s think through possibly increasing supply in the market, only we need to do it carefully. Settle with Gazprom and talk it over.\u201d (In other words, I can flip a switch and your economies and society can be turned on their head.) Within hours, prices saw a sharp reversal, the paper notes. This kind of hardly subtle pressure comes at a most sensitive moment for Europe. Energy crisis is a 'wake up call' for Europe to ditch fossil fuels Germany is still trying to cobble together a coalition governmen \u2013 and identify a successor to Angela Merkel as chancellor \u2013 following an election in which no clear leader emerged. With French President Emmanuel Macron on the cusp of launching his own reelection campaign, rising gas prices heading into winter could harm his standing. Europe could be at an inflection point in its energy-driven vulnerability to Russia, for two reasons. A new pipeline from Russia\u2019s gas fields to Germany \u2013 dubbed Nord Stream 2 \u2013 is moving ahead. It figures to shore up Europe\u2019s access to gas, but also to grant Russia even more control over that access, something the US has pointed out as it opposed the project. (Recently, the Biden administration waived sanctions related to it, giving an effective green light, despite its concerns.) At the same time, Europe is forging ahead with a transition away from fossil fuels and toward clean, renewable energy sources. But that transition hasn\u2019t happened yet. As Europe looks for a bridge from dirtier sources like oil and coal, relatively clean natural gas is seen as a good fit. And for gas, Europe relies on imports \u2013 particularly from Russia. Vladimir Putin says Russia is not using energy as a weapon France, for instance, imports virtually all its natural gas. France is among the global leaders in nuclear technology, but Macron has previously pledged to rely on it less heavily. (Amid high energy prices and his looming reelection campaign, he has reneged on that a bit, promising swift new investments in nuclear, but nonetheless, it remains the case that Macron has committed that by 2035, France will rely on nuclear for no more than 50% of its power. That stands to boost the importance of gas.) Germany, too, is turning away from nuclear and is doing so even more quickly: Merkel\u2019s government has pledged to shutter all of Germany\u2019s nuclear plants by the end of next year. As Germany and France seek to reduce their reliance on nuclear energy, they\u2019ll likely turn to natural gas, at least until more wind and solar projects can be brought online. Putin, one might guess, is probably viewing this as a rare opportunity to exercise important politico-economic leverage. With Nord Stream 2 still in the works, Russia is already Europe\u2019s main gas supplier, accounting for 41% of its imports. A turn to gas by Europe, and a new pipeline to Russia to get it, only stands to boost Putin\u2019s power. Putin has already been quietly demonstrating just what life could be like for a continent that has become deeply, perhaps existentially, reliant on the Kremlin to supply its most critical energy needs. Russia is moving only limited quantities through the current pipeline system that transits Ukraine, and its state gas producer, Gazprom, is filling domestic stocks before replenishing storage sites in Europe. With energy prices rising and the global economy struggling to move forward after its post-2020 rebound, short gas supplies are already putting parts of Europe at risk of energy-driven stagflation. These pressures could very well intensify, providing a possible foretaste of what could be on the near-term horizon, until Europe manages a credible and sustainable transition to renewable energy. Putin would clearly see a completed EU transition away from gas, and toward renewables, as a looming threat to his influence. It\u2019s yet another reason for Putin to look to Nord Stream 2 to reap as much profit (financial and geopolitical) as possible before the EU can pull off its green conversion. From 'net zero' to 'mitigation,' here's how to sound smart on climate The US may not like the pipeline \u2013 former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called it a tool of Russian \u201ccoercion\u201d \u2013 but Washington probably can\u2019t do much about it. Having already irritated so many forces in Western Europe over a host of issues, including the US and NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan and the secretively crafted US-UK-Australia security partnership, the Biden administration must tread very carefully indeed. The US may have non-geopolitical reasons for opposing Nord Stream 2 \u2013 and it might have reason to see American-supplied natural gas as a possible answer for Europe. The United States remains the largest single supplier to Europe of liquefied natural gas, which can be shipped via tankers. Still, LNG is more expensive, relies on long-distance supply, and must be converted from liquid to gas on arrival. And there\u2019s already heavy competition from other regions, especially China, for LNG. Nord Stream 2 would result in a guaranteed supply of natural gas to Europe, presuming EU member states approve it in the next several months. So for Europe, it remains an appealing option. From the Russian perspective, there\u2019s another beauty to Nord Stream 2, beyond serving as a potentially cheaper competitor to American LNG: It could allow Russia to scale back dramatically its natural-gas shipments through the existing pipeline that passes through Ukraine and from which Kiev now receives transit fees. That could give Putin even freer rein in his rivalry with the determinedly pro-Western government of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who just this summer labeled Nord Stream 2 \u201ca dangerous geopolitical weapon.\u201d Russia\u2019s warnings to Europe could also be seen as a caution to the US to back off its determined opposition to Nord Stream 2 \u2013 and its opposition to Russia\u2019s broader efforts to form more binding ties to western Europe. Nord Stream is effectively a fait accompli. Still, the perceived American hostility to it could drive yet another wedge between Europe and America, at time when the Trump and now Biden administrations have done enough to degrade transatlantic ties. In that sense, the US should back off and let the pipeline proceed without much complaint. Until Europe breaks its reliance on fossil fuels and effects a green transition in full, Putin will keep an upper hand.",

View more opinion on CNN. In a widely circulated video from January 6, Paul Hodgkins stands on the floor of the Senate with the staff of his red Trump flag resting on his shoulder. He sports a moustache, a beard, and shoulder-length hair. His arms are protected by leathery cuffs like those sold with \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d costumes. Goggles dangle from his neck. Behind him, in the presiding officer\u2019s spot, half-naked Q-Anon Shaman Jacob Chansley, rants about \u201ccommunists and globalists within our government.\u201d Today, Chansley is a ward of the government, which is trying to determine if he\u2019s psychologically fit to face criminal charges. Hodgkins is the first of those federally charged in the Trumpist attack on the Capitol to be sentenced to prison. In the wake of his sentencing, we shouldn\u2019t overlook the fact that years of lies and propaganda issued by former President Donald Trump and others set the conditions for thousands of people to battle police until they gained control of the Capitol, driving senators, representatives and the Vice President out of their chambers and into hiding. \u201cWe were battling 15,000 people. It looked like a medieval battle scene,\u201d said police officer Michael Fanone, a week after the melee. He suffered a mild heart attack after being shocked by a stun gun. He heard someone shout, \u201cKill him with his own gun.\u201d The battle that terrified Fanone exhilarated many of the attackers, who seemed to feel as if they were engaging in dramatic patriotic action even if their grasp of the situation was shaky, as demonstrated by the Capitol rioter who thought he was in the White House. Another, who wore a gladiator costume, filmed himself saying, \u201cWow Mom. I wish you were here with me.\u201d It is in this feeling, and in the costuming and weaponry so many brought to the Capitol, that we can find clues to the enduring power of Trump. On January 6, the world saw people who felt called to action by a king-like figure who needed his political tribe\u2019s help to retore his rule. They responded as if they were part of a giant live action role playing (LARP) game, and not real-world people who would be held accountable. In a similar way, millions of Americans are now demonstrating their loyalty to Trump and their tribe by risking their lives, and the lives others, as they refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-19 \u2013 despite the fact that Trump himself reportedly received the vaccine in January. Vaccine skepticism has been a problem in Trump country as the government races to defeat the virus by using inoculation to achieve so-called \u201cherd immunity.\u201d   As president Trump had modeled anti-science skepticism by generally refusing to wear a face mask and ridiculing the top pandemic advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci. He held mass campaign rallies against expert advice, was so effective in politicizing the pandemic that even after he publicly agreed the vaccines were safe, his followers lagged in taking it. The first Capitol riot felony sentence was exactly the right call The bond Trump forged with his followers was created in large part by his appeal to their pre-existing resentment of elites, including experts on everything from climate change to medicine (Remember how he mused about treating Covid-19 infections with light and disinfectant?). Republicans have played this game for years, which may explain why GOP voters have far less confidence in science than Democrats. Indeed, as historian Naomi Oreskes noted recently, GOP spokespeople have criticized scientists for decades and even invented controversies to challenge experts on concerns such as climate change. With the pandemic the mindset created by the anti-expert drumbeat made it natural for Republican governors to resist scientists who called for life-saving measures like mask mandates for public spaces. In the case of vaccines, even the fact that they were developed with funds provided by the Trump administration doesn\u2019t seem to have much effect. A Washington Post-ABCNews poll released two weeks ago found that while 93 percent of Democrats either have gotten their shots or plan to, only 49 percent of Republicans fall into the same category. Although income was also related to attitudes about the shot, with less-wealthy people showing more skepticism, this factor was not nearly as important as was loyalty to the GOP and Trump. Anecdotally, it can seem as if vaccine resistance has become part of the culture of resentment that Trump exploited in his campaigns. After years of hearing their man demonize the media, Trump\u2019s followers may reflexively turn-out information that could save their lives. When political consultant Frank Luntz convened a focus group to discuss vaccines, one woman said, \u201cA lot of the hesitancy that\u2019s coming from the right is just from being bullied, being humiliated, basically, by the media,\u201d adding, \u201cI don\u2019t really see the point in getting it if nothing is going to change, and I haven\u2019t gotten sick.\u201d As regions of under-vaccinated Trump Country experience surges in cases, many in right-wing media are fighting against the government\u2019s best efforts to save people from a virus that has already killed 600,000 Americans.  Pro-Trump activist Charlie Kirk went on Fox News recently to compare vaccine guidelines to apartheid in South Africa.  Meanwhile Fox News opinion hosts have repeatedly misrepresented government policy as they have the vaccine effort. Though notably, Sean Hannity issued an impassioned plea Monday night for his viewers to take Covid seriously, and to consider taking the vaccine. Like supporting Trump\u2019s Big Lie that says the last election was stolen from him, opposition to the vaccine may be shaping up to be a requirement for those who would claim to remain on Team Trump.  That this stance requires taking a dramatic risk \u2013 one\u2019s own life \u2013 aligns with the type of thinking that led so many of his followers to heed his call to come to Washington, DC, and then attack the Capitol with the hope of stopping the final certification of the election results.  In both cases, Trumpists caught up in something akin to LARPing will inevitably encounter real life consequences in the form of prison terms, hospital stays, or even funerals.  Their enablers and defenders will want to blame Trump or argue that their only victims are themselves. Trump and his amen chorus obviously deserve real blame. But let\u2019s also recognize that the actions of these true believers have ripple effects: The nation was wounded by the January 6 attack and it suffers with every hospitalization and death of an unvaccinated Trump voter. Enough with the LARPing.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Twitter suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a conspiracy-mongering Republican congresswoman from Georgia, for 12 hours Monday night for continuing to spread dangerous misinformation about Covid-19, a company spokesperson told CNN. In recent days, the platform had labeled two of Greene\u2019s tweets as \u201cmisleading\u201d \u2013 if she persists in spreading lies, she could be suspended from the platform permanently. This was a good move on Twitter\u2019s part: tech companies need to do much more to prevent the dissemination of conspiracy theories, lies and the kind of false information that could have deadly consequences. But it\u2019s also a moment that reveals the real danger Americans are in right now. We shouldn\u2019t be at this juncture. Tech companies should not be, and cannot be, our last bulwark against the spread of deception, distortion, bigotry and incendiary political discord. And yet, with a Republican Party that refuses to police itself, a right-wing media apparatus that is more propaganda than news or journalism and a stubborn pro-Trump base willing to believe and parrot anything the former president says, American democracy \u2013 and truth itself \u2013 are in peril. That\u2019s an illness that tech companies like Twitter can only seek to contain; it\u2019s not a disease they can cure. Greene\u2019s Covid comments were so flatly wrong it\u2019s incredible that anyone trusts her with the basics of governance, but welcome to today\u2019s science-denying and fact-illiterate GOP. She tweeted \u2013 against all evidence \u2013 that Covid isn\u2019t dangerous for people who aren\u2019t obese and who are under 65. That is dangerously wrong: just ask the hundreds of thousands of non-obese people under 65 worldwide who have been seriously sickened by the virus \u2013 or the relatives of those who\u2019ve died. What anti-vaxxers sound like to me It is true that the risk of dying of Covid increases with age. But \u201celevated risk\u201d is not the same as \u201conly at risk.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time that Greene has used her platform to spread lies and conspiracies. She has indicated that she believes the QAnon conspiracy, a bizarre far-right lie that Democrats make up a cabal of cannibalistic pedophiles \u2013 a claim so outrageous and easily disproven that it would be funny if so many people didn\u2019t believe it (and if they weren\u2019t showing up to pizza places toting guns, or winning seats in Congress). Earlier this year, Greene took to Twitter to claim that there was widespread election fraud in 2020. Twitter suspended her for spreading election misinformation. In response, she complained that \u201cConservative Americans shouldn\u2019t be afraid to speak their mind. They shouldn\u2019t have to fear being cancelled by American corporations where they work, do business, and use services,\u201d she said. \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be scared into submission by Socialists who want to end their way of life.\u201d Phillip: Taylor Greene thinks anti-Semitic comments help her She had also compared Covid-related masking and other protective measures to Nazism. Though House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has called out some of her more egregious remarks, the GOP has never bothered to penalize Greene for her lies and bigoted comments in any lasting way.  Why would they? Their leader, still playing president in Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster, is making many of the same claims. Trump also insists the election was stolen \u2013 and his party has used those lies to try to limit the rights of voters to cast ballots. And when it comes to Covid, Trump has long been the denier-in-chief, downplaying the disease\u2019s risks \u2013 even after he contracted it.  Twitter\u2019s most striking moment in recent memory came when they removed Trump from their platform permanently after the January 6 insurrection. Trump and Greene invite a horrific history to repeat itself Social media companies increasingly police online speech, determining \u2013 vastly imperfectly \u2013 what is and is not acceptable in the public square. There are always going to be liars, charlatans, racists, ignorant people and people whose grasp on reality is tenuous as best. Social media companies have to decide what they will allow users to post to their platforms, and whatever lines they draw will by definition not exclude every bad thing. What\u2019s stunning about this moment, though, is that so much of the troubling misinformation isn\u2019t coming from fringe conspiracy theorists or random yahoos, but members in good standing of one of two of America\u2019s major parties. There may not be an easy way to keep all of the bad actors off of Twitter, but there should surely already be a mechanism in place to keep the reality-challenged out of elected office.  That would require the Republican Party to want their fringe members out of office, though. And it seems that as the fringes overtake the party itself, there\u2019s less and less pushback. And since the fringes joined forces long ago with Fox News to spawn a robust ecosystem of other far-right reality-challenged media, conservative voters don\u2019t seem to want to return to reason or even honesty \u2013 Greene not only won her election, she also raised an astonishing $3.2 million in just three months. Twitter is indeed the last wall of decency right now. And given how paper-thin it is, that\u2019s no comfort at all.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cThe past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u201d wrote William Faulkner in \u201cRequiem for a Nun.\u201d This week, a slew of bombshell books recounting the final days of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency crowded the headlines with jarring revelations from the recent past. And many Americans, weary of anxiety and sweltering through an overheated July, may have longed to ignore Faulkner \u2013 and reach instead for Don Henley\u2019s Grateful Dead-influenced counsel in \u201cThe Boys of Summer\u201d: \u201cDon\u2019t look back, you can never look back.\u201d If only that were possible. One reason it is neither possible nor prudent to ignore the past, argued Nicole Hemmer, is that Trump \u2013 his loss of the presidency and two impeachments notwithstanding \u2013 remains overwhelmingly influential in the Republican Party, even as shocking new videos of the January 6 insurrection he summoned emerge almost daily. The party has continued to protect him, linking its fortunes to his, she wrote, and sustaining his Big Lie \u2013 that he, and not President Joe Biden, actually was the winner of the 2020 election \u2013 as part of a dangerous effort to undermine our democracy by staying in power. She cited Michael Bender\u2019s assessment in \u201cFrankly, We Did Win this Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost,\u201d noting that \u201cTrump was not being buffeted by chaotic winds, but rather bubble-wrapped by a party that sought to protect his power, and theirs, at any cost. Every step of the way \u2026 Republicans stepped in to save him.\u201d Trump met Thursday at his New Jersey golf club with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has stalled on naming Republicans to serve on the Democratic-led House select committee to investigate the January 6 insurrection. Hemmer opined: \u201cMcCarthy\u2019s flip-flopping on the House select committee likely reflects not a wobbliness on support for Trump, but merely uncertainty over how best to protect him.\u201d Bender\u2019s book, Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cLandslide\u201d and Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker\u2019s \u201cI Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump\u2019s Catastrophic Last Year\u201d do reveal some alarming behind-the-scenes accounts of Trump\u2019s presidency; Julian Zelizer suggested that Republicans \u2013 and all Americans \u2013 should also see these books as more than an urgent reminder of recent tumultuous history. They\u2019re also an alarm bell for the future risks in returning Trump to power: \u201cAs GOP leaders lean into a potential second Trump election bid, they and all voters should be crystal clear about what they are signing up for if they stick with him.\u201d More smart takes: Michael D\u2019Antonio: The real reason Trump keeps telling the Big Lie Dean Obeidallah: This should be the only priority for Democrats Nowhere was the political rancor around getting \u2013 or even requiring \u2013 the Covid-19 vaccine on clearer display this week than in Tennessee, where health official Dr. Michelle Fiscus said she was fired after disseminating information about the legal rights of adolescents in that state to seek vaccination even without the support of their parents (she received a dog muzzle in the mail for her trouble). In a \u201csaner world,\u201d contended the Washington Post\u2019s Kathleen Parker, \u201cFiscus would be rehired soon with an apology \u2026 And those who lend legitimacy to the anti-vaccine cause on social media and flaky cable and radio programs would be face to face with unemployment.\u201d The state then confirmed its total shutdown of all vaccine outreach to adolescents. Jill Filipovic wrote that these events reinforce the enduring irony that the GOP, the \u201cpro-life\u201d party, doesn\u2019t believe that children or teens have basic rights to preserve their own well-being separate from their parents\u2019 wishes or consent: \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly striking about the current controversy in Tennessee is that the fired health official wasn\u2019t doing anything outside of the bounds of existing law \u2013 but the right-wing reaction to the very concept that teenagers might have some limited rights to bodily autonomy, coupled with the paranoid dogmatic rejection of vaccines, created a perfect storm of conservative outrage.\u201d Covid numbers are moving in the wrong direction in the US, and in much of the from the rest of the world. Raymond Joseph, who lives in Cape Town, shared his experience of being infected six weeks after being vaccinated and recovering after a \u201cmild\u201d \u2013 though alarming \u2013 bout of Covid. The shot, he wrote, may have saved his life: \u201cAt a time when the Delta variant is surging across the globe, someone like me who is vaccinated may be lulled into a false sense of safety, but in South Africa, where vaccinations rates have largely lagged, the threat remains quite high \u2013 and until vaccinations rates increase \u2013 extra precautions are needed.\u201d Dr. Jay Patel wrote that the decision to ban audiences at events during the upcoming Tokyo Olympics is wise, especially in a country with a high elderly population and slow vaccine rollout: \u201cAs the urgency of the pandemic fades in some parts of the world, in others, it has never been in greater need of attention. Allowing visitors to congregate in a country that has fallen behind on vaccinations and for which a large-scale outbreak would be disastrous and would be unnecessarily reckless.\u201d Further perspective on Covid: Dr. Tina Sacks: What anti-vaxxers sound like to me David A. Andelman: What\u2019s behind Macron\u2019s bold bet on a Covid health pass Ron Reynolds, a Democratic state representative in Texas, explained why he and dozens of his colleagues left their home state and flew to Washington, DC as Republicans\u2019 new restrictive voting bills were about to be voted on back home. Their move drew heat from critics on the right, but, he said the Texas Democrats all wanted Congress to hear from people who are on the frontlines, battling the anti-voter movement: \u201cWe were forced to flee Texas and have come to DC to ask our Congress to act now and pass both the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, [which] would strengthen the freedom to vote for all Americans.\u201d Texas political writer James C. Moore conceded that while Texans \u201crarely make nuanced political gestures,\u201d this is a critical moment both for his home state\u2019s Democrats and for the President. Biden gave a speech in support of voting rights in Philadelphia Tuesday in which \u201c[he] was also pushing new federal voting rights legislation, a move that can make his presidency appear weakened if he fails.\u201d MSNBC Daily\u2019s Joyce Vance argued Biden\u2019s speech didn\u2019t go far enough; he \u201cdidn\u2019t articulate a plan for moving past the biggest impediment to restoring voting rights: the 60-vote threshold created by the filibuster. That threshold is clearly unattainable in this current polarized moment. As long as the filibuster is honored, it will be impossible to pass the laws that are necessary to restore voting rights protections.\u201d Read more: Paul Begala: What the GOP is really after in Texas The Virgin Group founder\u2019s flight was a landmark moment for a fledgling space tourism industry soon to be further bolstered by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos\u2019s launch (scheduled for July 20) and Tesla mogul Elon Musk\u2019s pledge to be right behind him. But, as Holly Thomas maintained, \u201cdreaming big billionaire-style\u201d might come at a hefty price for the rest of us \u2013 at least in terms of environmental impact, a crucial concern at a time when the US West is enduring a heat wave some officials are calling a mass casualty event \u2013 and waste untold resources in a world suffering the ravages of poverty, disease and social injustice. SE Cupp took a different view, rejecting criticism of reporters covering Branson\u2019s journey. Dismissing Branson\u2019s accomplishment is a missed opportunity to savor the role of space in the American story, she argued. Reflecting on Walter Cronkite\u2019s emotional words of inspiration at the moment of the moon landing in 1969, Cupp urged media critics and other observers: \u201clet\u2019s be a little less cynical, remember our humility and rediscover our sense of adventure.\u201d Harsh temperatures and raging wildfires plague US Western states. Richard M. Frank wrote that the region is facing the punishing throes of a decades-long megadrought \u2013 \u201can era of water crisis that is unprecedented in recorded American history.\u201d Climate change is progressively worsening the drought conditions, he wrote, creating a horrific \u201cnew normal\u201d and rendering existing laws and policies determining water rights obsolete: \u201cGiven this reality, it\u2019s imperative that the American West modify its water policies without delay and implement more efficient methods of conserving and managing water.\u201d He explained just how. Writing in The New York Times and drawing from their recent paper in Science, Katharine J. Mach and A.R. Siders suggested that \u201cmanaged retreat\u201d \u2013 a purposeful move \u201caway from places threatened by floods, droughts, fires or high temperatures\u201d \u2013 should no longer be considered an extreme option or a \u201clast-ditch effort to flee climate problems. It should be a thoughtfully deployed tool for addressing a wide range of human problems.\u201d Another important view: Ban Ki-Moon and Patrick Verkooijen: The \u2018wet bulb\u2019 warning Amid historic protests in Cuba and growing chaos in the aftermath of the assassination of President Jovenel Moise in Haiti, pressure mounted from some quarters for the US to intervene in both countries. Dan Restrepo cautioned against such action: \u201cThe situations in Haiti and Cuba are complex and immune to the kind of bold action people so desperately want\u2026.The hard, simple truth is the United States is not going to be the primary engine of political change in either Haiti or Cuba. Meaningful, durable political change in both lies in the hands of the populations themselves.\u201d Reflecting on her own time reporting in Cuba, Frida Ghitis assessed the Cuban government\u2019s potential responses to the social unrest: calling out masses of government supporters to drown out their critics in the streets, acknowledge the island\u2019s problems while blaming them on the US and last, brute force. Thus far, Ghitis wrote, President Miguel Diaz-Canel, has done the first two in his televised response to the protest, but the last step will be harder \u2013 especially with the people\u2019s access to social media: \u201cThe more extensive the crackdown, the harder it is to defend its image as a government of and for the people. If we see much more violence at the hands of security forces, we will know authorities are deeply worried about losing control.\u201d More than a year after the murder of George Floyd touched off the Movement for Black Lives, lasting progress remains \u201chaltingly slow,\u201d  as Richard J. Reddick put it. In his analysis of Nikole Hannah-Jones\u2019 fight for tenure at the University of North Carolina, ESPN\u2019s Maria Taylor facing racist criticism from a White colleague and the House of Representatives vote (over some Republicans\u2019 objection) to remove Confederate statues from the US Capitol, Reddick noted that 125-year-old words from W.E.B. Du Bois \u201cstill resonate with Black Americans, too often asked to silence their voices in deference to White comfort. Du Bois related how simply existing as a Black person in America left one subject to \u2018double consciousness\u2019 \u2013 the sense of that perpetual uphill climb to prove one\u2019s worth, made while knowing that every stride forward will be scrutinized, second guessed or dismissed.\u201d In the world of sports, Peniel E. Joseph observed that this sense of \u201cdouble consciousness\u201d isn\u2019t limited to Black Americans: English soccer stars Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka were subjected to heinous racist abuse following their missed penalties in England\u2019s loss to Italy in the Euro Cup final. Joseph linked Du Bois to the statement of Black Formula One racing superstar Lewis Hamilton: that as a Black athlete, \u201csuccess feels like a double-victory, but a miss feels like a two-fold failure when it\u2019s compounded with racist abuse.\u201d Joseph observed that \u201caccording to this logic, the only way in the political and cultural imagination for Black athletes to win is to be perfect. When players of color like Rashford and his teammates make a misstep on the pitch \u2013 or show vulnerability off the court, as in the examples of Naomi Osaka or Serena Williams \u2013 the racialized responses from many fans and others in their sports reinforce this narrative.\u201d Daniella Zalcman: US begins its reckoning on Native American children Leon Panetta: The Afghanistan war lessons we cannot forget Mark Wolfe for CNN Business Perspectives: Rising gas prices will hurt low-income families the most.

From Black Widow\u2019s quest for redemption, to Harley Quinn\u2019s search for clemency in the latest \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d film, to the self-discovery journey of the series \u201cLoki,\u201d to a reexamination of identity in the CW\u2019s \u201cSuperman and Lois,\u201d Schwartz writes that superheroes\u2019 tendency to evolve and reflect the moment is \u201cwhy the 2021 summer offerings are heavy on antiheroes seeking their own reform, and why superheroes continue to resonate\u2026.They offer the great promise that we have not just the power to save the world, but the power to save ourselves.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In 2008, Brian Sicknick reached out to Sandra Garza on a dating site. She responded quickly and when they decided to date, \u201che made an odd request,\u201d Garza recalled: Could they meet for breakfast? It \u201cwas his favorite meal of the day, particularly blueberry pancakes \u2026\u201d \u201cBrian was very quiet, shy almost, and had an innocence about him that was incredibly endearing. We bonded over our love of animals, our military experience, and our passion for helping others \u2013 he as an officer, me as a clinical social worker.\u201d They soon moved in together, sharing holidays, vacations and agreeing politically: they were Trumpers. On the morning of January 6, Sicknick told Garza he would be policing the Capitol during expected pro-Trump protests. And she would be the person Capitol Police called after protesters stormed the Capitol and Sicknick was taken to the hospital, where he died the next day. When Garza saw the videos of the rioters brutalizing police officers, she kept thinking, \u201cWhere is the President? Why is it taking so long for the National Guard to arrive? Where is the cavalry?\u201d Garza has grown increasingly frustrated with Republicans who try to minimize the insurrection. \u201cTo know that some members of Congress \u2013 along with the former President, Donald Trump, who Brian and I once supported but who can only now be viewed as the mastermind of that horrible attack \u2013 are not acknowledging Brian\u2019s heroism that day is unforgivable and un-American.\u201d The reverberations of Trump\u2019s big lie \u2013 that the election was stolen from him \u2013 continue five months after he left the White House. But while he retains a strong hold on many Republicans, there are some signs of Trump\u2019s flagging influence. His hand-picked vice president, Mike Pence, said he will \u201calways be proud\u201d of playing his constitutional role in presiding over the congressional session that certified Joe Biden\u2019s victory, despite calls from Trump to block it. \u201cIf we lose faith in the Constitution, we won\u2019t just lose elections \u2013 we\u2019ll lose our country,\u201d Pence said in a speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. \u201cMike Pence is seizing his chance,\u201d wrote Michael D\u2019Antonio. \u201cAfter four humiliating years playing the role of the President\u2019s lap dog, which culminated in his fleeing a mob of Trump supporters, who threatened his life during the US Capitol attack on January 6, Pence seems to have begun his push to claim the presidency for himself.\u201d  CNN reported that Trump\u2019s endless complaints about the election\u2019s outcome are not sitting well even with his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Perry and about 30 other people, all vaccinated, gathered on a friend\u2019s patio for her birthday last month in Minnesota and got a chance to sing again. He started playing \u201cFive Days in May,\u201d by the Canadian band Blue Rodeo on his guitar. A few lines seemed perfect for this moment of emerging from pandemic into summer: \u201cSometimes the world begins to set you up on your feet again. It wipes the tears from your eyes \u2026\u201d Perry observed, \u201cWhen I don\u2019t play music with other people for a while, a part of me goes missing, my mental health frays, the world drags slowly down toward gray and it\u2019s harder for me to locate joy. But singing, specifically singing, emerged as a risk factor for the spread of Covid, so except for a few moments in one bubble or another, making music together vanished from my life.\u201d Roxanne Jones was lunching with a friend at a Brooklyn sidewalk caf\u00e9 when she heard the music down the street. A block party was in full swing, with songs like \u201cBefore I Let Go,\u201d by Frankie Beverly and Maze. \u201cAs I joined the crowd and got in sync, it felt as if the sun and the music were healing me, soothing the pain and loss I\u2019d suffered over for the last year,\u201d Jones wrote. \u201cI looked around and more than a few of us had tears in our eyes along with the smiles on our faces that even our masks couldn\u2019t hide. I\u2019ve never felt such gratitude in a crowd. That day in Bed-Stuy we danced till the sun went down, all of us grateful just to be alive.\u201d As Raul A. Reyes watched \u201cIn the Heights\u201d in a movie theater \u2013 the first time he\u2019s been to one in a year and a half \u2013 he thought of his Aunt Emma, who died of Covid-19 in January. \u201cMany of the characters reminded me of my own family. And I strongly sensed my Aunt Emma\u2019s presence; we had seen \u2018In The Heights\u2019 on Broadway together and she loved going to the movies. In some way, she was there with me in the theater. When the movie ended, the audience burst into applause. I did too, realizing it had been a long time since I\u2019d felt part of something joyous and communal.\u201d Kirsi Goldynia curated these thoughts \u2013 and a bunch of others \u2013 in a CNN Opinion roundup on the return of public life. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was sentenced to 22 and a half years in prison Friday for the murder of George Floyd. Legal analyst Elliot Williams has followed the case since the beginning, finding it a challenging \u2013 and wrenching \u2013 experience. \u201cBeyond my professional role, much of this story has been personal to me as a Black American man,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cFloyd\u2019s death was a public reminder of that which I\u2019m sure virtually every Black person in America is intimately aware: racism is real; inequities exist in the criminal justice system; even mundane encounters with law enforcement can quickly become deadly.\u201d Chauvin\u2019s sentence \u201cis a reminder of something that first got into my head as a young prosecutor: \u2018justice\u2019 is a relative concept. Over these months, I would cringe when I would see signs calling for \u2018Justice for George Floyd.\u2019 What would that even mean? Despite his 7-year-old daughter Gianna\u2019s heart-wrenching statement at the hearing about how Floyd lives on with her in spirit, no sentence can bring Floyd back to his family.\u201d It seemed like a return to the old world of Washington politics when President Joe Biden announced Thursday that the administration had struck a deal with Democratic and Republican senators for a $1.2 trillion bill to improve America\u2019s roads, bridges, transit, broadband and other physical infrastructure. \u201cThe news that members of both parties have come together to support critical priorities should be celebrated,\u201d wrote Lanhee J. Chen. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of throwback to the time when bipartisanship wasn\u2019t a dirty word and productivity was valued over ideology.\u201d In the New Yorker, Susan Glasser wrote, \u201cThis infrastructure deal proves Biden\u2019s theory of the case: that the elusive middle in American politics is alive, if often hardly in evidence.\u201d But, she added, \u201c\u2026 anything beyond this may well be impossible. The habit of taking what you can get and then voting yes has all but vanished. Permanent outrage is Congress\u2019s brand now, not perpetual compromise.\u201d And even the infrastructure plan\u2019s passage is not a sure thing. A lot more work has to be done to enact the bill into law, and it faces many potential hurdles \u2013 including the goals of progressive leaders who want to spend trillions more and raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy, a move Republicans are determined to resist. Will Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell try to dissuade GOP senators from handing Biden a victory in his quest for bipartisanship? Chen argued that the bipartisan plan announced this week is a \u201crare win-win\u201d and that \u201cboth sides stand to gain some political advantage from getting this deal through Congress and onto Biden\u2019s desk for his signature.\u201d  The infrastructure deal came two days after Senate Republicans blocked a sweeping voting rights bill that was a top priority for Democrats. The President had backed it but, as Frida Ghitis noted, \u201cmany were surprised when Biden didn\u2019t use every tool within his reach to push the voting rights bill known as the For the People Act\u201d and instead emphasized reaching a deal on infrastructure. Why? The odds were slim that anything Biden could have done would have swayed enough senators to pass the bill. But more significantly, Ghitis argued, \u201cBiden \u2026 is wagering that improving infrastructure, creating jobs and raising standards of living for the bulk of Americans will prove a more effective way to show democracy works than shifting procedures on how to vote. It\u2019s a gamble, and like every gamble, it may or may not pay off.\u201d In killing the For the People Act, Republicans certified their party as \u201cofficially anti-voting rights,\u201d wrote Rev. William Barber II, Barbara Arnwine, Penda Hair and Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. Democrats \u201cmust rise to meet the moral crises of our time, forgo the filibuster and pass generationally significant protections to rescue the promise of democracy.\u201d For more: James Moore: Why lawsuit-happy Texas Republicans win even when they lose Keith Boykin: Why Joe Manchin\u2019s voting rights proposal works for Stacey Abrams Heather Brandon-Smith and Diana Ohlbaum: Wars will last forever if Congress won\u2019t acknowledge they\u2019re over Rescuers searched for survivors after part of a 12-story beachfront apartment building north of Miami Beach collapsed in the early hours of Thursday; at least five people died and officials said more than 150 are unaccounted for. The cause was a mystery, Miami architect Kobi Karp pointed out. \u201cI was in high school in 1981, the year it was built,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIts concrete piles, shear walls and columns with floors of horizontal concrete slabs represented what has been the gold standard of coastal construction for more than 100 years.\u201d \u201cChamplain Towers was undergoing its 40-year building inspection at the time of the event, though documents have not yet been submitted to Surfside officials, according to the town clerk,\u201d Karp noted. \u201cAny information from that ongoing process may produce insights into the cause. To be certain, over the course of the days, weeks and months, forensic engineers will shed light on what went so terribly wrong.\u201d \u201cYou may not love me, but I love you\u201d was the card that Keith Magee\u2019s six-year-old son wrote to a classmate after he said he didn\u2019t want to sit next to him because he doesn\u2019t like \u201cboys with brown skin.\u201d Zayden Magee came up with the perfect response, but the whole experience weighed heavily on his father. \u201cI know that my child will probably one day look back on this incident as the first of many,\u201d Keith Magee wrote. \u201cHe will recognize it as marking the beginning of a lifetime of being the target of some people\u2019s hate because of the color of his skin. I know that his bafflement will turn to hurt and his hurt will turn to fear. I know he\u2019ll gradually lose his easily trusting nature and his expectation that he will be universally appreciated for being caring and funny and enthusiastic \u2013 just for being him. And I can\u2019t bear it.\u201d General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, served at multiple command and staff positions in eight divisions and special forces over nearly 40 years in the military, SE Cupp noted. But that didn\u2019t stop right-wing pundits and lawmakers from blasting his stance on race this week. \u201cMilley linked racism and extremism to the attack on the Capitol, and defended the notion that the military should explore and combat the racism and extremism within its ranks. He also took particular umbrage with the idea that doing so makes the military \u2018woke,\u2019 as some easily-offended right-wingers have complained.\u201d Britney Spears is asking a judge to end the conservatorship that has allowed her father, Jamie Spears, to exercise extreme control over her life since 2013. The conservatorship appears to be \u201coverly controlling,\u201d wrote Kara Alaimo, citing a New York Times report that Spears said she had been forced to go to a mental health facility and to perform with a 104-degree fever and that she has been limited in who she can date and even prevented from changing the color of her kitchen cabinets. \u201cThere\u2019s something arguably even more distressing here,\u201d Alaimo observed, \u201cthe fact that we know about it in the first place. The conservatorship itself and whether it remains or has ever been the proper course of action here center on Spears\u2019 mental health and finances. These are topics that she \u2013 and every woman (and man) \u2013 should have the right to keep private.\u201d Democratic voters in New York City went to the polls Tuesday to pick their choice for mayor. With the new ranked-choice voting system, the final results are expected to take weeks to tally. Nate Cohn of The New York Times summed it up in a tweet: \u201cThe NYC mayoral primary results page is live. Be sure to check back in a few weeks for the final result\u201d Whoever ultimately wins, one thing is clear \u2013 voters went for moderate candidates over progressives by a large margin, wrote John Avlon. \u201cThe clear leader at this point, Eric Adams, is a former police officer and current Brooklyn Borough President who promised to be tough on crime, rejecting calls to \u2018defund the police.\u2019 That message resonated because violent crime is on the rise in New York City, as it is in many cities across the country. Last year, the city saw a 97% increase in shootings and a 45% rise in murder, and crime has continued to spike in 2021.\u201d \u201cThe political appeal of touting \u2018law and order\u2019 is clear,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer. But he cautioned Democrats that retreating from reforming the criminal justice system would be a mistake. \u201cIn the end, the nation must realize that true \u2018law and order\u2019 depends on racial justice.\u201d For more: Jill Filipovic: New Yorkers flummoxed by a new way of picking their mayor Lincoln Mitchell: The reason Andrew Yang\u2019s mayoral campaign failed Afghanistan\u2019s top two government officials visited the White House Friday to make their case for aid as the US pulls its remaining troops out of the country. They\u2019re right to be concerned, wrote Peter Bergen. \u201cTheir country is in danger of being swallowed up by the Taliban,\u201d he noted, citing a report that the \u201cTaliban are in a stronger military position now than at any point since 2001,\u201d when the war began after the 9/11 terror attacks on the US. America \u201chas contributed to the deteriorating security situation by consistently saying for more than a decade that it is leaving Afghanistan, which has undermined the Afghan government and strengthened the resolve of the Taliban, who have won at the negotiating table from the Americans what they failed to win on the battlefield,\u201d Bergen noted. \u201cWithout swift action by the Biden administration, we could see in Afghanistan a remix of the disastrous US pullout from Saigon in 1975 and the summer of 2014 in Iraq, when ISIS took over much of the country following the US pullout from the country three years earlier. That withdrawal was negotiated by then-vice president Biden.\u201d Jeff Pearlman: The big problem with the NCAA ruling Allison Hope: Carl Nassib\u2019s openness flips the script Father Edward Beck: The big question for Catholic bishops is not really about Joe Biden and Communion Scott Jennings: Removing Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s statue is the worst kind of pandering Ronald Zambrano: How \u2018red flag\u2019 laws could prevent workplace shootings Imara Jones: My life growing up Black and trans in 1980s Atlanta David A.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN. Watch Garza in conversation with Anderson Cooper on AC360 Wednesday at 8 PM ET. In late 2008, while on a popular dating site, I received a message in my inbox from a good-looking, dark-haired man with gorgeous blue eyes saying, \u201cHi, how are you?\u201d I responded, and before I knew it, we were chatting regularly for weeks. He told me that he used to be in the Air National Guard, was originally from New Jersey, and was nearing the end of his training to be a US Capitol Police Officer. It was Brian D. Sicknick. When we finally were ready to meet for our first date, he made an odd request. Meet for breakfast? I came to learn that breakfast was his favorite meal of the day, particularly blueberry pancakes. Brian was very quiet, shy almost, and had an innocence about him that was incredibly endearing. We bonded over our love of animals, our military experience, and our passion for helping others \u2013 he as an officer, me as a clinical social worker. Soon, we moved in together \u2014 for 11 years, through the good, the bad and the ugly, the belly laughs, birthdays, Thanksgivings, Christmases, road trips, vacations, heartbreaking losses and moves to new homes. Last July we took a break from our relationship to figure out our futures. He kept our dachshunds; I babysat them when he worked late. We remained incredibly close. On the morning of January 6, 2021, Brian reminded me that I needed to stay overnight to be with the dachshunds because there were pro-Trump protests happening over the outcome of the election. He said he would not be coming home until late the following day. I was busy at work, so I didn\u2019t follow the news that day. Then Brian\u2019s mother, Gladys, called me \u2014 frantic \u2014 asking me to get in touch with him. \u201cThere is something going on at the Capitol,\u201d she said. I assumed it was nothing serious; over our 11 years, it was not uncommon for something to be going on at his job \u2014 and Brian was always OK. I reached out and asked him to contact his mother. He did and I went back to my work. Later that evening, the call came: the worst phone call of my life. It was from a US Capitol Police Officer who told me that Brian was in the hospital. I couldn\u2019t comprehend what I was hearing.  He said he would send an officer to my house. As I waited on pins and needles, I was finally met by a Virginia state trooper who could give me no information about what had happened to Brian. She escorted me to the hospital. When I arrived at the ER, there was no one there to greet me. I told a woman behind a desk why I was there. She asked me to sign in and sit down. I explained the severity of the situation, trying my best to remain calm. Thankfully, the kindness of the state trooper helped ground me in a very agonizing, frustrating moment. Eventually, I was greeted by the ER physician who told me the terrible news that Brian was on a ventilator and I could not see him because of Covid restrictions. I notified Brian\u2019s mother, who immediately drove with her sister to the hospital. They also were not allowed to see Brian. The rest of his family soon arrived. Brian died the next day. In the days after his death, I was further shocked and saddened to learn Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood and DC Police Officer Jeffrey Smith had died by suicide.  Devastated over the loss of Brian and drowning in grief, I took two months off from work. There were times I didn\u2019t want to get up in the morning, didn\u2019t want to face my life without Brian in it. I also did not watch any of the January 6 footage because I had heard so many terrible things about it and didn\u2019t think I could psychologically handle it. But before his memorial a month later, something came over me: I wanted to see everything I could and understand what happened that day. As I watched the videos, I couldn\u2019t believe my eyes. I saw officers being brutalized and beaten, and protesters defying orders to stay back from entering the Capitol. All the while, I kept thinking, \u201cWhere is the President? Why is it taking so long for the National Guard to arrive? Where is the cavalry!?\u201d As the months passed, my deep sadness turned to outright rage as I watched Republican members of Congress lie on TV and in remarks to reporters and constituents about what happened that day. Over and over they denied the monstrous acts committed by violent protesters. I was further angered when Officer Billy Evans was killed in early April at the Capitol, rammed by a driver at the North barricade of the Capitol Complex. The assailant, who was killed by police, reportedly struggled with mental health issues and was not apparently part of the January 6 riot, though he held strong political ideologies, his family said. But it felt very much to me that the attack and Officer Evans\u2019 death was directly related to the events of January 6, that people were newly emboldened to vent their life frustrations with the government by attacking innocent officers who diligently protect the Capitol daily.  Still, I kept largely silent out of respect for Officer Evans\u2019 family. When I learned of the proposal to create a January 6 commission to investigate the attack, and understood the importance of what this bill would accomplish, I finally felt compelled to speak out, along with Gladys, to encourage the Republican Senators to vote yes. I knew it would not be comfortable or easy being in the public eye, but my desire for justice outweighed any discomfort I felt. As we went door to door to their offices several weeks ago ahead of the vote, some Republican senators were very pleasant and polite. Others were dismissive, and others could barely hide their disdain. Since those meetings, only a handful of Republican senators showed that they possessed the moral compass to do the right thing by voting yes, putting America first, and showing warmth and compassion for the officers (as well as their families) who protect them daily. By denying or downplaying the viciousness and trauma that occurred on January 6, members of Congress and the people who continue echoing their false narrative are engaging in a specific kind of psychological harm that is familiar to people who work in mental health. It\u2019s known as \u201csecondary wounding.\u201d Secondary wounding, described by psychologist Aphrodite Matsakis, occurs when people \u201cminimize or discount the magnitude of the event, its meaning to the victim, [or] its impact on the victim\u2019s life.\u201d Make no mistake: All of the officers and people who were physically harmed, terrified, psychologically destabilized or lost loved ones due to that day are literally being re-traumatized every time someone speaks untrue words to describe what happened on January 6. For those lawmakers who voted no, I will continue to speak out to remind them and those Americans who support them, of the horrors of that day and the trauma that continues in the minds of those that suffered in the battle in the very seat of American democracy. This not only includes the officers, but fellow senators and congressmen and women, as well as the innocent employees who were in the Capitol that day who were terrified and wondered if they, too, would make it home that day. Brian was a proud American and loved his country. He continued his service long after his time in the military by becoming a US Capitol Police Officer, serving the American people and members of Congress  \u2013 and protecting democracy. To know that some members of Congress \u2014 along with the former President, Donald Trump, who Brian and I once supported but who can only now be viewed as the mastermind of that horrible attack \u2014 are not acknowledging Brian\u2019s heroism that day is unforgivable and un-American.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Gulnoza Said is the Europe and Central Asia program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. The arrest of Belarusian journalist and activist Roman Protasevich on Sunday should not have come as a surprise to anyone following events in the former Soviet republic. We at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) have been documenting for a year the arrests, imprisonment, beatings and other violations of reporters who were persecuted in that country simply for doing their job. Yet even knowing what we did of the situation, the action to divert a Ryanair Athens-Vilnius flight to the Belarus capital of Minsk \u2013 where Protasevich was detained \u2013 is shocking. Europe\u2019s last dictator, Aleksander Lukashenko, has long been an enemy of independent media. Last year, he stepped up censorship after claiming victory in the contested presidential election of August 9 \u2013 a claim widely seen as fraudulent and which set off a wave of giant protests. Protasevich was the co-founder of NEXTA, one of the most popular channels on the Telegram messaging app and a leading source of information on the anti-Lukashenko protests. The international community has rightfully cried foul, with some airlines now avoiding Belarus air space and activists in Belarus and abroad urging democratic foreign governments and international organizations to punish the Lukashenko regime. Meanwhile, my focus remains on trying to get information about whether Protasevich is OK, whether he has a lawyer and whether his rights are being violated in detention. On Monday, the journalist\u2019s mother, Nataliya Protasevich, told CPJ that she learned from an unnamed source that her son was taken to a hospital because of his chronic heart condition. (Nataliya Protasevich told us she did not want to identify that person out of fear for their safety.) Detained Belarusian dissident appears in video as fury mounts over 'hijacking' of Ryanair flight Later, a 29-second video emerged on the pro-government Telegram channel Zhyoltiye Slivy showing Protasevich saying that Belarusian authorities are treating him \u201ccorrectly\u201d and \u201clawfully.\u201d Protasevich, who appears to have bruises or scuff marks on his face, says in the video \u2013 headlined \u2018I confess\u2019 \u2013 that he does not have any health issues and added that he is being held in the Minsk pre-trial detention center #1. Protasevich also said that he is \u201ccooperating with investigators and continue(s) confessing to organizing mass riots in the city of Minsk.\u201d Belarusian authorities said last November that the charges against him included \u201corganizing mass riots\u201d and \u201cgroup activities that grossly violate public order.\u201d Sviatlana Tikhanouvskaya, a Belarusian opposition leader and a 2020 presidential candidate, said in a tweet that Protasevich faced the death penalty. Protasevich\u2019s detention came soon after the May 18 raid and shutdown of another major online media outlet, Tut.by. and detentions of at least 10 of its staff, including three journalists. Its chief editor Maryna Zolatava remains in jail on what we believe are spurious tax evasion charges and could face up to 10 years in prison if found guilty. On May 19, Tut.by correspondent Katsiaryna Barysevich was released from prison after serving six months for reporting on protests in November \u2013 only to learn that her colleagues were in jail and her media outlet was shuttered. On May 21, Belarusian authorities raided the studios of another prominent media outlet \u2013 Belsat, a Poland-based satellite broadcaster, which has also been reporting on anti-Lukashenko protests. Two of its journalists \u2013 reporter Katsiaryna Andreyeva and camerawoman Daria Chultsova \u2013 are serving two-year sentences for providing live coverage of protests in November. Belarus' outrageous 'hijacking' needs serious, swift consequences Before his May 23 arrest, Protasevichwas running a Telegram channel called Belarus golovnogo mozga \u2013 Belarus of the Brain \u2013 after founder Ihar Losik was arrested before the August elections; he too is facing years in prison. Losik, who was also a consultant for the US. Congress-funded broadcaster Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, survived what his wife told Russia\u2019s independent Novaya Gazeta were suicide attempts earlier this year and went on hunger strike trying to draw attention to his plight. Belarusian independent media have never been allowed to operate freely but managed to develop despite the hurdles the regime created since Lukashenko came to power in 1994. Imprisonments of critics and opponents are not new tactics: he used them in previous elections, and in the months and weeks before the 2020 vote by jailing the main candidates for the presidency. Now, Pratasevich\u2019s life could be in danger and the survival of independent media as a whole is at stake. Many journalists who are not in jail fled Belarus and are trying to find ways and funding to continue journalism from abroad. Those remaining in Belarus have to work under constant pressure of the state censorship machine that just demonstrated for them that even flying over Belarus could land them in Lukashenko\u2019s cells. The world community must respond to Lukashenko\u2019s single-handed raising of the stakes on Sunday.  Governments should impose strictly targeted sanctions against government officials of all levels \u2013 from Lukashenko to prison guards known for brutal treatment of journalist inmates, as well as against state-owned companies and Lukashenko cronies inside and outside the country. Belarus has strong political, economic and security ties with Russia, and some observers believe Russia\u2019s FSB helped Belarus\u2019 KGB in the operation to arrest Pratasevich. (Russian Presidential Spokesperson Dmitriy Peskov refused to comment on the RyanAir diversion on Monday, according to the Russian state agency Interfax. When asked about whether Russian special services were involved in the operation, he said \u201cThis is the last thing I\u2019d like to comment on.\u201d) Providing support to in-country and exiled media outlets, journalists, press freedom and human rights organizations is the only way to guarantee we can continue to receive objective information about media crackdowns and human rights violations in Belarus. But first and foremost, world leaders must demand the immediate and unconditional release of Protasevich and all other journalists in Belarusian jails.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Elliot Williams is a CNN legal analyst. He is a former deputy assistant attorney general at the Justice Department and a principal at The Raben Group, a national public affairs and strategic communications firm. Follow him on Twitter @elliotcwilliams. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. It\u2019s a free country, and people are entitled to hold whatever wacky views they want. However, when those people are, say, married to a sitting Supreme Court justice, they shouldn\u2019t be surprised if expressing those views comes with a serious cost. Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s wife, Ginni, put that notion to the test this week. According to The Washington Post, early in the morning on Jan. 6, Thomas urged her Facebook followers to watch the news of that day\u2019s pro-Trump rally at the Capitol on conservative media sites. \u201cLOVE MAGA people!!!!\u201d she wrote. Later, she sent more encouragement: \u201cGOD BLESS EACH OF YOU STANDING UP or PRAYING.\u201d Then, as thousands of pro-Trump rioters overran the Capitol, and things took a deadly turn she likely didn\u2019t anticipate, Thomas is reported to have added, \u201c[Note: written before violence in US Capitol].\u201d House Republicans flinched before Marjorie Taylor Greene [My note in response: If you have to update your social media posts to distance yourself from seditionist chaos at events you knowingly promoted, it\u2019s time to stop promoting such events. Or rethink your views.] Thomas\u2019s behavior exposes two things: how fringe views have now eclipsed mainstream conservative thought in America; and how weak the standards are for policing the conduct of Supreme Court justices and their spouses. Thomas\u2019s recent posts \u2013 and other political conduct \u2013 rankled some of her husband\u2019s former staff members who belong to a private \u201cThomas Clerk World\u201d email list, according to the Post report. Ms. Thomas sent a lengthy apology to the list, writing that \u201cMy passions and beliefs are likely shared with the bulk of you, but certainly not all\u2026Let\u2019s pledge to not let politics divide THIS family, and learn to speak more gently and knowingly across the divide.\u201d She continued that \u201cI would ask those of you on the contrary side to have grace and mercy on those on my side of the polarized world.\u201d Gentleness, grace and mercy are noble sentiments. But Thomas is being disingenuous. She has a long history of incendiary rhetoric, particularly online.  Was she really \u201cspeaking knowingly and gently across the divide\u201d last summer, when she referred to the Black Lives Matter protesters as \u201cradical extremists\u201d who \u201chate America\u201d? Was she attempting to heal the \u201cpolarized\u201d world when regularly sharing baseless memes accusing Democrats of engaging in \u201ca silent coup\u2026against the very premises of our constitutional republic,\u201d advancing the anti-Semitic trope of a Democratic Party run by the Soros family? When she speaks of her \u201cside\u201d is she speaking about the one that showed up at the Capitol building armed with nooses, gallows and riot gear, calling out threats for members of Congress they said they wanted to punish, and trashing the seat of our democracy? Or is she talking about some other side? Is the rhetoric from a Justice's wife too far right? Notably absent from Ginni Thomas\u2019s finger-wagging about healing and pleas for mercy is a renunciation of the view that got us here in the first place: The lie that somehow the 2020 election was stolen and that it is an act of patriotism to continue to challenge it. It is a little rich, in the week that a Capitol Police officer who gave his life on Jan. 6 lay in honor at the Capitol Building, for a leading combatant in the cooked-up culture wars to have a sudden epiphany about the need for civility in government. Even worse, however, is the fact that no matter how far his wife takes her antics, Justice Thomas will likely not face any real repercussions for it. Under federal law, justices must recuse themselves from cases in which their \u201cimpartiality might reasonably be questioned,\u201d or where their spouse has \u201can interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome.\u201d However, such recusals almost never happen on the Supreme Court. The reality is that while Congress can impeach justices for egregious conduct \u2013 a step not taken since 1805 \u2013 there is no real mechanism for enforcing ethical rules against them. Some of the most glaring examples of the current legal order\u2019s failure to hold justices accountable for conflicts of interest involve the Thomases themselves. In 2011, the justice refused to recuse himself from consideration of cases around the Affordable Care Act, despite his wife\u2019s extensive work as a lobbyist arguing for a full repeal of the law. He ultimately voted for its full repeal. Worse, it is hard to know exactly how lucrative the work was at the time for the Thomases, in part because the lobbying organization she established, Liberty Central, was able to take unlimited secret donations. Such donations, incidentally, were made possible by the court\u2019s ruling in Citizens United v. Federal Elections Commission, which Justice Thomas joined, arguing that the court should have been even more permissive in tolerating such donations than his fellow conservative colleagues ruled. (At the time, counsel for Liberty Central told the New York Times that it had \u201cinternal reviews and protections to ensure that no donor causes a conflict of interest for either Ginni or her husband.\u201d The Supreme Court public information office said she had consulted the court\u2019s legal office on her involvement with Liberty Central when it launched, but it declined to provide the Times more information.) If the Thomases\u2019 having possible financial conflicts of interest in matters before the justice wasn\u2019t sufficient to warrant his recusal from cases, certainly his wife\u2019s repeated pushing of conspiracy theories and publicly inserting herself into partisan matters won\u2019t either. Justice Thomas is far from the only justice in recent memory to have gotten away with conduct that stepped close to, if not over, commonsense ethical lines. For instance, in 2017, Justice Neil Gorsuch raised eyebrows by giving a keynote address at the Trump International Hotel in Washington \u2013 a venue whose revenue went, in part, to the sitting President of the United States. And in 2004, the late Justice Antonin Scalia was confronted with questions about whether to recuse from a matter involving former Vice President Dick Cheney, with whom he had recently gone duck hunting. Scalia responded that there was nothing suspect about his socializing with executive branch officials, famously closing with the quip, \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say for now. Quack, quack.\u201d  Part of the problem is that the Supreme Court can be hard to regulate. It starts and ends with a philosophical question: What is the court with the authority to judge the members of the highest court in the land? None exists in the Constitution, largely leaving the members to police themselves. Members of Congress have called for tougher ethical standards for justices, and advocates have pushed for an ethical code of conduct to apply to their behavior. These can\u2019t come quickly enough. Until then, we\u2019ll just have to tolerate whatever ridiculous and unethical behavior justices and their spouses engage in \u2013 and will have to listen to them lecture us about mercy and tolerance when they realize they\u2019ve gone too far.",

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) After weeks of warnings about the growing dangers of coronavirus variants, the Delta variant may be responsible for a six-fold increase in hospitalizations in one Missouri city. A hospital CEO in Springfield said most new patients there are unvaccinated and appear to have not observed basic pandemic precautions. Health experts worry more local spikes like this could be on the horizon. We\u2019re now about two weeks away from the Biden administration\u2019s self-imposed July 4 deadline to reach a 70% partial vaccination rate among US adults. And while the reported 65.4% seems promising, vaccination rates have slowed to a crawl. Meanwhile, vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are set to meet tomorrow\u00a0to discuss a handful of reports linking treatable heart inflammation to the coronavirus vaccine in youths and young adults. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. The Supreme Court unanimously handed down a huge ruling yesterday, saying student athletes can receive education-related payments. The case could reshape college sports by allowing more money from a billion-dollar industry to go to the players. In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the NCAA is essentially acting \u201cabove the law\u201d in how it treats athletes in forbidding them from making money off their college fame. The ruling is the first time in decades the Supreme Court has considered the issue, and it is an enormous win for a class of students who have said they were being exploited. The NCAA had argued the spending caps at issue were needed to preserve a distinction between amateur and pro sports. Lawmakers are set to resume tense negotiations over voting rights, infrastructure and police reform during an important week for President Biden\u2019s legislative goals. Biden met privately yesterday with two Democrats \u2013 Sens. Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin \u2013 who are crucial players in the President\u2019s push for his $4 trillion economic agenda. Today, the Senate is set to vote on whether to advance the sweeping elections reform bill. But without Republican support, Democrats are poised for a stinging defeat. However, there could be a silver lining if Democrats stay united and create a clear contrast between their voting priorities and Republicans\u2019. As for police reform, a key GOP legislator said it\u2019s \u201cJune or bust.\u201d The Senate heads into a July 4 recess at week\u2019s end, which could kill burgeoning momentum on the issue. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. New York City is now the largest US jurisdiction to implement ranked-choice voting as the city\u2019s primary elections get underway today. Under this system, voters rate their top five choices in order of preference instead of picking just one \u2013 a change that allows the city to avoid separate runoff elections in crowded mayoral primaries in which no one is expected to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. (The November general election will use a standard ballot.) The problem? It could take weeks to learn the full results. Thirteen Democrats and two Republicans are running in the mayoral primaries; they include former 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang and New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer. Other decisions on the ballot, like for a new Manhattan district attorney, could have wide-ranging political consequences. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The United States, European Union, United Kingdom and Canada rolled out fresh sanctions on Belarus yesterday in a coordinated response to President Alexander Lukashenko and his government\u2019s forced landing last month of a Ryanair flight and subsequent arrest of an opposition journalist. Dozens of people and entities are affected by the sanctions, which include US visa restrictions on 46 officials. The flight diversion and arrest of journalist Raman Pratasevich sparked international outcry. Pratasevich\u2019s appearances on Belarusian state TV since then have prompted opposition members and observers to suggest he showed signs of being tortured. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

            "article_content": "The devastation from this weekend\u2019s tornadoes was a stark reminder of the future that awaits humans on this planet, when weird weather is increasingly unpredictable and severe. But President Joe Biden \u2013 whose climate change initiatives in his social spending package face an uncertain future in the Senate \u2013 has more immediate political problems, including that high gas prices and inflation have eaten into his political power. The existential threat of our lifetime is running, again, into the political realities of our democracy. That the clock is ticking to address climate change has been broadcast on repeat, with increasing intensity. But as those alarm bells ring, so do warnings about continued threats to the republic, nearly a year after rioters stormed the US Capitol, as well as threats to American pocketbooks in the thick of the holiday season, thanks to the ongoing pandemic that continues to disrupt so much of the global system and threaten public health. Every day is a dizzying onslaught of headlines drowning out the perpetual threat of climate change until a severe weather event like this weekend\u2019s resurfaces the discussion. Why extreme weather might be our new normal \u201cThis is going to be the new normal,\u201d FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper Sunday, talking about extreme weather in general. \u201cThe effects that we\u2019re seeing from climate change are the crisis of our generation.\u201d To be clear, we don\u2019t know that climate change was responsible for the tornadoes; research on the role that climate change is playing in the formation and intensity of tornadoes is not as robust as for other types of extreme weather like droughts, floods and even hurricanes. But extreme weather is here to stay. It goes beyond the odd fact of snow in Hawaii this month, but little in Denver. Floods and wildfires are getting worse. The devastation in Kentucky suggests tornadoes could be in the mix. The solution for the world is cutting down on carbon emissions. The solution for Biden, although he has little control over it, includes lower gas prices. It is an irony of crosscurrents when the President\u2019s political fortunes rest on enabling something shown to affect the climate. The coronavirus pandemic \u2013 the headline that has consumed Americans for much of the past nearly two years \u2013 shows just how difficult it is for government to compel behaviors that could alleviate the threat. Among fierce disagreement over vaccine mandates, Americans are going to have to learn to live with the coronavirus, in part because more people won\u2019t get vaccinated on their own. Similarly, Americans may have to learn to live with a more unpredictable and dangerous climate because the wonky federal system is making it extremely difficult to deal with it in a big way. Biden wants the Environmental Protection Agency to weigh in on the specifics of the climate and tornadoes. \u201cAll that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet and the climate change,\u201d Biden said at the White House Saturday. \u201cThe specific impact on these specific storms, I can\u2019t say at this point. I\u2019m going to be asking the EPA and others to take a look at that.\u201d As CNN\u2019s climate team notes, the short and small scale of tornadoes, along with an extremely spotty and unreliable historical record for them, makes relationships to long-term, human-caused climate change very difficult to pinpoint. Criswell said tornadoes do occur in December. What\u2019s different in Kentucky is how the tornadoes behaved. \u201cAt this magnitude I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen one this late in the year,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also historic \u2013 even the severity and the amount of time these tornadoes spent on the ground is unprecedented.\u201d Many elements of Biden\u2019s climate agenda are in the Build Back Better bill, which faces uncertainty on Capitol Hill. It would invest billions in pushing the use of more clean and renewable energy to meet Biden\u2019s goal of a carbon pollution-free power sector by 2035. It would spend billions more to subsidize Americans buying electric cars and bikes. The climate portions, pared back to satisfy Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, are wrapped in with unrelated social safety net elements he doesn\u2019t yet support. How the climate crisis is affecting tornadoes Democrats put all their proposals \u2013 climate and otherwise \u2013 into one single bill to make an end-run around filibustering Republicans and exploit budget rules. It\u2019s a risky strategy that could leave the country without a new climate strategy if Manchin, who represents a state steeped in its history as a coal producer, doesn\u2019t come on board. But in a 50-50 Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris breaks ties, Democrats don\u2019t have any votes to spare, the West Virginia senator has enormous clout. While working with that narrow margin, Biden must fight the perception that his efforts to remake the social safety net are helping drive up costs. There are signs that supply chain kinks could be easing, and gas prices have already begun to fall, but those realities have not yet entered the public consciousness. The government report that tracks consumer prices registered a 39-year high for inflation when data for November was released Friday. More than two-thirds of Americans \u2013 69% \u2013 disapprove of Biden\u2019s handling of inflation and 57% disapproves of his handling of the economic recovery, according to a new ABC/Ipsos poll. The perceived squeeze on Americans\u2019 pocketbooks already overshadows the climate, but there\u2019s another distraction in the blinking-red threat to American democracy posed by former President Donald Trump and his allies. The latest revelation: Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, said in an email that the National Guard would be on hand to \u201cprotect pro Trump people\u201d in the leadup to the Capitol insurrection, according to a new contempt report released Sunday night by the House select committee investigating January 6. Meadows said National Guard would be ready to 'protect pro Trump people' before Capitol insurrection, House investigators say The resolution comes after the panel informed Meadows last week that it had \u201cno choice\u201d but to advance criminal contempt proceedings against him given that he had decided to no longer cooperate. The House earlier pursued a similar effort against Trump\u2019s informal adviser, Steve Bannon. His trial will get under way this summer, putting the high-profile case front-and-center as the 2022 midterm campaign is full swing. After earlier agreeing to cooperate with the committee, Meadows has clammed up, and sued House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and committee members, asking a federal court to block enforcement of the subpoena the committee issued him as well as the subpoena it issued to Verizon for his phone records. But the former North Carolina congressman had already handed over about 6,000 pages of documents, including information from his personal email account and personal cell phone, to the committee. That also included a PowerPoint document detailing ways to undermine the count of the 2020 election. A lawyer for Meadows said the former White House chief of staff was the recipient of the 38-page document but did nothing with it, according to the New York Times on Friday. CNN has not independently verified the contents of the PowerPoint. Democrats want to cram their massive climate change and safety net bill into law using budget rules. Republicans did the same to pass massive tax cuts in 2017. To control budget estimates, they push proposals on a temporary basis and then assume Americans won\u2019t want to give up the new perk. Republicans did that with their tax cuts for individuals, which are technically set to expire in 2025, but expected to be extended for most people. Democrats are following suit with their social spending bill. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said it would cost more than $3 trillion over 10 years if the programs were enacted permanently. Democrats say they will offset the programs in the future. Wherever the evolving form of American government throws up roadblocks, politicians will ultimately find ways around, but whether it\u2019s fast enough to address climate change is a question whose time has come.",

            "article_content": "Republicans seeking to energize their core voters and appeal beyond their base to others concerned about the fragile economic recovery are turning to the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine mandates. With more than 70% of adult Americans now fully vaccinated, Republicans are advocating for a slender minority of Americans as they champion the rights of the unvaccinated. It\u2019s a group dominated by voters within their base, which is why objections to federal mandates have become a key talking point for several potential 2024 hopefuls as they make the case that government overreach under Biden knows no bounds and must be stopped. But it\u2019s a messaging strategy that\u2019s gone beyond the Covid-19 culture wars, as Republicans warn that the rules will lead to lost jobs, economic disruptions and further labor shortages. The GOP\u2019s performance in Virginia and New Jersey last week, for example, raised the question of whether opposition to mandates \u2013 when framed around that overreach argument \u2013 could have wider appeal as the party tries to win back the House and Senate next year. Covid-19 vaccine debate takes a strange turn The lack of mass firings thus far due to vaccine requirements has not stopped Republicans from conjuring up potential doomsday scenarios for when the federal mandates go into effect. Echoing the party\u2019s rhetoric against mask mandates, some GOP lawmakers have said vaccine requirements trample on individual liberties. But they are also appealing to the many voters who remain anxious about the economic recovery as they warn of potential staffing disruptions and more limited availability of health care services, in addition to the ripple effect that could be caused by workers losing their jobs. \u201cLet\u2019s be clear \u2013 because it\u2019s easy to play this as a two-dimensional morality play. I\u2019m pro vaccine,\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said at the Republican Jewish Coalition conference last weekend, noting that he and his family have been vaccinated. \u201cBut I also believe in individual freedom and responsibility. I think it should be your choice what health care you get. You ought to be able to decide with your doctor.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of Democrats who are willing to be petty tyrants,\u201d he said, arguing that was a factor in Republican gains on election night last week. \u201cJoe Biden and Kamala Harris seem to want to double down on that, which is going to result in \u2013 next year \u2013 a Republican House and a Republican Senate.\u201d The administration\u2019s mandates apply to businesses that have 100 employees or more, certain health care workers and federal contractors. The rule issued by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration governing large employers would allow workers to submit to weekly testing instead of getting the vaccine. But a second rule that will affect about 17 million workers at health care facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding will require employees to be vaccinated with no test-out option. The two rules, slated to go into effect January 4, cover about 100 million Americans. In interviews with a half-dozen strategists on both sides of the aisle this week, most said they believed the GOP revolt against the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine requirements would largely be an issue that animates the GOP base, particularly during the primaries early next year, unless the country was to see a major exodus of health care workers from their jobs early next year. But Republicans are already weaponizing the issue against a number of Democratic governors facing competitive races next year. Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat who won her office in a Republican-dominated state by courting GOP support in 2018, recently sought to create distance from the Biden administration\u2019s vaccine rules in a statement where she said she appreciated the administration\u2019s \u201cintention to keep people safe,\u201d but said she does not believe the directive \u201cis the correct, or most effective, solution for Kansas.\u201d \u201cStates have been leading the fight against COVID-19 from the start of the pandemic,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cIt is too late to impose a federal standard now that we have already developed systems and strategies that are tailored for our specific needs.\u201d Kansas\u2019 Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican who is challenging Kelly and described her words as \u201chalf-hearted\u201d and \u201cempty,\u201d has filed three lawsuits seeking to stop the Biden administration\u2019s mandates. After filing the third this week, he tweeted that the vaccine rule applying to most health care workers will threaten \u201cthe continued operations of numerous rural hospitals and nursing homes in Kansas that already struggle to find enough staff to operate.\u201d Jesse Hunt, communications director for the Republican Governors Association, said his party will keep the pressure on not only Kelly in Kansas, but also vulnerable Democratic governors in Maine, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Nevada \u2013 forcing them to answer for \u201cwhat\u2019s best for the local economy and for states\u2019 rights.\u201d \u201cWhat we saw in Virginia and in New Jersey was that people\u2019s concerns about affordability and the workforce returning to where it was pre-pandemic, and anything that contributes to these employers\u2019 ability to earn a living, is going to backfire on these Democratic governors,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cRight now, economic concerns reign supreme in voters\u2019 minds.\u201d 'People have freedoms': Republicans eyeing 2024 take on Biden's vaccine mandate But Democratic strategist Bill Burton argued that Republicans are picking a losing side at a time when most Americans are looking for solutions that will end the pandemic and allow them to return to their normal lives. \u201cVoters aren\u2019t going to judge candidates based on the vaccine mandates; they are going to judge based on whether Covid is getting better,\u201d said Burton, the former deputy press secretary for President Barack Obama. \u201cRepublicans seem at peace with using the health of their supporters as collateral damage for their political gain, but they are wrong on the politics and they are dangerously cynical on the health impacts.\u201d Ian Russell, a Democratic consultant, cautioned that the GOP risks overreaching in their efforts to block the administration\u2019s mandates. That messaging could, for example, unnerve suburban parents who \u201cwant to support politicians who will work toward a solution to the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cThe anti-science, knuckle-dragging \u2013 if not anti-vax, certainly vaccine-skeptic \u2013 wing of the Republican Party that\u2019s on the rise these days, that\u2019s not how you win a general election,\u201d Russell said. \u201cBiden needs Covid to be in the rearview mirror by the height of the election season next year in the midterms, so we\u2019ve got to do everything we can \u2013 within the bounds of reason \u2013 to lower Covid cases so that we can fully reopen the economy, fully reopen schools and just be done with this. A vaccine mandate is a tool that he has to accomplish that goal of getting Covid in a rearview mirror.\u201d While Republicans feel they have a strong hand with their economic warnings about federal vaccine mandates, the Biden administration is facing myriad legal challenges to the two sets of rules that had been slated to go into effect on January 4. Republican leaders from more than two dozen states are suing the administration over the OSHA rule for large employers. Last Saturday, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked that rule from going into effect. On Wednesday, 10 states filed a lawsuit challenging the separate Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services rule requiring some 17 million health care workers to get fully vaccinated by the January deadline if they work at health facilities that receive Medicare or Medicaid funding. The states argued that the rule threatens to \u201cexacerbate an alarming shortage of health care workers, particularly in rural communities, that has already reached a boiling point.\u201d Those arguments are being echoed by GOP lawmakers around the country as they turn to legislation as a cudgel to resist mandates that President Joe Biden says are crucial to ending a pandemic that has claimed more than 750,000 American lives. One GOP White House aspirant, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, is looking to make headlines next week, when he has asked state lawmakers to create protections for workers from the mandates in a special legislative session. He argues that Americans are sick of \u201cbeing bossed around, restricted and mandated\u201d and he warned during a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition conference that \u201cif they can violate your freedoms on this issue, they are going to violate your freedoms on other issues.\u201d The approaching federal deadline has also inspired a raft of legislation from Republican lawmakers in statehouses across the country, including on the question of how broadly a religious exemption to getting the vaccine may be defined. In Kansas, for example, Republican lawmakers are pushing for a special session to consider legislation aimed at skirting the Biden administration\u2019s rules. One of the bills crafted by Republican Senate President Ty Masterson would bar employers from questioning the sincerity of the religious beliefs of an employee seeking an exemption; another would make sure that employees fired for refusing to get a Covid-19 vaccine are entitled to unemployment benefits. At least 14 states already have varying prohibitions on vaccine mandates, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, while 21 states and the District of Columbia currently have some form of a Covid-19 vaccine mandate in place. The Biden administration is urging large employers to press ahead with their plans to comply with the new rules by January, confident that they will withstand court challenges. (It is not yet clear which federal appeals court circuit will handle the cases. Because numerous petitioners are challenging the same rule in multiple circuits, the cases will ultimately end up in one circuit determined randomly through a lottery.) In a statement earlier this month announcing the January deadline to comply, Biden stressed that he would have preferred to avoid vaccine requirements, but said \u201ctoo many people remain unvaccinated for us to get out of this pandemic for good.\u201d He also emphasized that as large and small businesses, as well as state and local agencies, have put their own mandates in place in recent months, \u201cthere have been no \u2018mass firings\u2019 and worker shortages because of vaccination requirements.\u201d Cruz told reporters last weekend at the Republican Jewish Coalition conference that he was \u201chearing from doctors and nurses who are being fired by the thousands,\u201d as well as firefighters and police officers who are losing their jobs or in professional limbo because of what he described as \u201cillegal vaccine mandates.\u201d He said he has also been talking to pilots and air traffic controllers who say vaccine requirements have led to flight cancellations, although there have been many other factors at play in the recent flight disruptions, including understaffing woes. One challenge for Democrats in rebutting such claims is that there is no central repository of information about how many workers have left their jobs as a result of mandates thus far \u2013 key data points that could offer clues for what lies ahead in January. Much of the data has been scattered and anecdotal as it is released by companies or individual government agencies who choose to do so. \u201cThe problem is that this is very fragmented, which is usual for the United States, but still makes getting the data hard,\u201d said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Hastings College of the Law whose recent research has focused on policy related to vaccine mandates. \u201cIt\u2019s place by place and there\u2019s not really a good collection (of data).\u201d She noted that anecdotally, the cities and entities that she\u2019s been tracking \u201chave less resignations and terminations than expected.\u201d The full effect of the vaccine requirements on the workforce is also still not clear in some of the cities with more restrictive vaccine policies, like Los Angeles and New York, where many requests for medical or religious exemptions are still under review. New York tells SCOTUS to allow vaccine mandate for health care workers to remain on the books New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat who has championed vaccine mandates as a key tool for moving the city beyond the pandemic, reported Wednesday that about 93% of the city\u2019s work force is now vaccinated and that only 2,600 employees are on leave without pay for refusing to comply with the city\u2019s vaccine mandate. That amounts, he said, to less than 1% of all employees \u2013 a major decline from about 9,000 employees who went on leave without pay when the policy took effect. The mayor said there are about 12,400 accommodation requests pending for those who requested medical or religious exemptions. \u201cSome of those will be approved, a good number will not be. Then people will have the choice, of course: get vaccinated, come back to work, and I do expect most people are going to take that choice based on everything we\u2019re seeing here,\u201d de Blasio said Wednesday. \u201cMost people will ultimately make the decision to get vaccinated, and we welcome that.\u201d While majorities of Americans were supportive of vaccine mandates for teachers, health care workers and certain government workers in polling throughout the summer and early fall, Liz Hamel, the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s director of public opinion and survey research, said questions about employer mandates have tended to cleave more narrowly along party lines. About half of workers said a in mid-October KFF survey that they do not want their employer to require the Covid-19 vaccine and about a quarter said their employer already does. More than a third of unvaccinated workers said they would leave their job if their employer required vaccination or weekly testing, and seven in ten unvaccinated workers said they would quit if they were not given a testing option \u2013 though Hamel cautioned that is likely an \u201coverestimate\u201d since many employees likely would not follow through when they face the loss of their livelihoods and incomes. Overall, only 5% of unvaccinated adults said they had left a job because they were required to get vaccinated, which accounted to 1% of all adults nationwide. When the October respondents were asked whether they supported a federal mandate requiring large employers to make sure their workers get vaccinated \u2013 with an option for weekly testing as an alternative \u2013 57% were supportive and 40% were opposed. \u201cWe don\u2019t find any type of mandate that is supported by even close to half of Republicans,\u201d Hamel said. \u201cThat all suggests that the messaging of not wanting vaccines to be required is likely to be really effective with a Republican audience.\u201d Whether it extends beyond that, though, remains to be seen.",

CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper uncovers the planning and motivations behind the January 6 insurrection in a new documentary airing Friday at 9 p.m. ET. He interviews numerous Republicans who were in the White House, in Congress and out in the states, watching in frustration and horror as then-President Donald Trump tried to mount his coup. What I found most interesting, and disturbing, were their warnings that Trump could be learning from his mistakes and setting the stage to repeat his efforts to steal the election in 2024. \u201cIt looks to me that he has evaluated what went wrong on January 6. Why is it that he wasn\u2019t able to steal the election \u2013 who stood in his way?\u201d Republican Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio told Tapper. \u201cAnd he\u2019s going methodically, state by state, at races from, you know, state Senate races all the way down to county commissioner races trying to get the people who the Republicans \u2013 the RINOs, in his words \u2013 who stopped this, who stopped him from stealing the election,\u201d he said. RELATED: January 6 committee acts on multiple fronts in a race against time Gonzalez, whose parents fled oppression in Cuba, was among the House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. He\u2019s also decided to leave Congress at the end of his term. The Republicans who supported impeachment and are not retiring all face primary challenges from pro-Trump Republicans. Tapper asked Wyoming\u2019s Rep. Liz Cheney if it will be worth it to lose her job over this. Cheney is one of two Republicans serving on the House committee investigating the insurrection; the other is Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, who recently announced he is not running for reelection. \u201cTo me, there\u2019s not even really a choice or a calculation. It\u2019s just what is the right thing here and what has to be done,\u201d she said. She made clear that she intends to run and win again. Alyssa Farah is Trump\u2019s former communications director. She watched the insurrection unfold from the White House. She told Tapper that what frightens her is the focus by Trump supporters on taking over state-level roles \u2013 the people who run elections. \u201cI think that there is a concerted effort to try to recruit loyalists to put into those chambers,\u201d she said. Specifically, Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who found the courage to refuse to \u201cfind votes\u201d as Trump requested, faces a challenge from pro-Trump Rep. Jody Hice. In Arizona, another pro-Trump Republican, state Rep. Mark Finchem, is seeking the secretary of state position. \u201cHe\u2019s already received the endorsement of Donald Trump. He has said over and over again that this was a fraudulent election. He\u2019s called for decertification. He\u2019s got a decent chance to win this primary,\u201d Bill Gates, a Republican on the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, told Tapper. \u201cIf we had people like that in these key positions moving forward, I think we are in danger.\u201d RELATED: Secretaries of state targeted by Trump election lies live in fear for their safety and are desperate for protection Georgia\u2019s Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan is not seeking reelection because he doesn\u2019t want to appease Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to do and say the things I have to do and say right now to win a primary with Donald Trump trying to play the games he\u2019s playing,\u201d Duncan said. We continue to learn more about the insurrection, but questions remain. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen has a detailed timeline of how Trump tried to weaponize the Justice Department to overthrow the 2020 election. You\u2019ve read that a lot \u2013 that Trump tried to overthrow the election \u2013 but this in-depth piece looks at the specific and methodical steps he took. Here are some excerpts from Cohen\u2019s timeline: January 3 \u2013 (Acting Attorney General Jeff) Rosen and (acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Jeffrey) Clark go to the Oval Office for an \u201cApprentice\u201d-style showdown, according to testimony from top officials. Trump considers firing Rosen and installing Clark as acting attorney general, because Clark is willing to send the letters to Georgia and other battleground states telling them there were \u201cirregularities\u201d with their elections. Trump opens the three-hour meeting by saying, \u201cOne thing we know is you, Rosen, aren\u2019t going to do anything to overturn the election.\u201d CNN previously reported that about a half-dozen senior department officials are prepared to resign in protest if Rosen is deposed, but Rosen survives the meeting. Later that night, after the meeting, Trump calls (Rosen\u2019s deputy, Richard) Donoghue to tell him about new fraud claims. January 4 \u2013 The US attorney in Atlanta, Byung Jin \u201cBJay\u201d Pak, abruptly resigns, citing \u201cunforeseen circumstances.\u201d According to Pak\u2019s testimony to the Senate, Donoghue told him he needed to quit because Trump was going to fire him. Trump said during the Oval Office showdown a day earlier that he believed Pak was a \u201cnever Trumper\u201d and that Pak wasn\u2019t doing enough to find fraud. Trump then changes the line of succession to replace Pak with a US attorney who he believes will \u201cdo something\u201d about the election, according to the Senate report. Separately, Trump meets with Pence in the Oval Office. Also in attendance is right-wing lawyer John Eastman, who pitches Pence on a legally dubious scheme to declare Trump the winner while Pence presides over the counting of the electoral votes, according to a bombshell book from Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa. (Eastman later told CNN that he sought only to delay certification, not to throw the election to Trump.) January 6 \u2013 Tens of thousands of Trump supporters descend on Washington for a rally. Trump delivers a militant speech and urges his followers to march to the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell\u201d to stop lawmakers, and Pence, from certifying the election results. Thousands of rioters attack the Capitol, breaching the Senate floor. The House and Senate investigations are on a timeline themselves. Legal efforts to compel testimony from additional Trump aides would take time, but if the elections in Virginia and New Jersey are any indication, Democrats may control Congress only until January 2023.",

Republicans want to move on from the January 6 insurrection, arguing it\u2019s time to focus on the future. But their amnesia has grown along with their fealty to former President Donald Trump, and it is again thrusting the US form of democracy into peril. The growing fear outside the committed base of the GOP is that the attempted coup of 2021 was not a one-off, but rather \u201ca dress rehearsal for something that could be happening near term, in 2022, and 2024.\u201d Those are the words of Fiona Hill \u2013 the Brookings Institution senior fellow, former Russia expert on the National Security Council and witness at the first Trump impeachment hearing \u2013 who said on CBS News on Sunday that the US is in a dangerous place. She said it\u2019s absolutely appropriate to view the Capitol insurrection as a sort of pre-revolutionary act. RELATED: US Capitol Police whistleblower alleges leadership failures on January 6 The coming question for all Americans is whether their government should be run by a president and a government selected by voters. This past weekend provided multiple examples of how the GOP is moving to fully embrace Trump and his overtly antidemocratic views. Steve Scalise, the second-ranking House Republican, was pushed repeatedly Sunday by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace about whether the 2020 election was legitimate. He would not say \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been very clear from the beginning,\u201d Scalise said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cIf you look at a number of states, they didn\u2019t follow their state-passed laws that govern the election for president. That is what the United States Constitution says. They don\u2019t say the states determine what the rules are. They say the state legislatures determine the rules.\u201d 'Disgusting, pathetic': Avlon reacts to Scalise moment from Fox News interview This antiquated view of constitutional law is the bedrock of a growing view that, apparently, legislatures and not voters, should select presidents. It\u2019s a misreading of state laws and antidemocratic to the core. It\u2019s becoming the main view of Trump-backing Republicans. As Scalise moved toward the election doubter crowd, fellow Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming tweeted in direct response to his comments that there should be room for truth in the GOP. She said: \u201cMillions of Americans have been sold a fraud that the election was stolen. Republicans have a duty to tell the American people that this is not true. Perpetuating the Big Lie is an attack on the core of our constitutional republic.\u201d What she said is correct. What makes it most notable is how lonely she sounds saying it. That Sen. Chuck Grassley feels the need to seek Trump\u2019s approval is telling. Grassley is  the longest-serving Republican in the Senate who has been in office for many decades. He appeared alongside Trump at a rally in his home state of Iowa over the weekend. \u201cI was born at night, but not last night. So if I didn\u2019t accept the endorsement of a person who\u2019s got 91% of the Republican voters in Iowa, I wouldn\u2019t be too smart. I\u2019m smart enough to accept that endorsement,\u201d Grassley said. Top Republican's response to Trump's move stuns Jake Tapper It\u2019s an odd turn for a lawmaker who spent decades building up a reputation as a strong-willed pragmatist and protector of whistleblowers. Don\u2019t expect Trump to join Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell on the campaign trail. McConnell may be the highest-ranking Republican in elected office, and he might have drastically softened his tone when addressing the insurrection, but he still provides an excellent target for Trump\u2019s political attacks. Last week, McConnell acquiesced to Democrats\u2019 demands and offered a two-month reprieve in a standoff over the US debt ceiling that, if not raised, could send the US economy over a cliff. Trump\u2019s words for McConnell speak to the fact that he sees no problem with sabotaging the economy. \u201cAnd you know what it does? It gives the Democrats more time, two months, gives them more time to figure it out,\u201d Trump said in Iowa. \u201cThey can now have two more months to figure it out how to screw us, OK.\u201d He\u2019ll never forgive McConnell for not working to overturn the 2020 election. RELATED: Trump tears into McConnell over debt ceiling deal with Democrats \u201cMitch McConnell should have challenged that election, because even back then we had plenty of material to challenge that election. He should have challenged the election,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s only a leader because he raises a lot of money and he gives it to senators, that\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s got. That\u2019s his only form of leadership.\u201d Trump may also be seeking Grassley\u2019s embrace. This has a normalizing effect on Trump and his efforts to overturn the election, perhaps, for those people who don\u2019t follow politics every day and have been voting for Grassley their whole lives. All signs point to Trump running again for president in 2024. He was in Iowa over the weekend. It\u2019s usually the first state to make a choice in presidential primaries. CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter wrote about the online attention paid to an eight-minute monologue by the comedian Bill Maher, which tackled the danger of Trump\u2019s \u201cslow-moving coup\u201d spread over several elections instead of ending in 2021. Democrats will continue to raise the idea that Trump is leading the US in an antidemocratic direction. During an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View,\u201d former US Secretary of State and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton said the United States is \u201cin the midst of a concerted, well-funded effort to undermine American democracy.\u201d \u201cI think we not only came close to a full constitutional crisis, I think we\u2019re still in it,\u201d Clinton said Monday. \u201cThat gives me absolutely no satisfaction in saying this, because I think we\u2019re at a very dangerous, continuing high-level attack on the legitimacy of our government and the election of our president. And obviously, our former president is not only behind it, he incited it, he encouraged it and he continues to do so.\u201d Neither Christine Todd Whitman nor Miles Taylor are, or have been, close to the GOP\u2019s base for some time. She\u2019s the former New Jersey governor and Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and he is the former Trump-era Department of Homeland Security official who wrote under the pseudonym \u201cAnonymous\u201d about defying his former boss. RELATED: GOP senators who voted to convict Trump say it\u2019s too soon to worry that he could undermine 2024 election But they\u2019ve raised the alarm about their party\u2019s direction and pledge in the New York Times Opinion section to support endangered moderate Democrats like Rep. Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Sen. Mark Kelly in Arizona. They\u2019re also interested in saving truth-telling Republicans like Cheney. \u201cIt\u2019s become obvious that political extremists maintain a viselike grip on the national G.O.P., the state parties and the process for fielding and championing House and Senate candidates in next year\u2019s elections,\u201d they wrote, adding that they and others have considered forming a party to appeal to disaffected Republicans. \u201cRational Republicans are losing the G.O.P. civil war. And the only near-term way to battle pro-Trump extremists is for all of us to team up on key races and overarching political goals with our longtime political opponents: the Democratic Party,\u201d they wrote. All indications are the party is moving in the opposite direction and casting moderates aside even as it looks toward gains in 2022. Despite all of this, Republicans have the historical advantage and the momentum heading into the 2022 midterm election. As Trump consolidates his hold over the party, its expected success next year could create a feedback loop among Republicans to double down on their support for him. RELATED: The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 The vast majority of Americans have no interest in violent confrontation, so there was something jarring in the words of a supporter at Trump\u2019s Iowa rally who said very seriously that \u201ccivil war is coming.\u201d That kind of active mindset is exactly what was behind the insurrection. It\u2019s clearly still around \u2013 and it was blooming at Trump\u2019s rally.",

            "article_content": "Back in 2013, Terry McAuliffe won a majority of Black voters when he sought \u2013 and ultimately won \u2013 the top office in Virginia. As he vies for a second term as the Commonwealth\u2019s governor, he wants to do it again. With less than a month to go in the election, McAuliffe and Republican nominee Glenn Youngkin are locked in a competitive race in a state Joe Biden carried by 10 points last year. The outcome of this year\u2019s contest will be closely watched inside and outside the Commonwealth for clues about the mood of the electorate heading into the 2022 midterm elections. According to a recent Monmouth University poll, McAuliffe has an advantage among voters of color \u2013 83% of Black voters support him, compared to the 3% who are backing Youngkin. And a Fox News poll shows McAuliffe is the preferred candidate among Black voters by 69 points. (Black Virginians make up roughly 20 percent of the state\u2019s population.) It\u2019s an advantage he\u2019s seen before. In 2013, the Virginia Democrat won 90% of their votes, compared to the 8% won by Republican Ken Cuccinelli. His campaign\u2019s outreach efforts this year include targeted communications to Black voters, visiting Black churches across the state, organizing Sunday \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d events and working with field organizers at Virginia\u2019s major colleges including Historically Black Colleges and Universities like Hampton University and Norfolk State University among a host of other initiatives. When asked by CNN about his commitment to addressing the concerns of Black voters following the second and final debate against Youngkin last month, McAuliffe said, \u201cI have tremendous support from the Black community.\u201d He cited his 2015 executive order \u201cbanning the box,\u201d which largely prohibited asking about criminal history on state employment applications. He also mentioned his move to ban the Confederate flag from state license plates and his push to lay the groundwork for Medicaid expansion. Additionally, his campaign, seemingly attune to criticism that Black voters are taken for granted by Democrats, has published a comprehensive plan to \u201cLift Up Black Virginians.\u201d It includes viewing racism as a public health crisis, making the restoration of voting rights permanent in Virginia\u2019s constitution and transforming Virginia\u2019s regulatory process to increase support for minority-owned businesses among other provisions. McAuliffe himself often points to a voting provision he dismantled the last time he was the chief executive of the Old Dominion, ultimately restoring voting rights for more than 173,000 formerly incarcerated Virginians. That act granted Richmond activist Christopher Rashad Green the right to vote for the first time in 30 years in 2016. \u201cWhen I voted in 2016, it was just so empowering,\u201d Green said. \u201c\u2026 My vote is political currency. And that\u2019s my currency. I could spend it however I want to.\u201d He used that currency this year to vote early for McAuliffe. Louise Lucas, the Virginia Senate\u2019s president pro tempore, was among McAuliffe\u2019s early supporters. She serves as co-campaign chair and asked him to run for governor again. \u201cTerry has been absolutely wonderful for the Commonwealth for all people. I\u2019m telling you, he has made a gallant effort to make sure that we get out the vote in the Black community\u2026I mean, I don\u2019t know what more anybody can expect this man to do,\u201d said Lucas. \u201cHe has worked his heart out.\u201d Still, Youngkin is not without his supporters. On Saturday, the Republican nominee received the endorsement of the business-focused Hampton Roads Black Caucus, a group that works to increase the representation of elected officials who advocate for legislation aimed at enhancing the Black community. \u201cThe Black Virginians for Glenn Coalition was one of the first coalitions the campaign launched. It plays a critical role in reaching out to Black voters and demonstrating that Glenn\u2019s plans to remove regulations so businesses can thrive, provide parents with school choice, and boosting our economy \u2013 will best serve them,\u201d Youngkin campaign spokesperson Macaulay Porter said. While the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus did not endorse any candidate ahead of the Democratic primary earlier this year, all 23 members of the Black Caucus now support McAuliffe, according to the group\u2019s executive director, Adele McClure. But it wasn\u2019t always that way. In the primary, he ran against one current and one former member of the caucus: Virginia state Senator Jennifer McClellan and former Virginia state delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy. McClellan had previously suggested McAuliffe could not excite and expand the base. But in an interview with CNN, she noted that \u201cvoters chose him.\u201d She now chairs Women for Terry. \u201cI am supporting him, because I think he is more in line with taking Virginia in the direction that we need to go,\u201d said McClellan. \u201cHe really pushed to improve and expand and grow Virginia\u2019s economy, diversify our economy. That included focusing on small women and minority, Black-owned businesses. He really pushed to have a diverse cabinet\u2026historic investments in our public education system,\u201d McClellan said of his first-term track record. Earlier this year, Carroll Foy described McAuliffe as \u201cfailing the people of Virginia.\u201d She is now actively campaigning for McAuliffe, because \u201cnow he\u2019s the Democratic nominee.\u201d She views McAuliffe as Democrats\u2019 best hope for expanding on the progress the party has made in the state legislature in recent years. \u201cI want to see legislation that I started like ending pregnancy discrimination, passing the Equal Rights Amendment, I want those things that I\u2019ve started to continue to move forward,\u201d she said. Still, the Petersburg native detailed this election\u2019s unprecedented challenges. \u201cWhen I am knocking doors\u2026what I\u2019m hearing is a lot of apathy. And people are telling me how they\u2019re still looking for work and a job, how they\u2019re sitting at their dining room table with an open chair, because they\u2019ve lost a loved one recently due to Covid. And it\u2019s hard to focus on an election when you\u2019re about to get evicted,\u201d she said. Richmond-based organizer Chelsea Higgs Wise is not impressed with the McAuliffe campaign\u2019s Black outreach, dismissing the effort as talking points that won\u2019t amount to substantive policy changes unless grassroots activists like her keep the pressure on McAuliffe, should he be elected. \u201cI do not think that the Terry McAuliffe campaign is doing the type of outreach that will make a real difference and reaching Black voters, particularly after 2020 with Covid and the uprisings,\u201d said Higgs Wise, in reference to the historic call for police reform following the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Higgs Wise, the executive director of Marijuana Justice, voiced several issues with the campaign, including \u201crunning on things that Black women started,\u201d and is especially frustrated with McAuliffe\u2019s reversal on ending qualified immunity, a legal principle that shields police officers from civil lawsuits. McAuliffe said he supported ending qualified immunity during the Democratic primary, but reversed his position after becoming the nominee. \u201cTerry McAuliffe is very loud about funding police. That means moving money from where we need for social services, mental health, food, transportation, and he will move that more to law enforcement,\u201d she said. The Virginia State Conference NAACP, a nonpartisan organization, has not endorsed any candidate in the gubernatorial race, but the group\u2019s president, Robert N. Barnette Jr., described McAuliffe\u2019s wavering on ending qualified immunity as \u201cconcerning.\u201d The organization\u2019s top priority is police reform and they\u2019ve been active in voter education, informing Virginians of who the candidates running for elected office in Virginia are and their platforms. \u201cI think Terry knows that qualified immunity, really is hampering transparency in our Black and brown communities,\u201d Barnette Jr. said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s governor, we\u2019re going to still ask the governor to ask the attorney general to investigate law-enforcement involved shootings,\u201d he added. Princess Blanding, who is mounting a third-party run in the Virginia race for governor, is harshly critical of McAuliffe and Black Democratic leaders across the state. She suggests Black Virginians with dissenting views like hers are afraid to come forward. Her brother, Marcus-David Peters, was shot and killed by police when he was experiencing a mental health episode in 2018. \u201cThey just expect that they will automatically get the Black vote. They have to earn it. And they have not earned it,\u201d Blanding said of the McAuliffe campaign. When CNN noted there was significant overlap between the policy positions championed by Blanding and McAuliffe, Blanding said, \u201cAnybody can put anything up on their website\u2026but are you going to follow through?\u201d Alexsis Rodgers, a former Richmond mayoral candidate who now works as the Virginia state director for the domestic workers advocacy group Care in Action, sees the McAuliffe campaign responding to the pressure from organizers in real time. \u201cI\u2019ve been glad to see McAuliffe cite repeatedly that he is going to fight for paid sick leave, paid family and medical leave, and even make sure that home care workers get a raise. And I think that is a direct result of workers organizing\u2026who have really pushed him to adopt policies that are going to uplift Black women and working women of color,\u201d Rodgers said. Rodgers says Black voters across the state, whose voting power may determine the outcome of the election, are seeking to elevate elected officials with a strong plan to respond to the pandemic. Rodgers notes the governor has limited authority and stresses there should also be concern for the down ballot races that will determine who controls the state\u2019s General Assembly to \u201cmake sure that down ballot we have strong women of color and Black women who are going to be able to hold the administration accountable to the commitment that they\u2019ve made along the campaign trail.\u201d On Sunday evening in Manassas, a Northern Virginia city about 30 miles outside of Washington, DC, dozens of Black women gathered to show their support for McAuliffe at an event held in the backyard of the home of former Manassas Democratic Committee Chair EJ Scott. When McAuliffe walked in, he asked 98-year-old Jane Paschall if she was single, generating thunderous laughter from the crowd before going on to suggest he pair her with his young staffer. When he made his pitch for another term at what he describes as the \u201cgreatest job in America,\u201d McAuliffe promised high-paying jobs, an open and welcoming state for women and the LGBTQ community and protecting reproductive choice. Marveled by how the state\u2019s political landscape has shifted in the past few decades with Democrats holding a majority in both chambers in the state legislature and an expansion of early voting, the women say they are in part attracted to McAuliffe based on how he talks about racial injustice. \u201cNow, if you were a young White kid who killed somebody, you might get 25 or 30 years,\u201d McAuliffe said to the group, lamenting cases of Black men who received life sentences for lesser crimes like robbery and touting his own record of providing them pardons, later describing himself to CNN as a \u201ccriminal justice warrior.\u201d Franklin County School Board member Penny Blue said she first became attracted to McAuliffe\u2019s message when she heard him talk about the school-to-prison pipeline, the tendency of marginalized minors who are harshly punished in school ending up in the juvenile justice system. \u201cI was impressed that he had the nerve to say that because most people don\u2019t say it and don\u2019t talk about it,\u201d said Blue, who traveled to the event from four hours away in Southwest Virginia. When CNN asked McAuliffe if he viewed Black Virginians as consequential to his victory in November, McAuliffe said, \u201cI view Black participation, key for any race, not just governor. But any race we run here in Virginia and around the country, just absolutely critical.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Immediately after Gavin Newsom beat back a recall effort, Democratic officials in California called for reforms to the process that commanded weeks of attention and cost $276 million \u2013 only to result in a landslide victory for a governor who was up for reelection in 14 months anyway. Even before Newsom resoundingly defeated the attempted recall, reforming the process had been a focus for some Democrats in the state\u2019s capital of Sacramento. Those calls for change were renewed after Tuesday\u2019s results by people like state Assemblyman Marc Berman, who leads the legislative body\u2019s Elections Committee, and state Sen. Steve Glazer, who leads the Senate Elections and Constitutional Amendments Committee. The two plan to hold hearings in the coming months and ultimately propose constitutional changes after the legislature reconvenes early next year. \u201cThere is clearly a lot of interest in reforming this process, making it more democratic,\u201d Berman said Wednesday. Newsom said before and after the recall election this week that the process had been \u201cweaponized.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been perverted,\u201d he told a crowd of union workers in Fresno last week. \u201cIt can\u2019t wait a few months? Quite literally a few months? To go next June and go to battle?\u201d Next year\u2019s governor\u2019s race starts with a primary in June. The top two finishers \u2013 regardless of party affiliation \u2013 advance to the November general election. The recall election process was added to California\u2019s constitution 110 years ago and initially intended as a way of rooting out corruption. To result in a vote, recall attempts in California require the petition signatures of at least 12% of the voter turnout in the last election for the targeted office. Recall efforts are common in California: Since 1913, there have been 179 attempts to recall state elected officials, the California secretary of state\u2019s office said. (Of those, 55 have targeted a governor.) Only 11 have reached the ballot. And six have been successful, resulting in the removal of two state assembly members, three state senators and one governor: Democrat Gray Davis in 2003. Davis, who remains the only governor to be successfully recalled, was replaced by Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger. Proponents of the changes have put forward a series of suggestions, including increasing the number of signatures needed to initiate a recall and raising the threshold for candidates who can run as a possible replacement. California Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Kevin Mullin tweeted Tuesday night that the effort to recall Newsom was \u201ca $276 million waste just to reaffirm 2018\u2019s results with an election coming in 2022.\u201d He said the recall process should see a series of reforms, including elevating the lieutenant governor to the top job if a governor is recalled rather than having Californians vote on a second question on recall ballots on who should replace the sitting governor. Democratic state Assemblymember Kevin McCarty said on Twitter that he\u2019d co-author Mullin\u2019s proposal. State Sen. Josh Newman, a Democrat who was recalled himself in 2018 but won back his Senate seat in 2020, has proposed legislation that would reform recalls, including one bill that would allow those targeted by recall efforts to access the list of petition signers to make sure they understood what they had signed and were not misled and one bill that would ban recall organizers from paying people to circulate petitions. California Secretary of State Shirley Weber has also pushed for changes to the system, citing the high cost of running an off-year election. \u201cIf the state of California is going to spend nearly $300 million to have a special election, it better be worth having \u2013 which is to say it should be structured to promote broad participation and the decision to hold an election should reflect the true will of the people,\u201d Weber said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe recall process as currently designed, which hasn\u2019t been revised in a century, makes those goals difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to achieve.\u201d Weber said that her focus in this recall election was \u201censuring that every legal vote cast in this election is counted\u201d and that the result \u201cwill reflect the will of the people.\u201d But she noted that the structure of the current recall process makes that \u201can uphill climb\u201d and that she hopes to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d in the future. The latest recall was in some ways an attempt to hack a California election system in which Republicans otherwise have little chance of victory, by turning the choice of governor into a two-step process: First, voters would decide whether to keep or remove Newsom. Then, in a separate question, they\u2019d pick a potential replacement. And weeks before Election Night, it looked like that approach might work, with polls showing Newsom in serious jeopardy of being recalled. The strategy faltered as it became clear the only viable candidate to replace Newsom was Larry Elder, a right-wing talk radio host with a history of incendiary comments and socially conservative positions that were a mismatch for the electorate of the sapphire-blue state. His emergence turned what had started as an up-or-down vote on Newsom into a two-candidate race that more closely resembled a typical election cycle. That evolution in Newsom\u2019s favor came in large part because of Newsom\u2019s team\u2019s decision to discourage any other big-name Democrats from entering the race \u2013 leaving Democratic voters with no backup plan if Newsom was recalled. Orrin Heatlie, the retired Yolo County sheriff\u2019s sergeant whose group, the California Patriot Coalition, organized the recall, told Fox 40 in Sacramento on Wednesday that the state\u2019s recall laws should not be reformed. \u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult process as it is,\u201d Heatlie said, noting that his petition drive was the only one of several efforts to recall Newsom to go forward. \u201cIf they were that easily done, then it would be something that people did all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cVery few of them get as far as this one did, for good reason. It\u2019s a very difficult process as it stands.\u201d Heatlie compared his group to the \u201cBad News Bears,\u201d saying recall proponents were \u201cthe underdog all the way.\u201d He argued that the effort was worthwhile despite its failure to remove Newsom from office. \u201cI think it did affect a change, because the government officials here in Sacramento know that the people are paying attention to what they\u2019re doing and we\u2019ve raised concern,\u201d Heatlie said. \u201cWe generated a conversation that\u2019s needed to take place in California for a very long time. And I think as we move forward, this momentum, this movement, is going to continue to grow and go.\u201d",

            "article_content": "California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered a decisive answer to the question of whether voters would penalize those who enacted strict policies aimed at slowing the coronavirus pandemic, triumphing over an effort to recall him Tuesday. Newsom faced the first recall election in California in 18 years. At one point, weeks before the election, he appeared to be in serious enough jeopardy that Democrats decided to dispatch President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to campaign for him. Republicans sought a replay of 2003, when actor Arnold Schwarzenegger attracted support across ideological lines and voters decided to boot then-Gov. Gray Davis. This time, though, the party\u2019s leading candidate, talk radio host Larry Elder, stuck much closer to conservative orthodoxy \u2013 making it difficult to attract the sort of broad bipartisan support that it takes for a GOP candidate to win in deep-blue California. And his long history of incendiary comments \u2013 combined with the odd recall system that virtually guaranteed Elder would become governor if Newsom was recalled \u2013 energized those who had largely tuned the election out and might not have cast their ballots. Here are five takeaways from California\u2019s recall election: Gavin Newsom holds onto his job as California governor, CNN projects Newsom\u2019s aggressive actions to slow the spread of the coronavirus \u2013 the same restrictions that helped spur the recall election \u2013 got a significant boost on Tuesday night, proving to Democrats across the country that strict pandemic policy can be good politics. Newsom nodded to this in his election night remarks to reporters, stating that while people voted \u201cno,\u201d that vote meant they said, \u201cyes to science, yes to vaccines \u2026 yes to ending this pandemic.\u201d This, more than any lesson coming out of California, is the most likely to permeate other elections later this year and in 2022 \u2013 helping back up Democrats who have pushed strict coronavirus measures to curb the ongoing spread of the Delta variant in the face of a small but vocal opposition. Newsom staked his campaign on his stringent Covid measures, using them to attack Elder as lax on the pandemic, contrasting himself with Republican governors in Texas and Florida and running fully alongside the new vaccine requirements that Biden announced just days before Election Day. \u201cWe saw the Delta surge as a real inflection moment in this campaign,\u201d said Sean Clegg, Newsom\u2019s top strategist. \u201cWhat Delta brought into clear, clear focus was what the stakes are in this election when one party has basically become an anti-science, anti-vaccine, anti-public health party.\u201d California Democrats voted along broader political lines to save Newsom, CNN exit poll shows In the same breath that he acknowledged Newsom\u2019s defeat of the recall on stage Tuesday night, Elder hinted at another run next year, in California\u2019s normally scheduled governor\u2019s race. \u201cWe may have lost the battle, but we are going to win the war,\u201d Elder said. That might be a headache for California Republicans. The party had other options \u2013 including former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer \u2013 who could have been less objectionable to moderate and Democratic voters. But conservatives in the state rallied around Elder, the talk radio host with a long record of incendiary comments that Newsom seized on. His campaign framed the race as a choice between two candidates, one of whom was far out of step with California\u2019s overwhelming Democratic majority, rather than a simple up-or-down referendum on the governor. Still, Elder, who if elected would be California\u2019s first Black governor, has galvanized conservatives in a state where Republicans are all but powerless. He could be a prominent voice in the GOP in the coming midterm elections. \u201cAs a former radio host, let me just say this: Stay tuned,\u201d Elder said Tuesday night. Many of the lessons Democrats across the country can take away from the defeat of the recall are far less definitive \u2013 complicated both by the fact that that state, with its nearly 2-1 registration advantage for Democrats, looks little like most key races in 2022 and that recall elections, by nature, create unique electoral conditions. Newsom\u2019s advisers were quick to argue that national Democrats would be wise to follow their lead \u2013 urging them to tie their opponents to Trump, like the governor did, and to nationalize races to ratchet up the stakes. \u201cLarry Elder is on the ballot here on the recall, but a version of Larry Elder is going to be on the ballot all over the country,\u201d said Juan Rodriguez, Newsom\u2019s campaign manager. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an important lesson for Democrats and how they kind of lean into the message that we have done.\u201d Democrats tasked with winning key races in 2021 and 2022 were less certain that California provided them with a roadmap, given the state\u2019s unique political make up. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to see any real inferences that could be made from the California results,\u201d said a top Democrat in Virginia, where Terry McAuliffe is currently running for a second term as governor, \u201chold for some of the broader messaging points as it pertains to Covid response and the Republican brand.\u201d The California recall may backfire on its supporters California had looked poised to become the latest addition to former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie,\u201d with Republicans showing signs of denying the reality of the outcome of the recall election. Elder had warned of \u201cshenanigans\u201d in the voting process. His campaign had launched a website for those who experienced problems voting or saw evidence of fraud to submit affidavits. And on stage Tuesday night, before Elder spoke, speakers cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election process. \u201cSome TV stations are saying that it\u2019s coming to an end \u2013 it\u2019s way too early. It\u2019s way too early. They\u2019ve just counted the mail ballots. They\u2019ve still got to count the real ballots; the working people who go to the polls on a daily basis,\u201d Republican former Lt. Gov. Abel Maldonado said. Instead, it appears the chatter about election fraud was simply a way of energizing conservative voters who have bought into Trump\u2019s lies. Elder appeared to put an end to that talk on stage. He made no mention of election fraud. And he interrupted supporters who were booing Newsom. \u201cLet\u2019s be gracious in defeat,\u201d he said. The price tag for California\u2019s recall election was $276 million, according to the state\u2019s Department of Finance. Ultimately, the state\u2019s odd laws allowed for an election that wasn\u2019t close to be held, at enormous expense, just 14 months before Newsom would have been on the ballot for reelection anyway. Along the way, it prompted calls to reform the recall process \u2013 which can be triggered through a petition signed by 12% of the voter turnout of the state\u2019s last gubernatorial election, for any reason. \u201cA $276 million waste just to reaffirm 2018\u2019s results with an election coming in 2022,\u201d California Assembly Speaker Pro Temp Kevin Mullin tweeted Tuesday night. Mullin said reforms should include elevating the lieutenant governor to the state\u2019s chief executive position if a governor is successfully recalled, rather than having voters choose a replacement on the same ballot. Newsom\u2019s campaign urged voters to vote \u201cno\u201d on whether to recall him, and then leave the second question \u2013 who should replace him if he was to be recalled \u2013 blank. That strategy appeared problematic when polls showed a close race with no viable Democratic candidate if Newsom was recalled. But it ultimately helped Newsom\u2019s campaign turn the contest into a head-to-head with Elder.",

            "article_content": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his allies have spent the past few weeks ahead of Tuesday\u2019s recall making one direct pitch to Democratic voters \u2013 \u201cVote no and go\u201d \u2013 asking them to vote \u201cno\u201d on ousting Newsom and send their ballots back without bothering to answer the second question about whom they would like to replace him. For Newsom, an embattled Democratic governor who\u2019s taken heat for his pandemic restrictions as well as the state\u2019s drought and wildfire crises, the strategy is about turnout. Running in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans nearly 2-to-1, Newsom\u2019s ability to keep his job rests on getting those Democratic voters to return their ballots. Republicans have a clear math problem in the state, but they\u2019ve got enthusiasm on their side in this election, which means the pro-Newsom camp cannot afford for Democratic voters to be apathetic \u2013 or even slightly confused about the Golden State\u2019s recall process and its two-sided ballot. Voters will be asked two questions. One, do they want to recall Newsom; and two, whom do they want to replace him? The thinking is that if voters feel confused about the list of more than 40 names of potential Newsom replacements who are largely unknown, they might hold on to their ballots longer or skip voting altogether because they don\u2019t have time to do the \u201cresearch\u201d or make an informed decision. Union workers propel Newsom in waning days of recall campaign So far, Newsom\u2019s gambit seems to be paying off with reams of Democratic voters returning their ballots early. But it has infuriated some of the Democratic replacement candidates like financial analyst and real estate investor Kevin Paffrath, who argue it is undemocratic to convince voters that they don\u2019t have other choices on the ballot. Paffrath and other Newsom critics believe that the advice to skip question two is self-serving \u2013 protecting Newsom from the embarrassment of having to face a real Democratic challenger in the recall contest or when he runs for governor again in 2022. \u201cIt\u2019s either stupid or sabotage,\u201d said Paffrath, who has 1.7 million followers on his YouTube channel. He notes that the Newsom team\u2019s effort to get Democratic voters to ignore other candidates has made it hard for him to engage their interest on his ideas to address the housing crisis, homelessness and the cost of living. \u201cI think it\u2019s stupid, because Californians should vote on a backup. If Gov. Newsom loses the recall and Californians didn\u2019t consolidate around a backup Democrat, then you just guaranteed a win for a Republican,\u201d Paffrath said. He reasoned that if Democrats had consolidated around a backup candidate within their own party, they would \u201cvery likely be able to beat any of the Republicans running right now.\u201d While there are nine Democrats running, none of them are well-known candidates, which has caused some consternation among Democrats who are not close to Newsom about the lack of a fallback option. The fear is that Californians could vote to recall Newsom, perhaps angered by his pandemic response and the state\u2019s wildfire, housing and homelessness crises, but that there\u2019d be no strong Democratic alternative to replace him with. Under state law, a majority would have to vote remove Newsom, but if he is removed, the replacement candidate receiving the highest number of votes will be elected for the remainder of the governor\u2019s term, which ends January 2023. That means that a new governor could be elected with a simple plurality. That was especially a concern this summer when conservative talk show host Larry Elder, a Republican, shot to the top of the pack in polling of the replacement candidates. The fear of a Republican winning has subsided some as Democrats have watched Newsom successfully weaponize the ideological contrast between himself and Elder, casting the leading GOP candidate as a Trump acolyte and trying to make the race about national issues that will energize the Democratic base. Democratic consultant Michael Trujillo said Newsom and the Democratic Party ultimately made \u201can informed gamble\u201d by telling their voters not to fill out question two. \u201cWhat Team Newsom was doing was preventing anyone from falling in love with any of the replacement candidates,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cSo, if you don\u2019t fall in love with them, then you disincentivize anyone from voting \u2018yes\u2019 on the recall. That\u2019s the whole play there.\u201d But critics like Paffrath don\u2019t see it that way, arguing that this year\u2019s recall is very different from 2003, the first and last time a California governor was successfully recalled. Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger ran as a moderate that year and was ushered into office after voters ousted the unpopular Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. A Q&A about the California recall with the man who helped Schwarzenegger win the last one \u201cThere is no Arnold on the ballot this time \u2013 there\u2019s nobody with that broad love that Arnold had when he went in,\u201d Paffrath said. \u201cI think the 2003 election is their excuse, but it\u2019s mostly motivated out of selfishness to keep Gavin,\u201d Paffrath said of Newsom and his team. There are nearly two-dozen replacement candidates who aren\u2019t aligned with the Republican Party, but Newsom\u2019s team argues that urging voters to skip question two is the only way to prevent a Republican takeover of California. When Davis was recalled in 2003, there had been another well-known Democrat on the ballot. Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante had entered the race as the backup option for Democrats, and was castigated for many years afterward (fairly or unfairly) as the spoiler. Though Bustamante said he opposed the recall at the time, the conventional wisdom was that his presence in the race gave Democrats who loathed Davis an excuse to vote \u201cyes\u201d on recalling him, because they could justify their vote by choosing another Democrat to replace him. In that statewide special recall election in October 2003, 55.4% of voters said they wanted to recall Davis. When asked who they wanted to replace him, 48.6% chose Schwarzenegger and 31.5% chose Bustamante. Even if early ballot return data suggests Newsom\u2019s strategy is paying off \u2013 with Democrats overperforming their registration level in the state as of Saturday \u2013 and Newsom\u2019s odds for keeping his office improving, according to the latest polling, many voters are still struggling with what to do with the second question. About half of likely voters (49%) in a Public Policy Institute of California survey released last week either said they had not decided on a potential replacement candidate or that they were skipping the second ballot question altogether. Of those who expressed a preference, 26% favored Elder while the other prominent replacement candidates were in single digits: former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer at 5%, businessman John Cox at 3%, state Assemblyman Kevin Kiley at 3% and Caitlyn Jenner at 1%. (The other potential replacement candidates were not named, according to PPIC). A quarter of likely voters said they wouldn\u2019t choose anyone or wouldn\u2019t vote on that question; while a similar 24% said they didn\u2019t know. Among Democrats, 37% said they did not favor anyone or wouldn\u2019t vote; while 30% said they were unsure; and 16% said they planned to vote for someone else who is not named in the second ballot question, which could include a write-in. To clarify confusion for voters who don\u2019t understand why they need to vote for a potential recall candidate if they just answered a ballot question saying they want to keep their governor, the California Secretary of State\u2019s office has advised voters that the questions are separate from each other and that they are not required to answer both in order for their vote to count. Despite concerns among Democrats like Paffrath that the effort by Newsom and his allies to get voters to skip the second question could deprive them of a solid backup option, some anti-recall voters said they were unbothered by the strategy. \u201cI read in the news that Newsom preferred for us to send it back with just a \u2018no\u2019 \u2013 don\u2019t even put another choice,\u201d said Democrat Lauren Wood, a 71-year-old singer songwriter who attended Newsom\u2019s rally with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Saturday. Wood said she was trying not to be anxious about the fact that Democrats don\u2019t have a backup to Newsom. \u201cI hope, I pray that he\u2019s not going to be recalled. It pisses me off that we\u2019re wasting this money on a recall when the election is in a year,\u201d she said. \u201cThe horrible, horrible shock was when (Donald) Trump won. So, if that happened, this (recall) could happen. I just hope Democrats aren\u2019t complacent about this.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Social, moral and political pressure is beginning to build on tens of millions of Americans who decline to take safe, effective vaccines against Covid-19, as even some conservative politicians join the persuasion effort amid a dangerous new wave. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top government infectious diseases expert, bluntly warned on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday the pandemic is \u201cgoing in the wrong direction\u201d because 50% of the country is not fully vaccinated. Fauci, one of the world\u2019s most respected public health experts, has been demonized by conservative attacks. But as the Delta variant scythes through the unvaccinated heartland, a handful of conservative leaders are now mirroring his plea for holdouts to get their shots to save their lives. But polling shows that many Americans in conservative states remain deeply skeptical of the vaccine and many intend never to take it, or are highly unlikely to change their minds as the virus \u2013 and a highly contagious variant \u2013 begins to deepen its terrible toll. That reality is causing recalculations inside the White House about a crisis many of President Joe Biden\u2019s top aides had hoped was all but over. Top officials are discussing the possibility of reviving mask guidance for vaccinated citizens in some areas where the virus is raging particularly severely. The prospect of another brutal fall and winter in the pandemic also threatens to detract from the President\u2019s ambitious agenda, haunt his presidency and damage the economic recovery heading into midterm elections that were already a tough challenge. Fauci said on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the vast majority of American deaths in a worsening pandemic would come among those who have delayed getting their injections. \u201cThis is an issue predominantly among the unvaccinated, which is the reason why we\u2019re out there, practically pleading with the unvaccinated people to go out and get vaccinated,\u201d he told Jake Tapper. The vaccine drive has yet again taken the lid off fundamental political divisions in the United States that remain raw after ex-President Donald Trump prioritized his political prospects over public health guidelines last year. Some conservative commentators and politicians have falsely accused the Biden administration of trying to forcibly inoculate Americans against their will and dismissed the scientific advice of government experts. There are many reasons why Americans will not get vaccinated, including a belief that the virus is not that bad, the hope that rural lifestyles make catching Covid-19 less likely and general distrust of government experts. But generally, the least vaccinated states that are most at risk amid the current resurgence of Covid-19 were won by Trump in 2020 and are where Republican state and local leaders have been most resistant to social distancing measures. 'Sore loser' Trump reaps fruits of election lies in Arizona The former President, despite claiming rightful credit for his administration\u2019s role in developing highly effective vaccines, did \u201crecommend\u201d to his supporters at a teeming Arizona rally on Saturday that they get their shots. But he also showed that he was unwilling to spend political capital on an issue that might put him at odds with the base voters on whom he relies for a comeback. \u201cI also believe in your freedoms 100%,\u201d Trump said, giving indirect blessing to those who spurn the vaccines. He further sabotaged the public health effort by claiming that the reason people were not taking advantage of it was because of his successor. \u201cBecause they don\u2019t trust the President, people aren\u2019t doing it,\u201d Trump said. No one has sowed more distrust in the Biden administration than Trump himself with his endless and false claims of election fraud. There is a risk to upping pressure on Americans who are reluctant to get vaccinated. Millions of conservative voters turned to Trump because they believed they were being victimized by \u201celite\u201d officials, experts and journalists seeking to impose their views and values on what they saw as their own traditional American cultural customs. This impression, fostered by years of conservative media propaganda, could provide another rich pool of anger for the ex-President to exploit if it is deepened by new vaccine controversies. As with masking, the issue of vaccines gets to the core question of American freedoms and the extent to which an individual\u2019s interests should remain sacrosanct even if their actions put the rest of the community at risk. Vaccine skeptics argue that the government should have no power to prevent them visiting their favorite bar or restaurant, whatever their personal choice on the vaccine. Americans who are vaccinated, however, question why those who won\u2019t get the shot are not willing to help end the pandemic for everyone, amid fears that high levels of virus could spawn new variants resistant to vaccines. While public health guidance suggests that most vaccinated Americans are protected from Covid-19, there are breakthrough infections \u2013 even if almost all of those fully vaccinated will not get seriously ill or die. And children under 12, who cannot yet be vaccinated, are vulnerable \u2013 especially in disease hotspots \u2013 as are immunocompromised people who cannot get the vaccine. The likely political price that Biden and other leaders would face in trying to introduce vaccine passports in order to enter restaurants, theaters and other public places, means such an idea is probably a non-starter in the US. In fact, some Republicans \u2013 like Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, where Covid infections are surging \u2013 have already outlawed such steps. But as the potential toll of the latest Covid surge becomes clear, more conservative leaders are speaking up publicly in support of vaccines \u2014 and even conservative media pundits are getting on board after months spewing misinformation about the government vaccine effort. Several Republican governors have strongly criticized people in their own states who won\u2019t go ahead and get vaccinated, including Kay Ivey of Alabama and Jim Justice of West Virginia. Now, former Trump White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who is running for governor in Arkansas, has publicly joined the pro-vaccine camp with an opinion article in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaper over the weekend. She noted that 98% of those hospitalized in her state and 99% of those who had recently died from Covid were unvaccinated. \u201cMany of our hospitals are now dangerously close to maximum capacity due to rising COVID cases, and the heroic doctors and nurses who have stood on the frontlines of the pandemic need the ability to treat patients with other serious illnesses and emergencies as well,\u201d Sanders wrote. As Covid cases rise, some conservatives make surprising course correction on vaccine ahead of 2022 midterms But her endorsement of vaccines was preceded by a volley of attacks on Democrats, Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Fauci and media organizations she accused of damaging confidence in vaccines \u2014 even though the conservative media machine has been pushing misinformation for months. It was a reminder of the political hoops that Republican politicians must now navigate in order to take a position based on facts \u2014 the effectiveness of vaccines \u2014 while trying not being seen as caving into what their constituents perceive as liberal experts and journalists. The GOP governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, described the reason why the state\u2019s new Covid infections are shooting through the roof on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThis is a pivotal moment in our race against the Covid virus. We have school coming up. We have a lot of sports activities that people are expecting and anxious about,\u201d Hutchinson told Tapper. \u201cAnd what\u2019s holding us back is a low vaccination rate.\u201d But Hutchinson, again revealing the dicey political ground facing Republicans, defended his decision to approve a ban on state and local officials ordering face mask mandates \u2014 saying that at the time, the virus was at low levels. \u201cPeople knew exactly what to do. They were capable of making their decisions,\u201d Hutchinson said. The ban passed both chambers of the Arkansas legislature in April and makes exceptions for private business. He did say, however, that conservative principles that allow for local control would allow officials to consider mask mandates, based on vaccination rates. As new cases of Covid-19 rise across the country, Arkansas recorded 11,748 new infections and 56 new deaths over the last week \u2013 a positivity rate of 19.32%, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. While pleading with citizens to get vaccinated for their own good, Hutchinson said that he wouldn\u2019t consider a vaccine mandate \u201cbecause that would even cause a greater reaction of negativity toward the government, and then imposition on freedom.\u201d Such reasoning is why such a move on the federal level is also all but unthinkable. A Friday Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll among American adults yet to get a vaccine found that 45% say they will definitely not get the shots and 35% say they probably will not. Such data explains why many experts believe that calls by national political figures like Biden are likely to be ineffective in boosting vaccination rates. Trusted community figures like doctors and faith leaders may have better success in bolstering vaccine take-up. And there may also be a more direct role for businesses and educational organizations. \u201cIf someone doesn\u2019t want to get vaccinated, I have no desire to hold them down and to force them to be vaccinated but they should make sure that they don\u2019t harm others,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University. \u201cThey either get the jab or they have to get two tests per week; they have to mask up. But we should absolutely make sure that if you make a decision not to be vaccinated that you just have no right to go unmasked and unvaccinated in a crowded work place,\u201d Gostin said on \u201cSmerconish\u201d on CNN on Saturday. \u201cWe need to make being vaccinated the default, the easy choice.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The top US military officer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley, was so shaken that then-President Donald Trump and his allies might attempt a coup or take other dangerous or illegal measures after the November election that Milley and other top officials informally planned for different ways to stop Trump, according to excerpts of an upcoming book obtained by CNN. The book, from Pulitzer Prize-winning Washington Post reporters Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, describes how Milley and the other Joint Chiefs discussed a plan to resign, one-by-one, rather than carry out orders from Trump that they considered to be illegal, dangerous or ill-advised. \u201cIt was a kind of Saturday Night Massacre in reverse,\u201d Leonnig and Rucker write. The book, \u201cI Alone Can Fix It,\u201d scheduled to be released next Tuesday, chronicles Trump\u2019s final year as president, with a behind-the-scenes look at how senior administration officials and Trump\u2019s inner circle navigated his increasingly unhinged behavior after losing the 2020 election. The authors interviewed Trump for more than two hours. The book recounts how for the first time in modern US history the nation\u2019s top military officer, whose role is to advise the president, was preparing for a showdown with the commander in chief because he feared a coup attempt after Trump lost the November election. The authors explain Milley\u2019s growing concerns that personnel moves that put Trump acolytes in positions of power at the Pentagon after the November 2020 election, including the firing of Defense Secretary Mark Esper and the resignation of Attorney General William Barr, were the sign of something sinister to come. Milley spoke to friends, lawmakers and colleagues about the threat of a coup, and the Joint Chiefs chairman felt he had to be \u201con guard\u201d for what might come. \u201cThey may try, but they\u2019re not going to f**king succeed,\u201d Milley told his deputies, according to the authors. \u201cYou can\u2019t do this without the military. You can\u2019t do this without the CIA and the FBI. We\u2019re the guys with the guns.\u201d In the days leading up to January 6, Leonnig and Rucker write, Milley was worried about Trump\u2019s call to action. \u201cMilley told his staff that he believed Trump was stoking unrest, possibly in hopes of an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act and call out the military.\u201d Milley viewed Trump as \u201cthe classic authoritarian leader with nothing to lose,\u201d the authors write, and he saw parallels between Adolf Hitler\u2019s rhetoric as a victim and savior and Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud. \u201cThis is a Reichstag moment,\u201d Milley told aides, according to the book. \u201cThe gospel of the F\u00fchrer.\u201d Ahead of a November pro-Trump \u201cMillion MAGA March\u201d to protest the election results, Milley told aides he feared it \u201ccould be the modern American equivalent of \u2018brownshirts in the streets,\u2019\u201d referring to the pro-Nazi militia that fueled Hitler\u2019s rise to power. Milley will not publicly address the issues raised in the book, a defense official close to the general told CNN. The official did not dispute that Milley engaged in activities and communications that are not part of the traditional portfolio of a chairman in the final days of Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to sit in silence while people try to use the military against Americans,\u201d the official said. So while Milley \u201ctried his hardest to actively stay out of politics,\u201d if the events that occurred brought him into that arena temporarily, \u201cso be it,\u201d the official said. The official added that the general was not calling Trump a Nazi but felt he had no choice but to respond given his concerns that the rhetoric used by the President and his supporters could lead to such an environment. Trump on Thursday issued a lengthy statement attacking Milley. \u201cI never threatened, or spoke about, to anyone, a coup of our Government,\u201d Trump wrote in his statement, adding, \u201cSo ridiculous!\u201d \u201cSorry to inform you, but an Election is my form of \u2018coup,\u2019 and if I was going to do a coup, one of the last people I would want to do it with is General Mark Milley,\u201d Trump continued. Rucker and Leonnig interviewed more than 140 sources for the book, though most were given anonymity to speak candidly to reconstruct events and dialogue. Milley is quoted extensively and comes off in a positive light as someone who tried to keep democracy alive because he believed it was on the brink of collapse after receiving a warning one week after the election from an old friend. \u201cWhat they are trying to do here is overturn the government,\u201d said the friend, who is not named, according to the authors. \u201cThis is all real, man. You are one of the few guys who are standing between us and some really bad stuff.\u201d Milley\u2019s reputation took a major hit in June 2020, when he joined Trump during his controversial photo-op at St. John\u2019s Church, after federal forces violently dispersed a peaceful crowd of social justice protesters at Lafayette Square outside the White House. To make matters worse, Milley wore camouflage military fatigues throughout the incident. He later apologized, saying, \u201cI should not have been there.\u201d But behind the scenes, the book says Milley was on the frontlines of trying to protect the country, including an episode where he tried to stop Trump from firing FBI Director Chris Wray and CIA Director Gina Haspel. Leonnig and Rucker recount a scene when Milley was with Trump and his top aides in a suite at the Army-Navy football game in December, and publicly confronted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Are you guys getting rid of Wray or Gina?\u201d Milley asked. \u201cCome on chief. What the hell is going on here? What are you guys doing?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cJust some personnel moves.\u201d \u201cJust be careful,\u201d Milley responded, which Leonnig and Rucker write was said as a warning that he was watching. The book also sheds new light on Trump\u2019s descent into a dark and isolated vacuum of conspiracy theories and self-serving delusions after he was declared the loser of the 2020 election. After the January 6 insurrection, the book says Milley held a conference call each day with Meadows and then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Leonnig and Rucker report the officials used the calls to compare notes and \u201ccollectively survey the horizon for trouble.\u201d \u201cThe general theme of these calls was, come hell or high water, there will be a peaceful transfer of power on January twentieth,\u201d one senior official told the authors. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an aircraft, our landing gear is stuck, we\u2019ve got one engine, and we\u2019re out of fuel. We\u2019ve got to land this bad boy.\u201d Milley told aides he saw the calls as an opportunity to keep tabs on Trump, the authors write. A second defense official told CNN that Milley and the Joint Chiefs met on both January 7 and 8, with some calling in virtually, to discuss not only what happened at the violent insurrection at the US Capitol but also to discuss their growing worry about the emerging \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios. On January 12, they signed a memo rejecting the violence and told troops to stand strong, reminding service members of their obligation to support and defend the Constitution and reject extremism. The second defense official said the \u201cwhat if\u201d scenarios included everything from dealing with rumored unrest at every state capitol to the possibility Trump didn\u2019t leave office. \u201cWhat happens if the crazies take over, what do we do?\u201d was the focus of the discussion and essentially what became a mini-wargame to plan for possible scenarios. There was concern in part about being \u201cready\u201d because they had seen the slow National Guard response on the Hill on January 6. If Trump didn\u2019t leave the White House, it was going to be up to Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security and the US Secret Service to deal with him and related domestic unrest. For the Joint Chiefs, the minute Democratic nominee Joe Biden was sworn in would be it \u2013 he would be the commander in chief at that point and Trump would no longer hold power. The official said that a realistic scenario is none of the chiefs would have resigned. They would have not carried out illegal orders, but they would have made Trump fire them. Leonnig and Rucker also recount a scene where Pompeo visited Milley at home in the weeks before the election, and the two had a heart-to-heart conversation sitting at the general\u2019s table. Pompeo is quoted as saying, \u201cYou know the crazies are taking over,\u201d according to people familiar with the conversation. The authors write that Pompeo, through a person close to him, denied making the comments attributed to him and said they were not reflective of his views. In recent weeks Trump has attacked Milley, who is still the Joint Chiefs chairman in the Biden administration, after he testified to Congress about January 6. The book also contains several striking anecdotes about prominent women during the Trump presidency, including GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former first lady Michelle Obama. The book details a phone call the day after the January 6 insurrection between Milley and Cheney, the Wyoming Republican who has close military ties. Cheney voted to impeach Trump and has been an outspoken critic of his election lies, leading to her ouster from House GOP leadership. Milley asked Cheney how she was doing. \u201cThat f**king guy Jim Jordan. That son of a b*tch,\u201d Cheney said, according to the book. Cheney bluntly relayed to Milley what she experienced on the House floor on January 6 while pro-Trump rioters overran police and breached the Capitol building, including a run-in with Jordan, a staunch Trump ally in the House who feverishly tried to overturn the election. Cheney described to Milley her exchange with Jordan: \u201cWhile these maniacs are going through the place, I\u2019m standing in the aisle and he said, \u2018We need to get the ladies away from the aisle. Let me help you.\u2019 I smacked his hand away and told him, \u2018Get away from me. You f**king did this.\u2019\u201d The book reveals Pelosi\u2019s private conversations with Milley during this tenuous period. When Trump fired Esper in November, Pelosi was one of several lawmakers who called Milley. \u201cWe are all trusting you,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember your oath.\u201d After the January 6 insurrection, Pelosi told the general she was deeply concerned that a \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cmaniac\u201d Trump might use nuclear weapons during his final days in office. \u201cMa\u2019am, I guarantee you these processes are very good,\u201d Milley reassured her. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be an accidental firing of nuclear weapons.\u201d \u201cHow can you guarantee me?\u201d Pelosi asked. \u201cMa\u2019am, there\u2019s a process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will only follow legal orders. We\u2019ll only do things that are legal, ethical, and moral.\u201d A week after the insurrection, Pelosi led House Democrats\u2019 second impeachment of Trump for inciting the insurrection. In an interview with the authors, Pelosi said she fears another president could try to pick up where Trump left off. \u201cWe might get somebody of his ilk who\u2019s sane, and that would really be dangerous, because it could be somebody who\u2019s smart, who\u2019s strategic, and the rest,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThis is a slob. He doesn\u2019t believe in science. He doesn\u2019t believe in governance. He\u2019s a snake-oil salesman. And he\u2019s shrewd. Give him credit for his shrewdness.\u201d The book quotes Trump, who had a strained relationship with Merkel, as telling his advisers during an Oval Office meeting about NATO and the US relationship with Germany, \u201cThat b*tch Merkel.\u201d \u201c\u2018I know the f**king krauts,\u2019 the president added, using a derogatory term for German soldiers from World War I and World War II,\u201d Leonnig and Rucker write. \u201cTrump then pointed to a framed photograph of his father, Fred Trump, displayed on the table behind the Resolute Desk and said, \u2018I was raised by the biggest kraut of them all.\u2019\u201d Trump, through a spokesman, denied to the authors making these comments. After January 6, Milley participated in a drill with military and law enforcement leaders to prepare for the January 20 inauguration of President Joe Biden. Washington was on lockdown over fears that far-right groups like the Proud Boys might try to violently disrupt the transfer of power. Milley told a group of senior leaders, \u201cHere\u2019s the deal, guys: These guys are Nazis, they\u2019re boogaloo boys, they\u2019re Proud Boys. These are the same people we fought in World War II. We\u2019re going to put a ring of steel around this city and the Nazis aren\u2019t getting in.\u201d Trump did not attend the inauguration, in a notable break with tradition, and the event went off without incident. As the inauguration ceremony ended, Kamala Harris, who had just been sworn in as vice president, paused to thank Milley. \u201cWe all know what you and some others did,\u201d she said, according to the authors. \u201cThank you.\u201d The book ends with Milley describing his relief that there had not been a coup, thinking to himself, \u201cThank God Almighty, we landed the ship safely.\u201d Milley expressed his relief in the moments after Biden was sworn in, speaking to the Obamas sitting on the inauguration stage. Michelle Obama asked Milley how he was feeling. \u201cNo one has a bigger smile today than I do,\u201d Milley said, according to Leonnig and Rucker. \u201cYou can\u2019t see it under my mask, but I do.\u201d CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Liz Cheney has a strong admonition for House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy: any Republican still challenging the legitimacy of the 2020 election results or whitewashing the January 6 insurrection is not fit to serve on the select committee investigating it. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we have members who are committed to upholding the rule of law and members who are committed to their oaths to the Constitution,\u201d Cheney said to CNN in her first interview since becoming the only Republican named to the select panel by Democrats. \u201cAnd I would certainly hope that the minority leader will be guided by that as he makes his choices.\u201d While Cheney didn\u2019t name names, that characterization of who she thinks is unqualified could apply to a wide swath of her Donald Trump-hugging colleagues in the House GOP \u2013 some of whom are in the mix to serve as one of McCarthy\u2019s five picks for the congressional investigation into the Capitol riots. Only nine House Republicans joined Cheney in voting to impeach Trump for inciting the January 6 siege, while 139 House Republicans voted to challenge the certification of Trump\u2019s 2020 loss. Of course, McCarthy is unlikely to put much stock in the advice of his former deputy, after he pushed to have her booted from GOP leadership earlier this year for her repeated rebukes of the former President. Now the pair has an icy relationship and are barely on speaking terms. Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s veto power over McCarthy\u2019s picks will hold more sway. But as Cheney embarks on her new high-stakes assignment, her comments reflect a deeply held belief that the investigation into the deadly Capitol attack needs to be as serious, sober and non-partisan as possible. And she\u2019s vowing to call out anyone \u2013 from either party \u2013 who threatens to thwart that mission. \u201cI will absolutely stand for the truth and I will reject partisanship \u2013 wherever it comes in,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s been very clear from the beginning of this: my obligation is to the Constitution.\u201d The moment on January 6 that changed Liz Cheney Cheney\u2019s self-professed dedication to the truth \u2013 not to a single person or party \u2013 is the exact same mindset that facilitated her lightning quick fall from the top ranked woman in the House GOP, as she continually rejected Trump\u2019s falsehoods about the election. But that attitude is also what made her an appealing choice to Pelosi for the select panel, where Democrats are hoping Cheney\u2019s presence will ensure bipartisan buy-in for their work and ultimately help sell a polarized public on their findings. The Pelosi-picked panel of investigators knows they are up against powerful forces, with Trump and some of his acolytes now launching a campaign to rewrite the history of January 6 and twist public perceptions about that day. \u201cLiz Cheney is a magnificent asset to the committee because of her knowledge of national security and her commitment to the constitutional process,\u201d said Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, one of the seven House Democrats named to the select panel. \u201cShe is not a partisan actor in any way, she really is a member of Congress searching for the truth of the events of January 6 and the causes behind them.\u201d Added Raskin: \u201cIt will be up to history to decide whether Liz Cheney is vindicated for her defense of our Constitution. \u2026 I\u2019m betting on history siding with Liz Cheney.\u201d Cheney\u2019s pivotal appointment to the committee could bring her more political headaches back home, where pro-Trump forces are already mobilizing against her. With the investigation almost certain to drag into the 2022 election year, that means Cheney\u2019s high-profile work on the panel will likely coincide with her primary race, offering a steady stream of clips and fresh fodder for her critics. Cheney\u2019s challengers are already seizing on her elevation to the panel, lambasting the conservative Wyoming lawmaker for serving alongside the Democrats. \u201cFirst she goes after Trump, violates his due process with unfounded charges without a hearing, to impeach an outgoing president,\u201d said Darin Smith, one of Cheney\u2019s primary opponents who protested at the Capitol on January 6 and has made \u201celection integrity\u201d a cornerstone of his campaign. \u201cNow she\u2019s throwing her lot in with the Democrats?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think we have any place for that,\u201d Smith added. \u201cLaw enforcement has already taken care of those folks who did wrong. \u2026 I don\u2019t see why she\u2019s doing it. Clearly she\u2019s got some political motivations behind that. My best guess is that she\u2019s going to try to run for president in 2024.\u201d McCarthy's management style tested by his conference's most extreme members Trump, still the most powerful figure in the Republican Party, has yet to endorse a challenger in what is shaping up to be a packed primary field in Wyoming. But the ex-President has made clear that he plans to seek revenge on the Republicans who voted to impeach him, especially Cheney. Cheney, however, said she wasn\u2019t thinking about the potential ramifications for her career when she agreed to join Democrats in serving on the select committee, framing the decision as far bigger than politics. \u201cWhen you have a situation that\u2019s as dangerous as this was, and a situation where President Trump continues to use the same language, continues to make the same claims, that he knows sparked violence. \u2026. I think we just have a duty to not make a political calculation,\u201d Cheney said. While it\u2019s clear Cheney\u2019s vote sparked a backlash among Trump loyalists in Wyoming \u2013 the state party has formally censured her \u2013 the congresswoman is still viewed by some Republicans as the clear frontrunner in the current field. Cheney was first elected to the House in 2016, after a lifetime of promoting conservative values and a hawkish foreign policy personified by her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served in her statewide seat for a decade. The congresswoman recently posted yet another record-breaking fundraising haul \u2013 $1.9 million for the second quarter of 2021 \u2013 as the race continues to garner national attention. \u201cThe people who support her, support her on the committee; the others still believe she\u2019s on a personal crusade against the former President,\u201d said Wyoming GOP state Rep. Dan Zwonitzer, who is leaning toward supporting Cheney. \u201cIt really didn\u2019t blow up anything interesting on the current battlefield.\u201d \u201cWhen/if Trump supports a candidate, things could get interesting, if about 5 of the remaining candidates drop out, but it\u2019s highly unlikely to happen,\u201d added Zwonitzer. Cheney, who has a national security background and once held several high-level positions at the State Department, has attended both select committee meetings thus far \u2013 one in Pelosi\u2019s office and one on Zoom. While the panel is still in the midst of getting organized and staffed up, lawmakers have started some initial planning; they may hold their first hearing as soon as next week with law enforcement officers and others who responded to the Capitol attack. Cheney said the panel\u2019s Democrats have been welcoming and professional, while Raskin said it \u201cmakes perfect sense\u201d to have her on board. Cheney also said she has been \u201cimpressed\u201d by the select committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson. The Mississippi Democrat helped broker a bipartisan deal for an independent commission on January 6 that was ultimately blocked by the Senate GOP. \u201cHe\u2019s carried through in that same spirit,\u201d Cheney said. Clyburn doesn't want a former president testifying before select committee but says Trump should 'if it comes to that' One key question that investigators will have to decide is whether Trump, McCarthy or others should be called to testify about Trump\u2019s conduct and state of mind as the riots unfolded. On that topic, Cheney echoed some of her colleagues on the panel: \u201cThe investigation has to go wherever it goes, and there\u2019s nobody who should be, or who will be, off limits if their testimony becomes necessary or is warranted.\u201d McCarthy, who opposed the creation of both the commission and the select committee, told Fox News on Tuesday evening that he hasn\u2019t \u201cmade a decision yet\u201d on who or even whether to appoint anyone from his side to the investigation, citing a \u201creal concern\u201d about the effort becoming politicized. Cheney acknowledged that having a Republican on the committee could lend credibility to their work, which is why she called it a \u201cclear decision\u201d when Pelosi called her up and asked Cheney to join their team. \u201cMy presence makes it bipartisan, but what is even more important to me is the way that the committee is going to conduct itself,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m very dedicated to operating in a way that really does reflect the gravity of this attack.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Democrats are moving to the middle in recent political tests. Republicans are marching more toward former President Donald Trump and, increasingly, trying to outdo themselves in their fealty. Kristi Noem, the South Dakota governor, is one potential Republican candidate for president and her speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference this past weekend, with its focus on her hands-off approach to Covid, sounded like the backbone of a conservative campaign. Drawing distinctions with other governors. It was particularly interesting since she compared her own efforts to other Republican governors. Although she didn\u2019t name names, think of Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott of Texas when you read this from Noem: \u201cWe\u2019ve got Republican governors across this country pretending they didn\u2019t shut down their states; that they didn\u2019t close their regions; that they didn\u2019t mandate masks.\u201d Kristi Noem criticizes GOP governors who enacted Covid-19 mandates while accusing some of rewriting their history And this: \u201cNow, I\u2019m not picking fights with Republican governors. All I\u2019m saying is that we need leaders with grit. That their first instinct is the right instinct.\u201d Or this: \u201cDemand honesty from your leaders and make sure that every one of them is willing to make the tough decisions.\u201d As well as this: \u201cSouth Dakota did not do any of those (measures). We didn\u2019t mandate. We trusted our people and it told them that personal responsibility was the best answer.\u201d Note on South Dakota\u2019s Covid deaths: A larger portion of South Dakotans died from Covid than it most other states, according to CNN\u2019s tracker and Johns Hopkins. In South Dakota, 230 people per 100,000 died from Covid. In the United States as a whole, about 185 people per 100,000 died. CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston, who wrote about the speech, was among reporters who talked to Noem after her speech, when she made clear that the entire field will have to wait for Trump to decide on another run. Inspirational. \u201cI think he\u2019d be fantastic,\u201d Noem told Reston and others. \u201cHe gets up every day and he fights for this country,\u201d Noem said. \u201cMost people when they watched what he and his family went through would be exhausted and quit, out of discouragement. And the fact that he\u2019s still fighting is inspirational to me.\u201d The lesson Republicans have taken, then, is that Trump is their inspirational leader and Trumpism is the way. But they\u2019re ready in case he doesn\u2019t run in 2024 and in that case they\u2019re going to draft behind him. Democrats look to moderates. Democrats are learning a very different lesson after Eric Adams, a moderate, won the New York City mayoral primary and Terry McAuliffe, an old school Clinton-style Democrat, won the Democratic primary for governor in Virginia. Adams appeared on CNN over the weekend and criticized Democratic lawmakers for their efforts on gun control. He argued more should be done to control the flow of handguns into US cities. This may be too simple, but it\u2019s certainly worth considering: Democrats are inching to the middle and Republicans are running toward Trump. \u2018Electricity and fervor for Trump is very much alive.\u2019 What Matters asked Reston, who spent the weekend among Republicans at CPAC, for her thoughts on that oversimplification and whether there\u2019s a middle in today\u2019s GOP. Here\u2019s what she sent back: RESTON: There certainly is a sliver of the Republican Party that is exhausted by Trump and ready to move on, but those people are by far the minority. The more that I talk to Republican voters in places like Iowa and gatherings like CPAC \u2013 where the attendees are the true foot soldiers of the party \u2013 the more I\u2019m struck by the fact that Trump isn\u2019t going anywhere. What I hear over and over again from GOP voters is that they have no desire to move on. They aren\u2019t casting about for a new candidate for 2024 or even really thinking about other people who would run. The vast majority of GOP voters I\u2019ve talked to want to see Trump run again. They see his presidency as unfinished business and many have accepted the alternative reality he\u2019s created about the 2020 election. Yes, they like other potential contenders like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2013 who was, once again, the most popular choice after Trump in CPAC\u2019s unscientific straw poll. But they see all these people like DeSantis, Mike Pompeo and Noem as mere back-up options if Trump decides not to run. The electricity and fervor for Trump is very much alive. Attendees literally left the room dancing last night after his speech. So as much as Democrats would like to believe that Trump is a \u201chas-been\u201d or a figure of the past \u2013 they are fundamentally misunderstanding the mindset of the GOP today.\u201d There were leaders of fringe groups like the Oath Keepers who were involved in the January 6 riot at the Capitol in attendance as well. Tim Pawlenty, the former Republican governor of Minnesota who is not actively running for anything and has called on his party to evolve, was asked about CPAC on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Monday and he tried to equate extremists on the right to extremists on the left. \u201cThe Republican party does not want to become the party of, you know, extremist folks who have conspiracy theories and are militant and violent, and the same is true on the left,\u201d he argued, although the point here is that Trump, who controls the energy in the party, is intentionally appealing to extremism whereas Biden is talking about the need for unity. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disservice to the debate to say there\u2019s only crazy militant people on the right, said Pawlenty. \u201cThere\u2019s also crazy militant people on the left, and the rest of us in a democracy have to be united enough and common \u2013 have enough common sense to say we\u2019re not embracing any of that, right or left, in who we choose as leaders and how we govern our country.\u201d   10 seats most likely to flip in 2022. Americans get their next say in who controls the national government in about sixteen months, when control of the House and Senate are  up for grabs. CNN\u2019s Simone Pathe published her latest in a series of periodic check-ins on the political map. Her list is of the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip from one party to the other. But only eight of them are considered to be competitive at the moment, according to Inside Elections. Four of those are controlled by Democrats at the moment and four are controlled by Republicans. Pathe\u2019s slightly larger list features two additional retiring Republicans in Ohio and Missouri. Each of these races will be shaped in the coming months as primaries develop. Both parties will have important decisions to make. Top pickup opportunity for Democrats, per Pathe: Pennsylvania \u2013 where GOP Sen. Pat Toomey is not running for another term \u2013 remains the seat most likely to flip, in large part, because it\u2019s an open seat in a state that Biden carried last fall. And while this race may come down to whatever the national environment looks like next year, Democrats regard it as their top pick up opportunity \u2013 even if they don\u2019t yet know who their candidate is going to be. She outlines a crowded Democratic field and notes two names: Conor Lamb, the moderate congressman, and John Fetterman, the progressive Lieutenant governor. This could be an interesting primary. Neither man has officially jumped in the race. The top pickup opportunity for Republicans, per Pathe: Georgia \u2013 Republicans are eager to redeem their trifecta of recent losses here. But they\u2019re still in a waiting game when it comes to who will avenge the loss to Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, who\u2019s now running for a full six-year term. That\u2019s because Herschel Walker, encouraged by Trump to run, continues to have a freezing effect on the field. Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black announced his candidacy in early June, becoming one of the most prominent candidates so far, while other Republicans have been reluctant to jump into the race if they know someone else will have Trump\u2019s backing. Former Rep. Doug Collins, for example, already passed on a run. Walker, who lives in Texas, teased a campaign with a June 17 video of him revving the engine of a car with Peach State license plates (in a garage). \u201cI\u2019m getting ready,\u201d the former NFL running back said. Trump said in a radio interview last week that Walker told him he\u2019s decided to run. GOP strategists, however, are nervous about a risky candidate jeopardizing a must-win seat. Those who want to be in Republican politics are finding a way to talk the talk. Revisionist history. J.D. Vance, the Ohio businessman who wrote the best-seller \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d about how he got from growing up in a poor family in Ohio to Yale law school, is a prime example. Scrubbing his past as he mounts a run for Senate, Vance has had to explain and delete tweets that were critical of Trump. \u201cLike a lot of people, I criticized Trump back in 2016,\u201d Vance explained. \u201cAnd I ask folks not to judge me based on what I said in 2016, because I\u2019ve been very open that I did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy. I think he was a good president, I think he made a lot of good decisions for people and I think he took a lot of flak.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza explains what\u2019s happening here: Look. This isn\u2019t complicated. In 2016, Vance wasn\u2019t running for Senate. Now he is. What he said then was what he believed. What he is saying now \u2013 essentially totally disowning what he said then \u2013 is born of political necessity. That necessity? Kissing up to Trump. The political reality at the present moment, and this has been the case since at least 2017, is that you simply cannot win a contested Republican primary unless you are outspokenly pro-Trump.",

            "article_content": "The House voted Wednesday to create a new select committee that will investigate the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol, in a vote falling mostly along party lines that signals the political fight to come over the panel\u2019s examination of the insurrection. The House voted 222-190 to formally create the select panel. Just two Republicans joined with Democrats to support its formation \u2013 Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Ahead of the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on the floor that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d Congress could not establish a bipartisan commission. Even though the speaker said she was still \u201chopeful\u201d that a bipartisan commission could happen in the future, Congress had to move forward with the select committee. \u201cWe cannot wait,\u201d Pelosi said Wednesday. \u201cWe believe that Congress must in the spirit of bipartisanship and patriotism establish this commission. And it will be conducted with dignity, with patriotism, with respect for the American people, so that they can know the truth.\u201d Pelosi made the move to establish the committee after Senate Republicans blocked the formation of a bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 attack. \u201cOur bipartisan, good-faith proposal was met with a filibuster. Now that Senate Republicans have chosen to block the formation of an independent commission, it falls to the House to stay the course and get the answers they deserve,\u201d said House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson, who is one of the potential candidates to chair the select committee. Republicans charged that the select committee envisioned by Democrats was merely a partisan panel that would be used to attack former President Donald Trump. While 35 Republicans voted in favor of the bipartisan commission legislation, nearly all GOP lawmakers opposed the select committee, including most of the 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January. \u201cI supported a bipartisan independent commission. This is the opposite,\u201d Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, the Ohio Republican who voted to impeach Trump and was the target of the former President\u2019s rally over the weekend, told CNN before the vote. Now the question falls to how House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will approach the new committee. The California Republican has declined to answer questions this week about who he might appoint to the committee \u2013 such as those who voted to overturn the election or have downplayed the violence on January 6 \u2013 or whether he will appoint Republicans at all. After the vote, McCarthy still refused to say if he will cooperate and offer up members to serve on the committee, telling CNN, \u201cIt seems pretty political to me.\u201d He did not respond when CNN asked if that meant he would not appoint anyone. Under the House\u2019s resolution, Pelosi will appoint eight members to the commission and McCarthy has five slots \u201cin consultation\u201d with Pelosi \u2013 meaning the House speaker could veto his selections. Asked Tuesday if she would consider vetoing McCarthy\u2019s selections if they had voted to overturn Biden\u2019s win, Pelosi said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see. We\u2019ll see who they nominate.\u201d If she does appoint a Republican, it\u2019s likely to be either Cheney or Kinzinger. Judge rebukes GOP for downplaying US Capitol riot as he hands out first sentence in insurrection Cheney continued to be mum about any conversations she may have had about serving on the select committee, telling CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s all up to the speaker.\u201d A source familiar with the matter said the Wyoming Republican hasn\u2019t spoken to Pelosi yet about serving on the committee. \u201cIf I\u2019m asked to serve on it, I\u2019m going to consider it. I haven\u2019t been asked,\u201d Kinzinger told a local TV station Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily anything I look forward to doing, but if I thought my voice was needed to get to the bottom of it, it would be something I would be open to.\u201d Pelosi would not say if she has decided to appoint a Republican to the select committee when speaking at a news conference ahead of the vote. \u201cI will be making whatever statement I make about the select committee when I do and that is not right now,\u201d she said. New York Rep. John Katko, the top Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee who negotiated the bipartisan agreement for the independent commission, criticized the select committee on Monday and said he did not envision serving on it if he was asked. As members of Congress debated the select committee, officers injured during the January 6 attack listened from the gallery. Among the US Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department members in attendance were USCP Officer Harry Dunn, MPD Officer Michael Fanone, MPD Officer Daniel Hodges, MPD Officer Abdulkadir Abdi, MPD Officer Carlton Wilhoit III and the mother and partner of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died the day after the insurrection. \u201cGlad that it passed but surprised by how close it was,\u201d Dunn told CNN after the vote. \u201cI think we have a lot more coming together to do as a country.\u201d Fanone said he was \u201cshocked but not surprised\u201d by the vote. \u201cI mean 190 votes against a special committee? Again, like I understand the political argument here, that it\u2019s a special committee and it\u2019s political in nature. I see the speaker as having exhausted every other means of investigating (the) January 6 insurrection. What was she left to do other than to ignore it, which is just not enough.\u201d Speaking with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on \u201cDon Lemon Tonight\u201d later Wednesday, Fanone lamented the Republican Party\u2019s loyalty to Trump as he stressed the need for a full accounting of the Capitol attack. GOP lawmakers, he said, have been given \u201cample opportunities to have an exit ramp from the previous administration, and they\u2019ve chose to embrace that administration \u2013 and doing so on the backs of hundreds of police officers that responded to the insurrection, which was incited by that President and his supporters on January 6.\u201d The two Republicans who backed the select committee, Kinzinger and Cheney, say they would have preferred the bipartisan commission to the House-led panel, but they argued that a thorough examination of the January 6 insurrection was necessary. \u201cI believe this select committee is our only remaining option. I will vote to support it,\u201d Cheney said in a statement explaining her vote. \u201cAs I have said, I believe a bipartisan independent commission is the best approach \u2014 and although the House was able to pass the measure, it was blocked by the Senate. Today, I voted in support of the Select Committee because the truth matters,\u201d Kinzinger said in a statement after the vote. Officer injured in Capitol riot blasts GOP lawmaker's behavior as 'disgusting' after tense exchange The House\u2019s select committee is expected to investigate both the security failings of the January 6 attack \u2013 when pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol and disrupted the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s November 2020 victory \u2013 as well as the circumstances leading up to the attack. That\u2019s likely to include an accounting of former President Donald Trump\u2019s role spreading lies about the election being stolen, as well as some Republican lawmakers who supported efforts to overturn the election. The committee could also examine McCarthy\u2019s conversation with Trump by phone as the attack was unfolding. Thompson, who is seen as possible chair of the select committee, told CNN that evidence-gathering from members of Congress \u2013 including McCarthy \u2013 will be critical to gathering evidence by the select committee. He said hearing about McCarthy\u2019s call with Trump is \u201cpart of the evidence necessary to produce a report.\u201d Democrats say that Republicans left them no choice to move forward with a select committee after Senate Republicans blocked the independent commission and some Republicans have downplayed the violence that occurred during the deadly January 6 attack. Besides Thompson, whose committee has already been investigating the riot, another possibility to chair the committee is House Administration Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren, the California Democrat whose panel has also probed the insurrection. This story has been updated with additional developments on Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Six months after their relationship deteriorated in the midst of an insurrection at the US Capitol, Donald Trump and Mike Pence appear to be on the mend. As Pence drops hints about his White House ambitions, more than a half-dozen aides and advisers who remain close to him and Trump told CNN that the tension between both men has eased to a manageable level. That has lent new hope to allies of the former vice president who once worried that Trump, furious over Pence\u2019s refusal to indulge his unprecedented and unconstitutional request to block certification of the 2020 election results, would tank his shot at the Republican presidential nomination if he were to forgo running himself in 2024. \u201cThey are in a better place now. Things have simmered down after being pretty raw for awhile,\u201d said one former Trump campaign official. Pence allies say improvements to his relationship with Trump, however incremental, are a welcome development as the onetime Indiana governor lays the groundwork for a possible foray into presidential politics \u2013 with recent visits to early-voting states, the launch of his conservative policy group Advancing American Freedom, and plans to be an active GOP surrogate on the campaign trail in 2022. To even stand a chance in a crowded GOP primary that does not include Trump, these allies said Pence must have the favor of the party\u2019s MAGA faithful, in addition to social conservative and evangelical voters he helped excite in 2016 and 2020. \u201cI think he realizes that his path if he\u2019s running for president is open if Trump does not run, and that it\u2019s a smart move for him to minimize the distinctions between himself and the former president,\u201d said Club for Growth President David McIntosh, who remains a close friend of Pence. To that end, Pence recently attempted to turn the page on his and Trump\u2019s most high-profile disagreement. In an illuminating speech to New Hampshire Republicans last Thursday, Pence acknowledged that he and his former boss would likely never settle their differences over January 6, when a pro-Trump mob invaded the Capitol \u2013 with some chanting \u201cHang Mike Pence!\u201d as they weaved through the Halls of Congress \u2013 shortly after then-President Trump accused his deputy, who was inside the Capitol complex at the time, of lacking the \u201ccourage\u201d to unilaterally block certain electors when counting the 2020 Electoral College votes. \u201cYou know, President Trump and I have spoken many times since we left office and I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever see eye to eye on that day,\u201d Pence had told the Granite State crowd. Discussions between Pence and his aides about how he might address his and Trump\u2019s disagreement over January 6 kicked into full gear following a speech he delivered in April to South Carolina conservatives, where his only mention of the episode included a brief nod to the \u201ctragedy at our nation\u2019s Capitol.\u201d He and his team had previously agreed that the appearance in Columbia \u2013 his first since leaving office \u2013 was not an appropriate venue for such a headline-making statement, according to a person involved in those discussions. \u201cEveryone needed him to say something so he could focus on policy,\u201d said a person familiar with Pence\u2019s thinking. \u201cThe first speech he gave [in South Carolina], everyone just mocked him for rolling right over it. After that, I think he realized the media wasn\u2019t going to focus on the substance until he got over the shiny object.\u201d Inside Pence\u2019s orbit, his remarks in New Hampshire a month-and-a-half later were widely seen as accomplishing that goal. When Trump appeared in North Carolina two days after Pence\u2019s televised speech for his first public appearance in three months, he seemed to echo his vice president, telling Fox News in an interview at the donor dinner that he was \u201cdisappointed with Mike on one thing\u201d but otherwise considers him \u201ca very fine person and a fine man.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve had a few conversations about it and as [Pence] tells more of that story, they are going to have different viewpoints. But I think it\u2019s an asset for Pence. It\u2019s hard to argue he wasn\u2019t loyal to both Trump and to the Constitution,\u201d said a person close to Pence. Of course, even with tensions easing between the two men there is a distinct possibility that Trump \u2013 widely seen as mercurial and rarely expressing interest in forgiveness \u2013 could still pull the rug out from Pence should his opinion shift in the future. Thus, a second person close to Pence said the best thing the former vice president can do for his political future is to let time go by and hope that Trump stays neutral in the 2024 Republican primary if he doesn\u2019t mount a presidential campaign of his own. \u201cThere is still great affection for Mike inside the base. Most Republican voters think he\u2019s a great guy, even if they\u2019re asking themselves, \u2018Why couldn\u2019t he at least have allowed the election challenges to proceed?\u2019 \u201d this person said. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s fatal but it is problematic, and for that reason, time is Mike Pence\u2019s best friend.\u201d However, a different source close to Pence rejected the assumption that the Republican base is comprised of voters who \u201cdon\u2019t recognize that Pence did the right thing,\u201d even amid polls showing that a majority of GOP voters believe the 2020 election was stolen. While numerous Republican presidential hopefuls \u2013 including Pence \u2013 await a decision from Trump on 2024, allies of the former vice president say his exclusive focus for the next 18 months will be on the 2022 midterm elections. And though it is widely understood within Pence\u2019s inner circle that his efforts to boost GOP candidates next fall are likely to be a net positive if he decides to run for higher office later on, they insist that he has yet to make a decision on his future. \u201cAt some point after 2022, he and Mrs. Pence will get together and discern whether this is something they are called to do and that is what is going to guide his decision \u2013 not what other man is or isn\u2019t in the race,\u201d said a third person close to Pence. In the meantime, Pence has maintained close relationships with key Republican leaders who are involved in the midterm cycle \u2013 from Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, who chairs the Republican Governors Association, to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The former vice president has hit the fundraising circuit to assist GOP efforts to retake the House and Senate next fall and is expected to maintain a demanding campaign schedule next year as he makes appearances alongside various candidates at the House, Senate and gubernatorial level. Pence aides who spoke with CNN would not rule out potential appearances by the former vice president to support incumbent GOP candidates who have drawn Trump\u2019s ire, such as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. The former vice president will also continue to participate in events that aim to awaken the Republican Party\u2019s grassroots activists ahead of the crucial midterm cycle. In addition to his April remarks at a Columbia dinner hosted by the socially conservative Palmetto Family Council and recent visit to New Hampshire, two sources familiar with the matter confirmed his upcoming appearance at the Faith and Freedom Coalition\u2019s annual Road to Majority Conference this month, which will place Pence in front of an audience of the GOP\u2019s most active religious conservatives and donors. Pence also plans to address the Family Leadership Summit in Des Moines this July. And he has been approached by the Club for Growth about appearing in Iowa again this fall to promote Republican policy efforts surrounding school choice, though a spokesperson for the former vice president said the latter event has not been confirmed. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t assist the party in 2022, he would be doing himself a great disservice. He needs to contribute to building out the political apparatus so that he can potentially come back two years from now and say, \u2018I\u2019m running and I need your support,\u2019\u201d said one of the people close to Pence. Outside of these scheduled appearances, many of which have raised speculation about his interest in 2024, Pence has continued to consult a small team of longtime aides on how he can assist Republicans leading up to next fall and simultaneously positionhimself for success in his own political career. From his home base in Indiana, he is in regular contact with his former chief of staff Marc Short, longtime strategic advisers Marty Obst and Chip Saltsman, and remains close with Paul Teller, a former White House legislative affairs official who now serves as executive director of Pence\u2019s advocacy group AAF; Devin O\u2019Malley, his former press secretary in the White House; and Nick Ayers, an elusive Georgia-based Republican operative who preceded Short as Pence\u2019s chief of staff before exiting the Trump administration at the end of 2018. Pence allies say he has actively encouraged his closest advisers to pursue their own ventures and careers since there is no reason to build out a large political team until he has made a decision on 2024 and believes that their work in the meantime \u2013 as consultants to various GOP campaigns or, in Short\u2019s case, as the founder of a new anti-tax group targeting President Joe Biden and Democratic candidates \u2013 ultimately benefits him, too. \u201cYou hear so often in politics about people who are bad to their staff and Pence just isn\u2019t that kind of boss. He keeps his loyalists close and has a giving spirit, so he doesn\u2019t have to ask people to do things for him. They just do,\u201d said one of the people close to Pence. Despite a recent uptick in Trump\u2019s public expressions of interest in 2024, several Pence allies said they do not believe the former president will ultimately enter the GOP presidential primary. One of the people close to Pence even suggested privately that the former vice president might benefit politically if Trump is indicted, as it would provide him with an opportunity to prove his loyalty to the former president in a post-January 6 landscape. Trump is facing multiple criminal and civil investigations, including a criminal probe in New York that has led to the empaneling of a grand jury. \u201cHe can go out there and say, \u2018this is a witch hunt\u2019 and repair his relationship with Trump supporters who remain skeptical of him,\u201d the person said. To prepare for a scenario in which Trump doesn\u2019t run, Pence has been crafting a pitch to voters that communicates his allegiance to the former president by underscoring their policy accomplishments and time in office together, and leans into emerging cultural issues that are resonating intensely with Republican voters. \u201cIt is past time for America to discard the left-wing myth of systemic racism,\u201d Pence told the crowd in New Hampshire last week, panning a new trend in K-12 public education known as \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d which teaches students about racism and inequality in the US and which its critics claim contains Marxist ideology. \u201cInstead of teaching all our children, regardless of race or religion or color, to be proud of their country, critical racial theory teaches children as young as kindergarteners to be ashamed of their skin color,\u201d Pence claimed in his remarks. The former vice president has also weaved criticisms of cancel culture into his recent remarks and fundraising appeals. It\u2019s these kinds of overtures \u2013 with their cross appeal among standard Republican voters and Trump\u2019s core supporters \u2013 that Pence allies believe will set him up for success if he chooses to launch a presidential campaign a couple of years from now. \u201cOne of the things he has as a former vice president is the bully pulpit and the power of persuasion and I think he should use that,\u201d McIntosh said.",

            "article_content": "Moments after being demoted by her Republican colleagues, Rep. Liz Cheney vowed to drag her party out of Donald Trump\u2019s clutches. Judging by the truth-mocking antics Wednesday of the caucus that turned against her, she has a long, lonely slog ahead. The Wyoming lawmaker is billing her brave stand against the former President\u2019s stolen election lies as the beginning of a new quest to restore the GOP\u2019s respect for the rule of law, the Constitution, orthodox conservatism and civility \u2013 all of which were crushed by the ex-President. But it\u2019s far from clear that the Republican Party can be saved or that it particularly wants to be, and any evolution away from its new populist, nationalist Trump personality cult may be the work of many years. Many have tried and all have failed to counter the former reality star\u2019s hostile takeover of the party since he descended his golden escalator at Trump Tower in 2015. Some, like former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, saw their presidential ambitions fade. Others, like Arizona\u2019s Sen Jeff Flake, were driven out of politics entirely. Some, like Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, couldn\u2019t beat Trump so they joined him. So Cheney, who will, in the short term at least, get a national platform to try to build a viable anti-Trump Republican movement, has her work cut out. \u201cI intend to be the leader, one of the leaders, in a fight to help to restore our party,\u201d Cheney said in an interview that\u2019s airing in full on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show Thursday. Cheney\u2019s decision to sacrifice her career for her principles and in defense of truth will not quickly be forgotten by history. Yet the events in Washington within hours of the House GOP vote to strip Cheney of her No. 3 House leadership spot \u2013 a way station on a route that some experts thought might end in the speaker\u2019s chair \u2013 showed that her restoration project has launched from unpromising beginnings. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy went directly from the meeting that purged Cheney to talks with President Joe Biden and other congressional leaders at the White House. He emerged to utter the kind of bald-faced falsehood that shows that truth is a valueless currency in his party.   \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election,\u201d McCarthy told reporters. The comment was a sign that not only has the Californian anchored his caucus to Trump in his quest to win back the House in next year\u2019s midterm elections but he\u2019s also beginning to behave like him. The entire move to oust Cheney was based on her refusal to stop pointing out Trump\u2019s continued lies about a stolen election. McCarthy himself was among 139 House Republicans who objected to Electoral College counts on the day that Trump\u2019s insurrectionist mob invaded the US Capitol. And rarely a day goes by without the ex-President spreading new lies about what happened. It\u2019s not just in Washington that the legitimacy of the 2020 vote is constantly questioned. A sham recount of votes is underway by pro-Trump Republicans in Arizona, despite multiple officials and courts rejecting claims of fraud. And Republican lawmakers all over the country are passing laws that make it harder to vote based on the ex-President\u2019s lies that millions of his voters now believe. Another problem for Cheney and those who want to restore their party is that the former President\u2019s deceitful brand of politics has taken over. Trump may have left Washington, but the stunt politics in which he schooled his Capitol Hill lieutenants is still going strong. Several members who took part in the meeting that got rid of Cheney put on a display of Trump-style perfidy at a subsequent committee hearing on Wednesday into the sacking of the Capitol that their hero incited on January 6. \u201cThere was no insurrection,\u201d said Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican who said the invading mob could have been mistaken for tourists. Another Trump fan, Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, said the crowd was full of \u201cpeaceful patriots\u201d and another, Georgia\u2019s Rep. Jody Hice, suggested outside agitators were to blame for the violence. Takeaways from a day of congressional Republicans embracing Trump and downplaying the US Capitol riot The comments were symptomatic of how the GOP\u2019s rejection of truth and facts makes it impossible for Congress to deal with grave national issues \u2013 like the question of how the insurrection was able to happen. The famous quote attributed to the late Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York about people being entitled to their own opinions but not their own facts was once funny. Now it\u2019s a depressing commentary on a Congress living in parallel realities. While Cheney\u2019s warning that Trump represents a threat to US democracy with his continuing lies about a stolen election was a chilling and historic moment, there is little evidence that his voters \u2013 who turned out in droves even during a pandemic to his election rallies and thrill at his rhetoric \u2013 are preoccupied with preserving US institutions. In fact, Trump\u2019s autocratic persona is a selling point to those who love him and many believe his warnings that a \u201cdeep state\u201d system is hopelessly corrupted against them. The former President has always been willing to use insults and personal mockery to demean his enemies. The conduct of some Republicans is another indicator of his continuing resonance in a party Cheney wants to reform. \u201cNa na na na, na na na na, hey hey, goodbye Liz Cheney,\u201d North Carolina\u2019s Rep. Madison Cawthorn tweeted. And the ascendency of Trump-style Republicans in the caucus like Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia show that the appeal of classic establishment conservatives like the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney may be limited. \u201cLiz Cheney is the GOP of the past. We are not going back,\u201d Boebert tweeted on Wednesday after the vote against Cheney. Cheney\u2019s hopes of building a genuine anti-Trump movement that makes a vigorous conservative attack on Biden\u2019s ambitious policies are also handicapped by the former President\u2019s bond with GOP voters. McCarthy\u2019s decision to strongly ally his caucus with Trump as he launches a midterm election campaign and the unwillingness of most Republicans to speak out against Trump are not taking place in a vacuum. Politicians have an innate understanding of opinion in their own districts, especially when it comes to their own survival. We just witnessed another major turning point in US political history There are some slim signs of hope for a new generation of Never Trumpers. An NBC News poll taken at the end of Biden\u2019s first 100 days in office found that the ex-President\u2019s approval rating may be easing among GOP voters. Some 44% of Republicans said they are more supporters of Trump than of the party. But 50% said they were more supporters of the party than of Trump. The former President\u2019s overall approval rating of just 32% was also a reminder of the damage that promoting Trump could do in a wider electorate. Nevertheless, there\u2019s little doubt that if the next presidential primary were starting now, he\u2019d be the favorite. And if he decides not to run in 2024, the maneuverings of potential candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem suggest that the GOP base will have the luxury of choosing a candidate in his image rather than one pledging to re-create a more traditional notion of conservatism. Cheney\u2019s first problem might be retaining her platform in Washington. Like the small band of other Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol insurrection or who criticized him, she is likely to face a tough primary. And if she is forced to build her movement outside front-line politics, her disloyalty to Trump is hardly likely to endear her to the conservative news networks with direct access to the GOP grass roots, who like McCarthy have decided that the former President remains their meal ticket. \u201cWe must go forward based on truth. We cannot both embrace the big lie and embrace the Constitution,\u201d Cheney said on Wednesday. But by its actions, much of her party is showing that it has made the opposite choice \u2013 one that means Cheney\u2019s mission to save the GOP from itself has left her with a small band of allies and an even smaller chance of success.",

            "article_content": "When Rep. Liz Cheney delivered her defiant speech Tuesday on the eve of the vote to oust her from Republican leadership, she brought with her a symbolic token: a lapel pin depicting George Washington\u2019s traditional battle flag. The flag sets 13 stars on a blue field and is said to have flown over Washington\u2019s headquarters during the Revolutionary War, according to Cheney\u2019s mother, the historian and former second lady Lynne Cheney, who gave it to her daughter a few weeks ago. Lynne Cheney told CNN she has had the pin, designed by jeweler Ann Hand, since publishing her 2004 children\u2019s book, When Washington Crossed the Delaware. The pin \u2013 along with a poster in her Capitol Hill office created for her mother\u2019s book with the words \u201cHeroism. Courage. Patriotism.\u201d across the top \u2013 reflect Liz Cheney\u2019s inspiration as she lays the groundwork for an uphill fight against Donald Trump\u2019s influence on the Republican Party, according to a person close to Cheney. She is leaning on the support from her parents, including former vice president Dick Cheney, as well as calling on the history of the country and her own party. \u201cThe nation needs a strong Republican Party,\u201d Cheney told reporters Wednesday morning, following her removal from the No. 3 position in House GOP leadership. \u201cThe nation needs a party that that is based upon fundamental principles of conservatism, and I am committed and dedicated to ensuring that that\u2019s how this party goes forward, and I plan to lead the fight to do that.\u201d In her floor remarks on Tuesday, Cheney made the case that her mission to \u201cspeak the truth\u201d about the 2020 election and Trump\u2019s falsehoods are part of a pro-democracy tradition in America. She harked back to the legacy of Ronald Reagan and the GOP\u2019s role in fighting authoritarianism during the Cold War. \u201cAs the party of Reagan, Republicans championed democracy, won the Cold War, and defeated the Soviet Communists. As we speak, America is on the cusp of another Cold War \u2013 this time with communist China. Attacks against our democratic process and the rule of law empower our adversaries and feed Communist propaganda that American democracy is a failure. We must speak the truth. Our election was not stolen, and America has not failed,\u201d Cheney said on the House floor. In pictures: Embattled Congresswoman Liz Cheney The speech, like her op-ed in The Washington Post last week, are a preview of how Cheney wants to influence the debate after being expelled from House leadership. While Cheney did not reach out to current House Republican members for support ahead of Wednesday\u2019s vote, she is already enlisting the help from alumni of the Bush administration and other conservatives who have already spoken out against Trump. Three people familiar with these conversations tell CNN that Cheney has become more actively engaged with Republicans outside of the House conference in recent days, talking and strategizing with these allies about her path forward. One friend describes the House floor speech \u201cas a model for her path forward.\u201d In the coming days, the next steps of the plan will become clear, including an effort to \u201crally the voices of Republicans who share her view,\u201d another GOP confidante says. Cheney intends to make clear that she is has \u201cno intentions of abandoning the Republican Party.\u201d In the moments before her expulsion from House leadership on Wednesday, as she offered a prayer with her fellow Republicans, Cheney made clear she was committed to restoring the party. Her remarks were booed by some, with applause coming from others. \u201cI promise you this,\u201d Cheney said, \u201cafter today, I will be leading the fight to restore our party and our nation to conservative principles, to defeating socialism, to defending our republic, to making the GOP worthy again of being the party of Lincoln.\u201d That question emerged during her conversations with Bush alumni: How would she contend with all of the praise from Democrats and the media? Cheney has no choice but to embrace it in the short term, but look for other conservatives and longtime Cheney friends to write supportive op-eds and interviews, injecting Republican voices from outside the House into the conversation. \u201cLiz\u2019s full focus is outside the Capitol,\u201d one Bush alumnus and longtime friend of Cheney\u2019s tells CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s where she will make her case about the future of the republic and the Republican Party.

            "article_content": "Liz Cheney won\u2019t move on and stop speaking about the threat to American democracy posed by Donald Trump for a simple reason: It hasn\u2019t gone away. In a short, powerful speech late Tuesday, the lawmaker from Wyoming shamed colleagues who voted hours later to strip her of her No. 3 House GOP leadership post, showing the guts to speak truth to the ex-President\u2019s malevolent power that most Republicans lack. History is likely to remember her remarks far longer than the tortured explanations of Republican power brokers \u2013 like Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California \u2013 as to why she must be purged after pointing out Trump\u2019s lies and dangerous authoritarianism. Cheney spoke in a mostly empty House of Representatives on Tuesday night, after many of her fellow Republicans had spent the day saying it was time to move on from Trump\u2019s insurrection and trashing of America\u2019s tradition of peaceful transfers of power. But she made a public stand, unlike the Republican lawmakers who voted behind closed doors in a voice vote to remove her, instead of a secret ballot that would have put splits in the party on the record. Cheney made a blunt case Tuesday that the party and the country cannot forget \u2013 not least because the peril from the seditious ex-President is still growing. \u201cToday we face a threat America has never seen before. A former President who provoked a violent attack on this Capitol, in an effort to steal the election, has resumed his aggressive effort to convince Americans that the election was stolen from him,\u201d said Cheney, speaking slowly and in devastating clarity. \u201cHe risks inciting further violence. Millions of Americans have been misled by the former President. They have heard only his words, not the truth.\u201d By getting her retaliation in first against her colleagues, Cheney showed that she \u2013 unlike all but a handful of other Washington Republicans \u2013 is willing to stand up to the ex-President\u2019s bullying and debunk his delusional false reality. She gave her speech at 8 p.m. ET, in time for prime-time news shows, but she was also speaking for posterity in spare but eloquent remarks that will embroider themselves in political lore, however Trump\u2019s story eventually turns out.   Her willingness to take on Trump ensures Cheney is headed for a prolonged period in the political wilderness. As well as losing her leadership post, she is likely to face a primary challenge from a pro-Trump candidate if she runs for reelection. She will certainly be alienated from the bulk of Republican voters and media figures who remain in Trump\u2019s thrall. She will have the company of a small group of GOPers who voted to impeach or convict Trump over the Capitol riot on January 6 and repudiated his attack on American democracy. But even before Wednesday\u2019s vote, Cheney has been looking to the next steps of her plan to fight for the future of the Republican Party, enlisting the help from alumni of the Bush administration and other conservatives who have already spoken out against Trump. Three people familiar with these conversations told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny that Cheney has become more actively engaged with Republicans outside of the House conference in recent days, talking and strategizing with these allies about her path forward. \u201cLiz\u2019s full focus is outside the Capitol,\u201d one Bush alumni and longtime friend of Cheney\u2019s said. \u201cThat\u2019s where she will make her case about the future of the Republic and the Republican Party.\u201d Cheney is being ousted despite the fact that she is one of the most conservative members of Congress and is far more authentic in that regard than Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who is her likely replacement. But Stefanik has the essential qualification in the party of Trump: complete loyalty to the former President and a willingness to amplify his lies about election fraud. \u201cI am a conservative Republican, and the most conservative of conservative principles is reverence for the rule of law,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cThe election is over. That is the rule of law. That is our constitutional process. Those who refuse to accept the rulings of our courts are at war with the Constitution.\u201d In the short term at least, Cheney\u2019s action is unlikely to do anything to drive Trumpism from a party it has consumed. McCarthy has wholeheartedly anchored the GOP\u2019s hopes of winning the House back in midterm elections next year in Trump\u2019s continued appeal. Millions of Republican voters, helped by round-the-clock lies from conservative media, buy Trump\u2019s false narrative that the election was stolen from him with massive electoral fraud. There is very little sign \u2013 apart from a few honorable exceptions like Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois \u2013 of any appetite in the party to change its delusional and anti-democratic course. Cheney\u2019s Republican colleagues say she must go because she won\u2019t quit talking about the election. McCarthy said in a letter to members on Monday that it was time to stop \u201crelitigating\u201d 2020. Yet it is Trump, with his constant statements from his Mar-a-Lago resort, who will not put the election to rest. A former President George W. Bush speechwriter, Michael Gerson, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that Cheney\u2019s speech was a recognition that the United States was at a \u201chinge point\u201d that would decide on the future of the rule of law. \u201cThis is a terrible danger. We have one party at the national level that is not committed to accepting the outcome of legitimate elections,\u201d Gerson said. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that you can tolerate in the long run; that is a recipe for edging towards authoritarianism. So I think that it is a stark choice.\u201d Since returning to Washington this week, many of Cheney\u2019s fellow Republicans portrayed her principled stand as an issue that interests the media but has no resonance outside Washington. Given Trump\u2019s grip on conservative activists and the polarization the ex-President sowed in the country to cover up his embarrassing election loss, that may well be true. Others have argued that this is all a matter of politics and Cheney is distracting from an effort to check President Joe Biden\u2019s sweeping liberal agenda. That may also be true \u2013 but it is undercut by the fact she has made one of the most coherent conservative critiques about the new administration. \u201cIt\u2019s not about right or wrong, it\u2019s about the focus of our conference, and focusing on pushing back on the agenda that\u2019s being pushed by the Biden administration,\u201d the second-ranking Republican House leader, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, said on Tuesday. A day after Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa said Cheney seemed to be a victim of \u201ccancel culture,\u201d she walked back her comments somewhat, reflecting the view of many Republican office holders of the need to look forward. \u201cWe should be focused on unity, coming together, and making sure that Republicans are securing seats in 2022,\u201d Ernst said. Senate Minority Whip John Thune, a South Dakota Republican who has stated publicly that Biden won an election that was not stolen, had a warning for his party on Tuesday, as Trump issued new and false claims about voter fraud. \u201cIf we continue to rehash the 2020 election, we\u2019re going to lose the 2022 election. If we\u2019re talking about jobs and economy and national security and safe streets and strong borders and energy independence \u2026 we got a really good path to get the majorities back in \u201922,\u201d he said. Cheney countered criticisms of her conduct by telling her colleagues they had a patriotic duty to speak up, not least because a new Cold War may be brewing, this time with China, and Trump\u2019s malfeasance was playing into propaganda designed to show America as a failed nation. \u201cRemaining silent and ignoring the lie emboldens the liar,\u201d Cheney said, in a passage that seemed especially directed at McCarthy. \u201cI will not participate in that. I will not sit back and watch in silence while others lead our party down a path that abandons the rule of law and joins the former President\u2019s crusade to undermine our democracy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Businessman Glenn Youngkin earned the Republican nomination for Virginia governor after his final opponent conceded the race while ballots were still being tabulated Monday night. A former executive at The Carlyle Group, a global investment firm, Youngkin pitched himself as a businessman and an outsider. He defeated six other nominees through ranked-choice ballots, which were calculated until the final round to determine the winner. \u201cI am prepared to lead, excited to serve and profoundly humbled by the trust the people have placed in me,\u201d Youngkin tweeted. \u201cVirginians have made it clear that they are ready for a political outsider with proven business experience to bring real change in Richmond.\u201d He put a heavy emphasis on cultural issues important to the Republican base. In recent days, Youngkin had picked up endorsements from prominent Republicans Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt. The announcement comes after the party\u2019s \u201cunassembled convention\u201d Saturday, where GOP delegates voted at 39 sites across the commonwealth. Republicans picked the format after months of dispute about the process. The final round came down to Youngkin and another businessman, Pete Snyder. Both supported former President Donald Trump and led the field in campaign spending \u2013 chiefly on ads going after each other as competing \u201coutsider\u201d candidates. They also tried to draw on support from figures in Trump\u2019s broader political world. Several members of Youngkin\u2019s staff are veterans of Trump\u2019s presidential campaigns. He also ran a TV ad with footage of Trump praising him by name during a White House event on trade. Their strongest competition came from state Sen. Amanda Chase, a pro-Trump gadfly who revels in being known as a \u201cfirebrand\u201d and \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d and has a small, loyal following. She finished third and was knocked out of the race at the end of the fifth round of tabulations. \u201cWhile certainly would have preferred a W, I send my heartfelt congratulations to @glennyoungkin on a tremendous race + deserved win.  He + the ticket have my 100% support,\u201d Snyder wrote in a tweet as the final votes were tabulated. \u201cLove you all + our big family that is the VA GOP.\u201d Republicans haven\u2019t won any of the top three statewide positions, including governor, since 2009. Democrats took full control of the legislature in the 2019 elections, giving the party complete control of the commonwealth\u2019s government for the first time in more than two decades. Virginia Democrats will choose their nominee during the state-run primary on June 8. Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe is the biggest name in the field, which also includes Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax, former state Del. Jennifer Carroll Foy, state Del. Lee Carter and state Sen. Jennifer McClellan. \u201cLet me introduce you to Glenn Youngkin: Glenn\u2019s a Ted Cruz and Corey Stewart-endorsed, self-funding, Big Lie believing Trump loyalist who\u2019ll stop at nothing to advance the GOP\u2019s extreme agenda,\u201d McAuliffe tweeted. \u201cWhat he\u2019s definitely not? The next Governor of Virginia. I\u2019ll make sure of that.\u201d General Election Day in Virginia is November 2. CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner and Michael Warren contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "No one is in a hotter seat in today\u2019s Republican Party than Liz Cheney. The Wyoming Republican, who is the third-ranking member of House Republican leadership, was not-so-subtly called out by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (California) earlier this week at a GOP retreat in Orlando, Florida. \u201cThere\u2019s a responsibility, if you\u2019re gonna be in leadership, leaders eat last,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cAnd when leaders try to go out, and not work as one team, it creates difficulties.\u201d When asked whether Cheney was still a \u201cgood fit\u201d for the leadership team, McCarthy responded, \u201cThat\u2019s a question for the conference,\u201d Punchbowl News\u2019 Jake Sherman reported Tuesday. Hours later, former President Donald Trump sounded off on Cheney. Here\u2019s some of what the 45th president had to say: \u201cLiz Cheney is polling sooo low in Wyoming, and has sooo little support, even from the Wyoming Republican Party, that she is looking for a way out of her Congressional race. Based on all polling, there is no way she can win. She\u2019ll either be yet another lobbyist or maybe embarrass her family by running for President, in order to save face.\u201d What, you might ask, has Cheney done to deserve such opprobrium? Well, let\u2019s take a closer look. 1. She condemned Trump for inciting a riot at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. 2. She voted to impeach Trump \u2013 one of 10 House Republicans to do so \u2013 and in a statement explaining her vote, said that \u201cthe President of the United States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the flame of this attack.\u201d 3. She suggested earlier this week that Republicans who voted to object to the Electoral College results \u2013 after the riot on January 6 \u2013 should be disqualified from leading the Party in the future \u2013 particularly as the 2024 presidential nominee. (Important note: There was not then and is not now any evidence of wrongdoing or fraud as it relates to the 2020 presidential election.) Whoa boy! Pretty radical! And not at all conservative! THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Except, wait. Cheney has a 98% score from the conservative Heritage Action group. And a 0 rating from NARAL Pro Choice America. Heck, according to 538, Cheney voted with Trump almost 93% of the time during his four years in office. So what, exactly, has Cheney done wrong? She condemned an armed insurrection against the US Capitol and a President who spoke at a rally hours before, telling his supporters that \u201cyou\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength and you have to be strong.\u201d And who, after hours of refusing to tell the mob to disburse, released a video in which he said, in part: \u201cI know your pain. I know you\u2019re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us.\u201d As for her vote to impeach Trump, you can certainly disagree on procedural grounds (can you impeach and remove someone from office who is no longer in office?) but it\u2019s hard to question the principled decision she made. And yet, Cheney is being barraged on all sides for somehow not being a team player or adhering close enough to party principles. Which shows you just how much of the Trump cult of personality has replaced any sort of actual \u201cparty principles\u201d for the vast majority of Republican elected officials in this country.",

            "article_content": "A White House riding high on a wave of ambition is setting up a series of inevitable tests of whether Joe Biden is promising more than he can deliver. The President\u2019s aggressive pledge to cut US carbon emissions unveiled at his global online summit Thursday is the latest audacious bet in a presidency that is notable for a moderate tone but an increasingly expansive progressive agenda. The scale of Biden\u2019s plans that he will try to sell to the nation in an address to Congress marking his first 100 days next week shows his determination to use the apex of his power to forge a legacy as a generational reformer. Some admirers have already put him in the company of great Democratic Presidents like Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson. But for such praise to be accurate, he will have to pass an agenda that aims to overhaul much of the economy to benefit American workers \u2013 and he\u2019s about to hit a wall of Republican opposition in divided Washington. So while the President has enjoyed a fast start, remarkable success in accelerating vaccines to fight the pandemic, and with signs the economy is stirring, real questions are mounting over his capacity to follow through. A treacherous road lies ahead that will require Biden to convince the public to embrace all of his programs and to make his opponents pay a price for opposing them. That\u2019s one reason why Biden\u2019s remarks opening a climate summit that included leaders like China\u2019s Xi Jinping and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin sounded more like a speech in a Pittsburgh union hall than the blueprint of a leader bent on a costly crusade to save the world. \u201cWhen people talk about climate, I think jobs,\u201d Biden said, billing the fight against global warming as an extraordinary economic opportunity that will put Americans to work capping abandoned oil wells and assembling electric cars. The speech was characteristic of an emerging foreign policy in which Biden seeks to seize back the US global leadership role scorned by Donald Trump, but on terms that benefit American workers, which does not necessarily contradict the sentiments behind some of the ex-President\u2019s populist policies. The summit came with a pledge from the President to cut US carbon emissions by up to 52% from 2005 levels by 2030 \u2013 a significant step but one that US allies fear could be reversed by a future Republican president. The new climate promise follows Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 rescue law \u2013 passed with only Democratic votes \u2013 and a $2 trillion package that reinvents the definition of infrastructure. Next week, that proposal, which is already meeting fierce GOP opposition, is expected to be complemented by an \u201cAmerican Family Plan\u201d that could hit $1.5 trillion. If Biden can somehow leverage those policies into law, his first year in office really would stand comparison with FDR\u2019s Great Depression policy blitz. But with an evenly divided Senate, that\u2019s easier said than done. Biden\u2019s big promises are not limited to the economy. The President added to high expectations from many of the Black voters who helped him win office by forcibly backing a bill to overhaul American law enforcement after an ex-police officer was convicted for George Floyd\u2019s murder this week. After a series of mass shootings, he threw his support behind new gun safety bills that have passed the House, the latest occasion in which he has come out in support of a Democratic priority after previous questions in Washington about how much political capital he would deploy. What could Congress actually accomplish on police reform? Biden has also voiced support for a sweeping election reform bill that is, like the policing measure, awaiting action in the Senate. The bill would reverse many of the efforts GOP-controlled state legislatures have undertaken to limit the vote, and many Democrats believe that passing it \u2013 which would likely lead to all out political war in the Senate \u2013 is necessary to preserve the party\u2019s hopes in future federal elections, not to mention American ideals about equal access to the franchise. So far, Biden has skillfully used his early popularity and goodwill, finally putting in place an organized, science-based approach to the pandemic, to ease the way for his political priorities. His Covid rescue plan was widely backed by the public, allowing him to redefine bipartisanship by arguing that while GOP lawmakers were opposed, many of their constituents were not. Polls also suggest that Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan \u2013 at least at the start of what is likely to be a bitterly divisive fight over its fate on Capitol Hill \u2013 is popular. But while no one could make a case that the start of a presidency born in the worst public health crisis in 100 years and a consequent economic meltdown was easy, the politics facing Biden\u2019s agenda are set to get much tougher. Ultimately, perhaps not this year, but certainly next, the President will likely face a choice on whether to shelve some of the most ambitious goals or to overcome his opposition to removing or amending filibuster rules that allow Republicans to block his proposals by demanding a 60-vote Senate supermajority. At that point, the straddle between more moderate voters in his national coalition and the increasing impatience of progressives in his Democratic Party will be tough to sustain. While Biden did not lay out a plan for how he will honor his pledge on carbon emissions, which will require a significant retooling of the US economy, he repeatedly stressed the need for huge involvement from the private sector. But it is likely that a significant portion of the funding and initiatives for the emissions cuts depend on the passage of the infrastructure bill that lays the groundwork for a 21st century green, sustainable economy. That is where Biden has a problem. It is far from clear that the entire Democratic caucus in the Senate is on board with an infrastructure proposal that splashes funds on projects far removed from the traditional understanding of such a plan. Biden wants to use tens of billions of dollars, for instance, to fund home health and elderly care. If the President cannot get 50 Democratic votes, even apparently uncertain efforts to pass it with a budget tactic known as reconciliation could be in doubt. Infrastructure negotiations: Republicans unveil $600 billion framework as Democrats try to iron out issues A group of Republican Senators on Thursday sought to exploit this conflict with a rival proposal worth nearly $600 billion \u2013 far short of the President\u2019s target \u2013 that takes a traditional approach to repair roads, bridges, highways, airports and public transport. It does not include funding to create new electric vehicles and environmentally friendly projects, or to deepen the US social safety net. \u201cWe see this as an offer that is on the table and deserves a response,\u201d West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said on Thursday, in remarks apparently calculated to play into the penchant for some moderate Democrats \u2013 like her fellow Mountain Stater Sen. Joe Manchin \u2013 to seek bipartisan solutions. The size of the package is similar to a counter offer that Biden rejected to the Covid-19 rescue plan and captures the massive gulf in perception about America\u2019s greatest challenges between Republicans and Biden. Traditionally both sides would get in a room and decide a compromise, which Democrats and Republicans could brand as victory because each walked away with something of what they wanted. But modern politics, where power has tended to be used to the maximum and compromise is near extinct, doesn\u2019t work that way. For Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s Republicans, who are tied to a pro-Trump base, depriving Biden of a win could be a greater victory than fulfilling some legislative goals. That\u2019s especially the case since many of the most controversial Democratic priorities like election reform are likely to move to the center of debate far closer to next year\u2019s midterm elections. And for all Biden\u2019s talk of unity and bipartisanship \u2013 a useful political device that has so far not seemed much in evidence in his presidency \u2013 he has given clear signals that he is not willing to pare down his aspirations. Accepting the GOP offer on infrastructure \u2013 or even one that meets him halfway \u2013 would force Biden to abandon his entire sense that a moment of history has given him the chance of a radical reforming presidency. Democratic push to make it easier to prosecute officers emerges as sticking point in policing bill talks A similar dynamic is playing out over the police reform bill, which is being held up over the question of dismantling qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that critics say shields police officers from civil lawsuits. Civil rights campaigners say the change is crucial to removing the sense of impunity that they feel has contributed to law enforcement\u2019s excessive use of force against minorities, like ex-cop Derek Chauvin kneeling on George Floyd\u2019s neck for more than nine minutes. But senior Democrats understand that the policing issue is also politically fraught \u2013 trapping the party between a core constituency of African American voters and White moderates in the suburbs \u2013 some of whom were influenced in the last election by Republicans\u2019 largely misleading accusations that Democrats want to \u201cdefund the police\u201d \u2013 an attack that\u2019s reemerging ahead of 2022. As part of a compromise proposal, South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott is suggesting a new approach whereby police departments, rather than individual officers, could be liable for misconduct. But some key progressives believe that having the ability to hold individual officers accountable is the only way to change the dynamics between law enforcement and minorities. There are some positive noises coming from Democrats involved in the talks, so an ingenious compromise that satisfies all sides seems possible. But any backing away from overhauling qualified immunity would dismay progressives and civil rights advocates, who believe the Floyd case could and should mark a turning point in US history that helps usher in fundamental reform. And the issue of police reform is just one of a flurry of priorities that will challenge Biden\u2019s own moderate instincts and require the application of relentless, and potentially inflammatory, presidential power.",

Hawley has attacked Biden\u2019s team for being \u201cpro-endless wars,\u201d citing past support for the Iraq War, and calling Biden\u2019s team \u201cwarmongers.\u201d Like Hawley, Trump initially supported the Iraq War, and then campaigned heavily against the war in Iraq in his 2016 bid criticizing Republican primary opponents and eventual Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for backing the invasion. Trump, opposed the war within a year of its start, but it\u2019s unclear when exactly Hawley changed his opinion. Phillip Letsou, a spokesman for Hawley, said Hawley\u2019s views had changed and pointed to his support in the Senate for withdrawing from Afghanistan and opposition to sending additional troops to the Middle East. \u201cSenator Hawley\u2019s views have definitely changed since his school days. If the twenty-year failed experiment in \u2018neo-conservative\u2019 globalism in the Middle East doesn\u2019t convince you that nation building doesn\u2019t work, nothing will,\u201d Letsou told CNN in an email. It does not appear that Hawley campaigned on opposing Middle East wars prior to his election to the Senate, according to a KFile review of campaign events and interviews. When campaigning for the Senate in 2017, Hawley accepted the endorsement of one of the most hawkish members of President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, former US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton, saying Bolton \u201cunderstands the many threats posed to America.\u201d In 2018, when asked about his views on the world\u2019s perception of the US by a local Missouri TV station, Hawley spoke in support of Trump ending the Iran nuclear deal and moving the US embassy in Israel. He did not mention withdrawing from either Iraq or Afghanistan. Hawley has heavily criticized members of Biden\u2019s administration, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken. \u201cWhat a group of corporatists and war enthusiasts,\u201d Hawley tweeted when Biden announced a group of administration nominees and appointees. \u201cTake Tony Blinken. He\u2019s backed every endless war since the Iraq invasion.\u201d But as president of the Yale Law School Federalist Society just over a decade and a half ago, Hawley, then a 25-year-old law student, wrote numerous blog posts in favor of nation building in Iraq, and backing the Bush administration\u2019s \u201cbroader geo-strategic goals\u201d in the Middle East. \u201cHenry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, has an excellent column on Iraq in this morning\u2019s Washington Post. Kissinger understands the importance of linking the security and political situations in the country,\u201d wrote Hawley in one December 2005 blog post. \u201cThat is, we must both train Iraqi troops and use them to suppress the insurgency as well as push forward with the formation of a stable, democratic government,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe also understands that military operations in Iraq must be subordinated to and integrated with our broader geo-strategic goals in the region. Read the piece. It\u2019ll make an excellent primer for the President\u2019s Oval Office address tonight.\u201d Bush\u2019s address to the nation that night spoke of Iraq\u2019s recent election as a step toward \u201ca model of freedom for the Middle East\u201d and warned against an early withdrawal from the country. Kissinger\u2019s column, in which he voiced his own support for the invasion of Iraq, also argued against withdrawing from the county. Around that same period, Hawley was profiled by the New Haven Register in an article on conservative students in Connecticut colleges and law schools. The article stated that Hawley supported a \u201cvigorous foreign policy that promotes democracy.\u201d In stark contrast, Hawley said in a 2019 speech after becoming a senator that \u201cthe point of American foreign policy should not be to remake the world, but to keep Americans safe and prosperous.\u201d In a November 2005 post titled \u201cIraq: What next?,\u201d Hawley wrote on the \u201ctroubling situation in Iraq,\u201d and the \u201cneed for a coherent, publicly-articulated strategy.\u201d  Hawley wrote on the lack of success in training Iraqi security forces and increasing the number of soldiers in the region who spoke Arabic. Citing Weekly Standard founder and editor Bill Kristol in lambasting the term \u201cexit strategy,\u201d Hawley said that people should not be asking when the US should leave Iraq, but how to win the war. \u201cTaking these and other lessons to heart, Democrat Joe Biden has proposed a skeletal blueprint for moving forward in Iraq,\u201d he said about the then-Delaware senator. \u201cLeaving aside self-defeating talk of an \u2018exit strategy\u2019\u2013an easy, empty phrase that as commentator William Kristol pointed out, usually signals an absence of serious reflection\u2013Biden wrote this past Saturday of a victory strategy. He urged the Administration to announce a timetable, complete with specific dates and goals, for training Iraqi forces.\u201d \u201cWhatever one makes of these specific proposals, the time has come for the President to announce a clear, coherent and quantifiable strategy for moving forward in Iraq,\u201d he wrote about Bush. \u201cThe question should not be, When do we get to leave? But instead, How are we going to win? But unless the Administration does something quickly to answer that second question, they\u2019ll have no choice but to answer the first, sooner rather than later.\u201d In an earlier blog post from November 2005, Hawley also offered his thoughts on the film \u201cJarhead,\u201d based on the memoir of the same name from Anthony Swofford about the Gulf War in the early 1990s. \u201cFor those who have endured Sam Mendes\u2019 2.5 hour whine-a-thon about the first Gulf War, Jarhead, in which protagonist Anthony Swofford whines about the danger of combat, whines about the lack of combat, whines about the pressure and then about the boredom\u2013for those who have endured all this, Major Brooks Tucker\u2019s recent piece on the film should come as welcome relief,\u201d wrote Hawley. \u201cMajor Tucker is a Marine. What\u2019s more, he fought in Persian Gulf I, and assures us that contrary to the impression one might form from Swofford\u2019s book and Mendes\u2019 movie, Marines are typically not self-absorbed, unintelligent, irresponsible slackers. Have a look.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The new Georgia elections law signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last week has prompted lawsuits from civil rights groups, a sharp denunciation from President Joe Biden, and calls for businesses to take action against the state. Republican proponents of the law say the critics who accuse them of \u201cvoter suppression\u201d are mischaracterizing both their intentions and key provisions of the law. They claim the law not only makes Georgia\u2019s elections more secure but that it expands access to voting. That\u2019s highly misleading at best. As critics have correctly said, the law imposes significant new obstacles to voting. It also gives the Republican-controlled state government new power to assert control over the conduct of elections in Democratic counties. The law does, however, contain some provisions that can be reasonably be described as pro-voting, and critics have not always described all of the text accurately. Here is an explanation of some \u2013 though far from all \u2013 changes made by the 98-page law. Our research was assisted by the work of Georgia Public Broadcasting political reporter Stephen Fowler, who published a thorough explainer on Saturday. The new law removes the Georgia secretary of state as the chair of the state elections board. (Former President Donald Trump and other Republicans have attacked the current Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, for refusing to accommodate Trump\u2019s baseless claims about the 2020 election.) Instead, the law lets the state legislature \u2013 which has been under unified Republican control since 2005 \u2013 appoint a \u201cnonpartisan\u201d chair of the board. And under the new law, if a majority of the five-member board decides that a county\u2019s elections officials have been doing their job poorly, the board can suspend those officials and replace them with one person the board has hand-picked to serve as a temporary superintendent, with the same powers the officials had. The new law allows the state board to sideline elections officials in up to four counties at a time. A majority of the board would have to decide that the officials demonstrated \u201cnonfeasance, malfeasance, or gross negligence\u201d in at least two elections over a two-year period, or that the county officials committed at least three violations of election law or board regulations in the last two general election cycles and had not \u201csufficiently remedied\u201d these violations. This provision is a concern to officials and activists in large Democratic-run counties like Atlanta\u2019s Fulton County, whose elections administration has been attacked by former Trump and other Republicans. The new law requires each Georgia county to have a minimum of one drop box for absentee ballots. In 2020, when drop boxes were used for the first time in Georgia, the boxes were authorized by special pandemic-related rules rather than by long-term legislation. However, the new law also limits how many drop boxes each county can have, how many hours and days the boxes can be open, and where they can be located. The law says that each county can\u2019t have more than one drop box per early voting site or per 100,000 active registered voters, whichever number is smaller. This provision will dramatically reduce the number of drop boxes available in some large counties. Fulton County, for example, says it would go from 38 drop boxes in the November election to eight in the future. In addition, the law says that drop boxes need to be located at elections offices or inside early voting locations. And it says the boxes can only be available during the hours that early voting is available. (If the governor declares an emergency, the boxes can be located outdoors.) In 2020, drop boxes could be located outside, available 24 hours a day, and open until the evening of Election Day. There was extensive media coverage of initial Republican proposals to eliminate or sharply reduce early voting on Sundays, when some Black churchgoers participate in \u201csouls to the polls\u201d voting drives. However, these proposals did not make it into the final bill Kemp signed \u2013 which actually ends up expanding early voting in many counties for primaries and general elections. Runoffs are a different story, which we\u2019ll get to in a moment. Under the weekend provisions of the previous law, counties had to open for early voting on only one Saturday during primaries and general elections, from 9 am to 4 pm; Sundays were not mentioned. Under the new law, two Saturdays of early voting are mandatory \u2013 from 9 am to 5 pm at minimum and from 7 am to 7 pm if counties desire \u2013 and two Sundays are explicitly made optional. The old law said early voting had to take place during \u201cnormal business hours\u201d on weekdays, leaving counties to decide what counts as \u201cnormal.\u201d The new law sets a specific time period, requiring early voting to be offered from 9 am to 5 pm. However, it also says that counties can open early voting as early as 7 am and end as late as 7 pm if they want to. In the 2020 general election, Fulton County, DeKalb County, Clayton County, and various other Democratic strongholds held their early voting hours between 7 am and after 7 pm, so they would not be forced into reductions. The law significantly shrinks both the overall length of runoff campaigns and the early voting period for runoffs. (Some context: Democrats won both of the US Senate runoffs held in January 2021, which gave them control of the chamber.) The new law sets the runoff election day four weeks after the general election, down from the previous nine weeks. The new law also eliminates two of the three weeks of early voting that used to be required in runoffs. The new law says early voting has to occur at least from Monday to Friday in the week before the runoff election day. It also says the runoff early voting period has to start \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d so it\u2019s possible that some counties will offer more than the single Monday-to-Friday period. But other counties might well not do so. The law makes a number of changes to absentee voting. Notably, it shortens the duration of the absentee voting period and changes the identification requirements for absentee voters. Under the new law, absentee ballots are allowed to be sent out to voters 29 days before an election, down from the previous 49 days before an election. Voters are allowed to request an absentee ballot a maximum of 78 days before the election, down from 180 days. And the applications have to be received by elections officials no later than 11 days before the election, a reduction from the previous effective deadline of four days before the election. State and local governments are now prohibited from sending out unsolicited absentee ballot applications. (Because of the pandemic, Raffensperger had applications sent out to all active registered voters for the June 2020 primary.) And third-party groups can face financial penalties if they mail applications to people who have already applied for a ballot. The law also does away with the signature-matching system Georgia used to use to check the identities of absentee voters. Instead, voters will have to provide their Georgia driver\u2019s license number, the number on their state identification card, or the last four digits of their Social Security number. If they don\u2019t have any of that, they can provide one of several alternative forms of identification, such as a copy of a utility bill, bank statement or government check. Advocates of the change say that this identification system is more precise than subjective attempts to try to match handwriting, while critics note that the new requirements are disproportionately likely to burden Black voters. Another section of the law, which has generated criticism from Biden and others, limits how voters can be provided food and drink in the vicinity of a voting location. The law makes it a misdemeanor for \u201cany person\u201d to give or offer \u201cany money or gifts,\u201d including \u201cfood and drink,\u201d to any voter within a polling place, within 150 feet of the building housing a polling place, or \u201cwithin 25 feet of any voter standing in line to vote at any polling place.\u201d This provision is located in the same paragraph as a provision banning campaign activity in these locations, but the provision doesn\u2019t prohibit only people who are campaigning from giving out food and drink. It says \u201cany person,\u201d not just campaigners. There is, however, one exception: poll officers are allowed to make available \u201cself-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote.\u201d And it\u2019s perhaps worth noting that there is not a prohibition on voters in line buying food and drink for themselves; the provision is about other people providing \u201cmoney or gifts\u201d including food and drink. Again, we can\u2019t list every single provision of the dozens contained in the bill. But here are some others. The law allows the attorney general to create a \u201chotline\u201d for voters to report alleged voter intimidation and illegal election activities. The law does not let counties use mobile voting facilities \u2013 like the two voting buses Fulton County used in 2020 \u2013 unless the governor declares an emergency, and only then to supplement the capacity of a particular polling place where the emergency occurred. The law guarantees that any one Georgia voter can challenge an unlimited number of other individuals\u2019 qualifications to vote. The law says that anyone who shows up to vote in the right county but in the wrong precinct will not have their provisional ballot counted unless it is cast after 5 pm and the voter swears a statement that they cannot make it to the right precinct on time. The law will require a ranked-choice ballot to be sent to military and overseas voters in primaries and general elections, along with a standard ballot. The ranked-choice ballot will be counted in the event of a runoff. The law mandates that if precincts of a certain substantial size had lines of more than one hour in the previous general election, or did not complete voting by an hour after the official poll-closing time in that previous general election, county officials have to reduce the size of the precinct or get more poll workers, voting equipment or both for the next election.

            "article_content": "The leader of the far-right Proud Boys group does not care that lawmakers were terrorized by rioters inside the US Capitol on January 6 as they tried to do their jobs. \u201cI\u2019m not\u202fgonna\u202fcry about people who don\u2019t\u202fgive a crap\u202fabout their constituents. I\u2019m not going to sympathize with them,\u201d\u202fEnrique Tarrio\u202fsays. More than a dozen people affiliated with the often violent,\u202ffar-right\u202f \u201cWestern Chauvinist\u201d\u202fgroup have been charged for their roles in the insurrection, so CNN sat down with Tarrio to hear if he had any explanation or justification for their actions, or if he would now change tack. He gives pointed responses, but then adds lots of caveats. What he has not done is change his mind about the role the Proud Boys played on January 6 or his feelings about the targeting of members of Congress despite the release of so much stunningly violent video. The attack left five people dead and dozens of police officers injured. The day after the attack, Tarrio posted a photo of House members crouched down and hiding, with a caption, \u201cWhen the people fear the government, there is tyranny \u2026 When the government fears the people \u2026 There is liberty.\u201d He told CNN he was quoting Thomas Jefferson, though there is no evidence the third President ever said that, according to his foundation. \u201cWhen they support drone-bombing children in the Middle East \u2026 [and] those people are dead and they\u2019re just cowering because a group of misfits came into the Capitol, I\u2019m not going to be sympathetic,\u201d Tarrio tells CNN. He doubles down, dismissing the specter of a mob that had hammered on doors to the House and Senate trying to get to those inside: \u201cI\u2019m not going to worry about people that their only worry is to be reelected.\u201d Tarrio was not at the Capitol on January 6. He was ordered to stay away from Washington, after being arrested in the city two days prior\u202fto the insurrection on a misdemeanor charge in connection to the burning of a church\u2019s Black Lives Matter banner\u202f in December, in addition to weapons charges. He admitted to both to CNN. He says over and over that he doesn\u2019t support the attack on the Capitol, but he won\u2019t condemn the attackers either. It\u2019s not that simple, he says. \u201cI think condemn is a very strong word.\u201d Tarrio says he understands what got people so frustrated. Donald Trump supporters have felt demonized after being called \u201cdeplorables\u201d and have been angry about protests that have turned violent in places like Portland and Minneapolis, shutdowns due to coronavirus and being kicked off popular social media sites, he says. Some, though not Tarrio, believe the lie that the election was stolen. Tarrio believes members of his organization got caught up in the moment, adding he might have done the same if he had been there. But he is also adamant the group never had plans to storm the Capitol. Court documents show the Proud Boys are perhaps second only to the Oath Keepers when it comes to an organized group facing the most charges. Proud Boys are accused of conspiracy, making threats to assault a federal officer, stealing a police officer\u2019s shield,\u202frobbery, theft and destruction of government property, carrying a dangerous weapon, assaulting, resisting or impeding officers, and removing barriers and fences at the Capitol. Dominic Pezzola, a Proud Boy from New York, used the stolen riot shield to repeatedly smash through a window at the Capitol. Footage of the attack shows the pro-Trump mob entering through that broken window. Tarrio says Pezzola merely \u201cmess[ed] up.\u201d \u201cI just don\u2019t see an egregious [act like] he assaulted somebody or he hurt somebody.\u201d He believes his members \u2013 along with some others in the right-wing, anti-government Oath Keepers \u2013 are being scapegoated because of their notoriety. DOJ and House managers zero in on far-right Proud Boys' role in Capitol attack He says his men \u2013 and they are all men \u2013 were not violent that day and are being charged with felonies for trespassing and interrupting Congress. \u201cThey need a head to roll. They need heads on pikes,\u201d Tarrio argues. \u201cThe FBI and the DOJ [are] using the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers as their go-to, to show the people that they did something.\u201d The profile of the Proud Boys did soar after Trump told the group to \u201cstand back and stand by\u201d when he was asked to denounce extremists during the first presidential debate. The Proud Boys did fundraise and sell merchandise off that mention, and Tarrio seems happy to report that their membership doubled in the days following. But he is unwilling to accept more scrutiny along with more attention. Instead, he is quick to deflect. While happy to criticize the violence sometimes associated with anti-fascist protesters known as Antifa in cities like Portland, Oregon, he won\u2019t acknowledge the role of Proud Boys in the same violent clashes, saying they fight only to defend themselves. He\u2019s even backing down on calling for Antifa to be declared a terrorist organization, not because his loathing of them is any less but because he fears the same classification could be used against his group and others to \u201csilence their freedom speech.\u201d Canada recently did make that choice, adding the Proud Boys to its list of terrorist groups. But Tarrio insists he had changed his mind about Antifa before that decision. Tarrio disagrees with Canada\u2019s designation and says the Canadian Proud Boys are considering their legal options to fight it. Tarrio is close to Trump confidant Roger Stone and even revealed he had been called to testify in front of a grand jury regarding Stone. Stone was then facing seven counts for lying to Congress and witness tampering in the probe to find out if the 2016 Trump campaign colluded with Russia. A jury convicted Stone on all seven counts but Trump later pardoned him.  During that case, an investigation was launched as to whether Stone had threatened the judge after a post appeared on his social media account showing a picture of the judge and what investigators thought could be a target behind her head.  Stone testified that a person working with him on his social media accounts had chosen the image. CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz first reported last week that a grand jury had been convened in 2019. Tarrio said he testified because he had access to Stone\u2019s phone a couple of times to post social media content. Tarrio says he had nothing to do with posting that image. The Proud Boys leader says he has proof that his group never had any bad intentions on January 6. That proof, he says, is in internal communications in the days, weeks and months before the insurrection and is different from the public messages seen on Parler or Telegram. But in the next breath he says he won\u2019t share the claimed exoneration, at least not yet. He\u2019s waiting for the right moment when it has the biggest impact on the cases against his men. He says yes, he told his group not to wear their normal colors for the rally on January 6. But, he says, that wasn\u2019t planning to evade authorities, it was just to trick Antifa. Tarrio admitted he was an informant for the FBI and other agencies after he was convicted in a federal fraud case, but he now says the FBI is not to be trusted and improperly uses its power. He says that after what happened on January 6, though, his group is looking at changing some of its tactics. \u201cI think right now is the time to go ahead and overthrow the government by becoming the new government and running for office,\u201d he says.

            "article_content": "His staff endured racist taunts. His voicemail overflowed with threats and wild conspiracy theories. And then one day, a caller warned that the Christmas Day bombing in Nashville \u201cwas a practice run for what was coming to our polling places.\u201d The abuse and threats hurled at Fulton County, Georgia, Elections Director Richard Barron and his staff in Atlanta between last year\u2019s general election and the state\u2019s high-stakes Senate runoffs on January 5 marked a new low in his 21-year career working on elections. \u201cI used to have a sense of pride about this work,\u201d Barron told CNN. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that I do anymore.\u201d Around the country, election supervisors and the rank-and-file workers who helped carry out the nuts and bolts of American democracy still are reeling from the barrage of threats and the flood of falsehoods they had to navigate as they helped a record number of people cast ballots in a pandemic. The baseless claims of election fraud promoted by former President Donald Trump and his allies may have reached their deadly apogee on January 6, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the presidential contest. But election officials said they still are coping with the fallout weeks later \u2013 as they face voters still skeptical of the results and new skirmishes with state lawmakers over how to run elections moving forward. In Arizona \u2013 where election officials in Phoenix saw nightly protests as they tallied votes last November \u2013 members of the Republican-controlled Senate weighed contempt charges for members of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors, on grounds that they had refused to comply with demands to hand over images of every mail-in ballot for review. Some senators threatened board members with arrest. In the end, the Senate voted against holding the Maricopa officials in contempt, with one GOP lawmaker, Sen. Paul Boyer, breaking with his caucus to block the effort. President Joe Biden\u2019s win in populous Maricopa cemented his victory in Arizona, making him the first Democrat since Bill Clinton in 1996 to carry the state. \u201cSome of our voters are upset with us,\u201d Maricopa County Supervisor Bill Gates, one of four Republicans on the five-member board, told CNN. \u201cThey wanted to see us come out with a different decision when we certified the votes. But to me, there was no choice to make. I mean, the votes were cast. It was a fair election.\u201d Maricopa County officials received death threats after certifying the results, Gates said. Jennifer Morrell, a former local election supervisor who consults with election officials as a partner with The Elections Group, said she\u2019s heard plenty from \u201cdiscouraged\u201d officials in the aftermath of the 2020 election. \u201cThey took on this Herculean task \u2013 running an election in a pandemic. They did it well. There were no major meltdowns, and then they faced this avalanche, this tsunami, of criticism and harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are people. They are mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, grandparents. They are your friends and neighbors, and people are making their lives miserable.\u201d There\u2019s no central repository of the threats local officials faced, and the FBI declined to say how many of these kinds of cases it has investigated, citing the department\u2019s standard practice of not commenting on ongoing matters. But the concerns about violence have grown so great that the National Association of Secretaries of State recently adopted a bipartisan resolution condemning threats against election workers as the \u201cantithesis of what our nation stands for.\u201d In Philadelphia, the threats last November led to police details for local officials, Al Schmidt, the city\u2019s lone Republican commissioner, told CNN. The threatening messages stopped only a few weeks ago, but Schmidt said officials still are working to combat misinformation more than three months after Election Day. \u201cFinding the best way to convince people of the truth has been, I think, a lot more challenging than I would have thought,\u201d said Schmidt. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not really based in fact; it\u2019s based in a belief. And it\u2019s hard to dissuade someone of that belief, no matter how many facts you have.\u201d In key battlegrounds, state lawmakers now are racing to roll back provisions that expanded access to voting, citing constituent concerns about election integrity. In all, lawmakers in 33 states have proposed more than 165 bills that would restrict voting, according to an updated analysis of election bills by the Brennan Center for Justice. That\u2019s more than four times as many bills of this kind that had been introduced at this point last year. In Georgia, where Democrats made historic gains in the presidential and Senate races, one GOP-sponsored measure would undo a 2005 law that allowed no-excuse absentee voting. The voters who would still qualify to vote absentee by mail, such as people 75 and older and those with disabilities, would have to include copies of their photo IDs both when they request absentee ballots and when they return them, under one proposal. Another measure would ban ballot drop boxes \u2013 which became a flashpoint for Republicans who argue they facilitated voter fraud. There\u2019s been no proof of widespread fraud in the election. Barron said couriers who traveled around the city on January 5 to collect absentee ballots from drop boxes were harassed and followed as they made their rounds. At one point, protesters temporarily blocked the facilities\u2019 driveways to keep the couriers from delivering the ballots, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s blatant voter suppression,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really getting to me. The bills in the Legislature seem to be an extension of the craziness we saw.\u201d Georgia Republican officials have defended their legislative proposals as needed to restore voter confidence in elections. \u201cThe proposed reforms are designed to limit abuse of the system while maintaining access for all Georgians and ensuring that their legal votes are accurately and timely counted,\u201d said Georgia Senate President Pro Tempore Butch Miller, a Republican. \u201cClaims of suppression or that we\u2019re legitimizing conspiracy theories are partisan tactics and don\u2019t reflect the contents of the reforms we\u2019re going to advocate,\u201d he added. Barron said it was hard to stomach the threats and harassment as his team scrambled to pull off multiple elections \u2013 primaries, a general election, a runoff \u2013 under extraordinary circumstances. More than two dozen Fulton County workers contracted the coronavirus in one week, he said. \u201cNo matter what we did, no one was happy with anything,\u201d he said. Barron said the ugliest threats have abated but the calls questioning the results keep trickling in. A woman recently left a message spouting conspiracy theories advanced by the Trump-supporting MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. \u201cShe was saying, \u2018I need to watch it because (Lindell) has all the answers as to what happened in Georgia,\u2019 \u201d Barron recounted. Another caller, he said, demanded information on why \u201cadjudication files\u201d were still missing. \u201cI have no idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Barron said, wearily.",

            "article_content": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy began this week facing perhaps the biggest challenge of his time as leader. He emerged at the end of it having survived but not unscathed. While he has a tighter grip on his conference than before, others in the Republican establishment are concerned about the long-term health of the GOP and have sharply questioned his leadership. McCarthy\u2019s task was to keep an angry, fractious conference together in the face of growing animus toward two very different members \u2013 Reps. Liz Cheney and Marjorie Taylor Greene. McCarthy, according to people on Capitol Hill familiar with his thinking, went into the week with one goal: no blood. That meant not taking sides between the establishment and pro-Trump wings of the party. The challenge was to save both wings and keep them unified. To achieve this, McCarthy did what many Republicans outside of the House conference had long criticized him for \u2013 not taking a firm enough stand on certain issues and allowing individual members to drive the conversation, even when they were espousing conspiracies and pushing the lie that the election was stolen from Donald Trump. While some Republicans saw his hands-off approach as a sign of weakness, the style was aimed at keeping the conference intact, even if some of the Republicans\u2019 dirty laundry had to be aired in public. But by Friday, it was clear the Republican leader\u2019s strategy had paid off. The GOP conference was unified and his own position inside it was secure. \u201cYou elected me leader,\u201d McCarthy told the conference at the end of their hours-long meeting Wednesday night. \u201cLet me lead.\u201d The speech was greeted with raucous applause. McCarthy brought Republicans together in part by letting many of his members air their grievances against Cheney for her impeachment vote before getting the vast majority of the conference to support her staying in the leadership. He also pushed the thorny issue of removing Greene from her committee assignments onto the House Democratic majority, which they did on Thursday. For many House Republicans, the episode was a triumph for McCarthy. \u201cHe did a great job, I actually congratulated him today,\u201d Rep. Darrell Issa of California, a conservative, told CNN Friday. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a leader in a conference like this, that\u2019s diverse, and you\u2019re going to have diverse opinions, and they\u2019ve got to try to thread that needle,\u201d said Rep. John Katko, a moderate from New York. \u201cI think they did the best they could under the circumstances.\u201d McCarthy did however manage to anger one key constituent. According to a source familiar, a stir-crazy Trump has spent the last two days livid and fuming to aides and allies about what he views as a betrayal by McCarthy for standing by Cheney and not punishing her for her vote to impeach. This just over a week after McCarthy made an appeal to Trump by visiting him down at Mar-a-Lago and extracting a public commitment that the former President will work to elect a Republican House majority in 2022. Trump isn\u2019t the only Republican disappointed with McCarthy. Many in the establishment were looking for a more direct and stinging rebuke of Greene from the GOP leader. They worry failure to do so has damaged the party\u2019s ability to win by tying its brand to a conspiracy theorist. \u201cKevin never takes a stand, he is always on every side of every issue,\u201d said one influential Republican adviser, who called the episode a \u201chuge embarrassment and failure of leadership.\u201d \u201cDoes he want to be the Republican party or the QAnon party?\u201d the adviser added. For McCarthy, however, it\u2019s a matter of balancing competing views. \u201cThe Republicans Leader McCarthy wakes up every day to fight for are the Republicans in our conference and their constituents,\u201d said McCarthy spokesman Matt Sparks. \u201cOur conference is united and moving forward on their behalf.\u201d McCarthy\u2019s unity play has come at the cost of tolerating and even participating in lies about a stolen election and other conspiracy theories. McCarthy was quiet when Republicans like Rep. Mo Brooks were leading the charge seeking to overturn the elections on Jan. 6, privately greenlighting their efforts and ultimately voting with them on the House floor to discard the electoral results of two states Joe Biden won \u2013 hours after pro-Trump demonstrators stormed the Capitol seeking to stop the congressional certification of Biden\u2019s win. He was also quiet about House Republicans\u2019 legal brief backing the Texas lawsuits seeking to invalidate millions of votes in key battleground states, before ultimately signing onto the effort himself. And he refused to acknowledge Biden\u2019s victory until more than two months after it was clear that the Democrat had won. All of that has given McCarthy a reputation as an indecisive leader unwilling to take a strong stand and willing to turn a blind eye to even the most egregious actions by Trump. But in so doing, he has gained strong backing from the dominant pro-Trump wing of his conference \u2013 with no clear challengers who could seek to oust him from the job or bid to take the Speaker\u2019s gavel if the GOP wins the majority next year. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a favorite of the Freedom Caucus and pro-Trump wing who challenged McCarthy in 2018, told CNN Friday there is \u201czero possibility\u201d he will run against McCarthy for Speaker if Republicans win the majority next year. \u201cI\u2019m focused on winning back the majority,\u201d Jordan said. During the four-hour-plus venting session on Wednesday, McCarthy recalled a story about how he and Jordan were at odds and have since reconciled. And he made a plea to give him the leadership team he needs, including Cheney, to help the GOP retake the majority. Not every House Republican is enthusiastic about McCarthy\u2019s leadership. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a staunch Trump ally who sought Cheney\u2019s ouster, wouldn\u2019t say if he has confidence in McCarthy\u2019s leadership; nor would Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler, a Washington Republican who voted to impeach Trump. On Wednesday, some aired their grievances about McCarthy himself \u2013 namely how he handled his meeting at Mar-a-Lago with Trump. \u201cThere were a number of members that thought it was inappropriate,\u201d Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican, told CNN. There was, and remains, plenty of skepticism from some Republicans of McCarthy\u2019s ability to juggle the demands of an unwieldy House Republican conference. McCarthy is known as a member\u2019s member \u2013 a glad-hander who asks about his fellow Republicans\u2019 kids by name and remembers their wedding anniversaries. It\u2019s a trait that has served him well, first as a member of the GOP whip team and later as the whip himself. And for years, McCarthy has been intimately involved in the House Republicans\u2019 candidate recruitment efforts as well as its fundraising \u2013 meaning a large chunk of the GOP conference is made up of people he directly helped get elected. But the 8-term Californian has not been known as a strategic thinker, especially when compared to his Senate counterpart, Mitch McConnell. Republicans who know him say McCarthy is more inclined to seek conciliation and the path of least conflict. That trait was on display in the deferential way he dealt with Greene. In one conversation with a senior Republican, according to a source familiar with the situation, McCarthy was advised to be very specific with Greene when they met to discuss her future \u2013 to ask her directly whether she still agreed with the controversial comments she made and to go through them one by one. Without a full recant and public apology to the conference, the senior Republican told McCarthy, he would have to remove Greene. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak to Marjorie Taylor Greene,\u201d said the influential Republican adviser. \u201cYou take action and remove her.\u201d But McCarthy was less inclined to do so after he met with Greene on Tuesday. According to one person with knowledge of the conversation, Greene was cordial and seemed to acknowledge she had put the conference in a difficult spot. On Wednesday morning, McCarthy made a final appeal to his Democratic counterpart, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. Hoyer had the votes to oust Greene from her two committees, and Democrats were prepared to do so over her lies and conspiracy theorizing \u2013 including her claim the 2018 Parkland school shooting was a \u201cfalse flag\u201d operation by supporters of tighter gun laws. McCarthy offered this compromise to forestall a floor vote: Given the offense she caused to the Parkland victims, take Greene off the Education and Labor committee and place her on the Small Business committee. But Hoyer declined the offer, and McCarthy was left with no choice. Republicans wouldn\u2019t remove her, but they couldn\u2019t stop the Democratic majority. For some outside the conference, this was a major embarrassment. The Republican adviser told CNN that by not punishing Greene himself, McCarthy was effectively allowing the majority to decide whether a member of the minority party can serve on a committee. \u201cHow embarrassing is that?\u201d said the adviser. Greene would speak to the conference that night, where she struck an apologetic tone that seemed to satisfy enough of her GOP colleagues. But that speech, and a Thursday floor speech before the House vote, did not prevent 11 Republicans from joining every Democrat in stripping Greene of her assignments. But the fear among House Republicans that even more would break and vote to punish Greene was abated. While the midterm elections are 21 months away, McCarthy allies view his actions as trying to prevent a potentially disastrous divide within the party. For McCarthy, dealing with both Cheney and Greene put him at risk of alienating everyone at once. \u201cWe could have splintered really badly this week,\u201d Rep. Cole told CNN Friday. The establishment, including Sen. McConnell and several donors, backed Cheney and wanted the party to rebuke Greene in the strongest of terms. The pro-Trump Freedom Caucus, channeling the GOP\u2019s base, had their knives out for Cheney and circled the wagons around Greene. In turn McCarthy sought a middle path that might satisfy the establishment while validating the party\u2019s base \u2013 an optimal outcome, if it works. Denver Riggleman, the former Republican congressman from Virginia who remains close to many of his old colleagues, said McCarthy is primarily driven by political considerations. \u201cKevin\u2019s calculus is, what does the polling look like in those districts and the fundraising in those districts,\u201d Riggleman said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to read the tea leaves and bouncing back and forth to what he\u2019s hearing from the polling in the districts.\u201d Others say it\u2019s clear the minority leader has cast his lot wholly with the most strident members of the House GOP. \u201cKevin has been co-opted by [Jim] Jordan and the Freedom Caucus,\u201d said Charlie Dent, another former Republican congressman and a CNN contributor. \u201cIf he punishes MTG, those guys turn on him and withhold Speaker votes just like they did in 2015. McCarthy\u2019s failure to punish MTG makes it harder to win swing districts and therefore the majority. He put himself in a box.\u201d McCarthy is also facing significant blowback from establishment Republicans, with some saying his recent moves will have severe consequences for the party and that he has sabotaged his own career. \u201cAny talk of the speakership is now a joke,\u201d the Republican adviser said. But a Republican strategist tells CNN that McCarthy was in no position to simply cast Greene aside, since she has already proven herself to be a strong draw for the Republican base. \u201cGreene has been raising big small-dollar cash and is one of only a few people (Trump base) voters see as fighting,\u201d said this strategist. CNN\u2019s Daniella Diaz, Dana Bash, Gloria Borger, and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Liz Cheney survived to fight another battle but on a raucous and defining day, the appeasement of Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene by House Republicans sent their party lurching further down the road to extremism. The moral crisis in the GOP after Donald Trump\u2019s exit from Washington was epitomized by a showdown that saw Cheney, a lifelong ideological conservative, forced to fight off a challenge to her leadership post after she voted to impeach a President who sparked a violent coup attempt. At the same time, Greene, a belligerent conspiracy theorist who thinks the GOP\u2019s problem is that it lost the presidential election too gracefully, got a pass from colleagues despite promoting a sick stew of QAnon lies and fantasies. The struggle for the future direction of the party exploded in a manic meeting of the House Republican Conference that ended when Cheney prevailed comfortably in a secret ballot \u2013 after she refused to apologize to angry acolytes of the ex-President after choosing the Constitution over Trump.   Greene had earlier learned that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy would not strip her committee assignments \u2013 a day after she was called into his office over her past extreme views and offensive social media posts. The Democratic-led House is however expected to act where McCarthy failed in a floor vote on Thursday. The fact that Cheney has faced more criticism from her colleagues than Greene in recent days reflects how the GOP\u2019s traditional values are under siege and the vast power that extremists and conspiracy theories welcomed into the party by Trump are accumulating. For weeks, and especially following the insurrection incited by Trump on January 6, the Republican Party has been locked in a prolonged duel between those swearing loyalty to their leader in exile, and others who want to move on from his anti-democratic tenure. But Wednesday\u2019s leadership punt on Greene, a first term member from Georgia, made this clear: Scared of repudiating Trump\u2019s base, the House GOP is racing at top speed towards its extremist fringe to validate millions of Americans living in an alternative reality even if Cheney\u2019s survival suggests that privately many GOP members don\u2019t believe the election was stolen. A 9/11 truther, who touted anti-Semitic conspiracies and expressed support for assassinations of Democratic leaders, Greene is no longer the outlier in her party across America\u2019s vast heartland \u2013 Cheney is. House Republicans vote to keep Liz Cheney in leadership after she defends her impeachment vote Cheney, who, until the Trump insurrection, was a reliable vote for the President save on some foreign policy issues, made a powerful statement by winning in a 145 to 61 vote to keep her leadership post. Her victory was a sign that in private at least, there are some in the House Republican Party who are willing to stand up to extremism \u2013 even if many lack the courage to do so in public. Her triumph will encourage orthodox Washington conservatives \u2013 including many in the Senate who supported her, to think the fight for the future direction of the party is not hopeless. But Cheney still faces the very real prospect of a primary challenge in her fervently pro-Trump state of Wyoming. And while the lawmakers did not have to declare to their colleagues how they voted on Cheney\u2019s retention of the House Conference Chair job, it would not be surprising to see some of the most enthusiastic Trump supporters in the caucus publicly reveal their votes against her. \u201cThis is clearly a moment to define where the party is going and the party is choosing a Hell of a path here,\u201d Mary Katharine Ham, a prominent conservative writer and CNN political commentator, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper before Cheney\u2019s vote total was announced. Greene said in the meeting that her past social media posts did not represent who she was. But her sense of being impervious to the customs of her fast-shifting party shone through a defiant interview with the Washington Examiner that published as Wednesday\u2019s meeting went on. \u201cKevin McCarthy and all these leaders, the leadership, and everyone is proving that they are all talk and not about action, and they\u2019re just all about doing business as usual in Washington,\u201d Greene said. House Democrats move swiftly to strip Marjorie Taylor Greene of committee assignments In many ways, Wednesday\u2019s meeting accelerated the direction the party has been heading at least since many parts of its traditional base became disillusioned with the establishment following years of war and the 2008 financial crisis. Trump\u2019s weaponizing of the issue of race and swift social change after Barack Obama\u2019s presidency continued the conspiratorial trend while his seditious post-election behavior removed the last restraints to an all-out embrace of extremism. This will all have profound consequences for the country. There have always been wide, and proper, ideological differences between Democrats and Republicans. They are, if anything, widening. But this is not a new front in the perennial duel over health care or taxes. One of America\u2019s great parties, by elevating unhinged radicals such as Greene, and by threatening those like Cheney who accept the truth of Biden\u2019s win last year, is implicitly rejecting the sacred values of the American political system itself and its essential underpinning of objective truth and fact. Those who declared a final victory for democracy when Trump left town after his attempt to steal President Joe Biden\u2019s victory may have spoken too soon. Why Kevin McCarthy has already failed his first big leadership test Wednesday\u2019s turmoil also underscored how McCarthy has capitulated to the extreme forces within his caucus and in the country. A week after his pilgrimage to make up with Trump after his tepid criticism of his role inciting the Capitol insurrection, the leader refused to strip Greene of her committee posts. The spectacle of the leader being led around by a congresswoman who has been in Washington for four weeks either showed great political weakness or cynical calculation. He will leave it to House Democrats to rebuke Greene. While that makes McCarthy look feckless, it also suggests he concluded that it is better for him politically for Democrats to punish a Make America Great Again hero than for his caucus to alienate their base. Yet his failure to deal with the Greene issue himself means that many of his members \u2013 especially those from more vulnerable districts \u2013 now face a choice between voting in the full House to punish a Trump supporter or to open themselves to accusations they are endorsing her crazed rhetoric. McCarthy condemned Greene\u2019s social media activity in a statement and accused Democrats of not meeting him half way on finding a solution that would have reallocated Greene\u2019s committee posts. (Critics had complained she was placed on an education committee, following her claims that several school massacres were \u201cfalse flag operations.\u201d) But he also stated that he took Greene at her word that she now recognized that her conduct as a member of Congress needed to be of a higher standard than when she was a private citizen. \u201cThe voters decided that she can come and serve,\u201d McCarthy said after the meeting, adding that Greene had denounced her own social media activity. In her comments to the Examiner, in which she again alluded to lies that Trump won the election and insulted Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell, Greene showed she has no incentive to reform her behavior. \u201cNow, we have Joe Biden in the White House and Nancy Pelosi at 80 million years old as speaker, and we\u2019ve got a Senate that we don\u2019t control anymore, with, you know, Mr. Big Turtle in charge up there just, just losing gracefully, losing gracefully,\u201d Greene said in the interview. Why Mitch McConnell chose *this* moment to condemn Marjorie Taylor Greene Local activists and other outliers in Washington such as Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger might argue that all is not lost for the GOP and that the reckoning will take many months, as memories fade of the Trump presidency. But many of those state Republican officials who stood firm in the face of the ex-President\u2019s attempt to overturn election results are facing the similar kind of assaults and likely primary challenges as Cheney and the other nine House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. And Republican senators, such as McConnell, who called Greene a \u201ccancer,\u201d and others who condemned her remarks would insist that they are standing up for the institutional values of the party that saved the world for democracy by winning the Cold War against communism. Yet in the next few weeks, the vast majority of GOP senators are expected to vote to acquit Trump in his Senate impeachment trial. Most will take refuge in a questionable constitutional conceit that the trial is moot since Trump is an ex-President. This will spare them having to wrestle with the moral choice of what to do with a commander in chief who sent his supporters on a deadly march on another branch of government. Their motivation is the same as those who are appeasing Greene \u2013 a desire to avoid antagonizing the party base and to avoid primary challenges in order to retain their hold on power.",

            "article_content": "US President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have been friends, allies and partners in a relationship that has spanned nearly four decades. When they first met, Biden was a junior senator in his early 40s; Netanyahu was a fledgling diplomat nearly a decade younger. Now with their first phone call expected imminently, the two must decide how their relationship will evolve, at the height of their careers and the peak of their powers. But the last four years will complicate the next four with Biden\u2019s desire to eventually reenter the Iran nuclear deal and his choice of former top-level Obama officials who crafted and advocated for it, a likely early flash point. Netanyahu was a bottomless source of unwavering support for Donald Trump in office, not once publicly criticizing the unpredictable and often spiteful President. The 71-year-old celebrated nearly every foreign policy initiative of the Trump administration in the Middle East, becoming his most visible international cheerleader. With an upcoming election, a third national lockdown, and an imminent resumption of his trial on corruption charges, Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader must work with the man who ousted Trump from the Oval Office. Biden taps Iran envoy to face challenges of confronting both Tehran and polarized views at home Biden\u2019s relationship with Israel stretches back nearly a half-century to when he met then-Prime Minister Golda Meir in 1973 as a freshman senator from Delaware. Since then, it has grown into a \u201cvery emotional attachment to Israel,\u201d one former Obama administration official told CNN. \u201cHe sees Israel through that lens and as a genuine democracy in a region not characterized as that.\u201d Biden and Netanyahu first developed their friendship in the 1980s, when Biden was a young senator serving on the Foreign Relations Committee and Netanyahu was serving in the Israeli embassy in Washington, DC. Over the years, the two men got to know each other, met each other\u2019s families, and kept in contact as Netanyahu rose through politics to become Israel\u2019s prime minister in 1996. When Netanyahu lost his election to Ehud Barak three years later, \u201cBiden stayed in touch with him, wrote him an occasional note, things politicians wouldn\u2019t ordinarily do,\u201d said a source familiar with the relationship. \u201cI know Bibi appreciated it. Biden didn\u2019t treat him like a has-been.\u201d As the years went by, Netanyahu would stop by Biden\u2019s office to visit on his trips to Washington. But the friendship was tested once Biden became vice president to Barack Obama. Netanyahu infamously lectured Obama on Middle East politics in the White House in 2011, then featured it in his election campaign in 2019. Blinken to State Dept. staff: 'It's a new day for America; it's a new day for the world' When Biden visited Israel in 2010, Netanyahu\u2019s government announced new settlement building in East Jerusalem, which then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called \u201cinsulting.\u201d \u201cThe later years of the Obama administration were tough. Some of the team will remember that, but [Biden is] not going to have any interest in stoking the tensions,\u201d said one source familiar with the relationship. Netanyahu clashed with Obama over negotiations with the Palestinians, then again more openly over the Iran nuclear deal. Despite the friction, the personal relationship between Netanyahu and Biden persevered. In 2014, Biden said he once told Netanyahu, \u201cBibi, I don\u2019t agree with a damn thing you say, but I love you.\u201d Biden\u2019s friendship with the brash Israeli leader was seen as an asset during the Obama presidency, and Biden was thought of as the one who could smooth things out, according to sources familiar with the dynamics. But the dynamics have changed. Netanyahu long ago became a political chameleon, shifting from the Prime Minister who endorsed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in an important speech in 2009 to the leader who endorsed Trump\u2019s vision for Middle East peace a decade later, which discarded any conventional notion of two states for two peoples. He has led centrist, center-right, and right-wing governments in his 14 years in office but no period was as good for him \u2013 or as easy for him \u2013 as the Trump administration. Trump was Netanyahu\u2019s gift that kept on giving. Pentagon won't commit to Afghanistan troop withdrawal by May, says Taliban are not honoring commitments to US Before the first of three elections in a year in April 2019, Trump recognized Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights and declared Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization, a move for which Netanyahu claimed partial credit. Before the third straight election in March 2020, Trump unveiled his plan for Middle East peace, standing next to a beaming Netanyahu, who explained most of the details of the plan himself. In exchange, Netanyahu appeared to align Israel ever more closely with the Republican Party, even going so far as to name a new settlement in the Golan Heights after the former President, called Trump Heights. When Netanyahu joined Trump at the White House for the signing of the Abraham Accords alongside the Emirati and Bahraini Foreign Ministers, the Israeli leader did not meet with any Democratic politicians. Ron Dermer, Israeli Ambassador to the US and one of those closest to Netanyahu, was a frequent visitor to the White House. Dermer\u2019s term ended the day the Biden administration took office. Israeli Minister Tzachi Hanegbi insists Netanyahu\u2019s policies were never pro-Republican or pro-Democrat, but aligned only with Israel\u2019s needs. \u201cOur policy is always bipartisan,\u201d Hanegbi said, \u201cbut of course [Netanyahu] was always very satisfied with the policies from Trump.\u201d \u201cWhen we will have a great relationship with the Biden administration \u2013 and we will have a great relationship with the new administration \u2013 it doesn\u2019t mean we are pro-Democratic and anti-Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cThe chemistry, the intimacy, the mutual recognition of each other\u2019s passion for his country \u2013 these are things that can create credibility to each other\u2019s policies.\u201d But Netanyahu is now in the midst of a fourth election campaign in two years, with no guarantee that the country can break the cycle of endless elections. Netanyahu benefited politically from attacking Obama, showing the Israeli public that he had the fortitude to stand up to an American leader. Now he must decide whether to do so under Biden. \u201cNetanyahu is a supreme diplomat, but when it came to the US, he carries the burden of his almost explicit allegiance to the GOP,\u201d said Dani Dayan, Israel\u2019s former New York Consul-General and a candidate for the New Hope party, challenging Netanyahu\u2019s Likud in the March 23rd election. \u201cIsrael\u2019s next prime minister will have much to do to restore the bipartisan relationship.\u201d Netanyahu is under attack from Gideon Sa\u2019ar, an ideological right-wing politician who split from Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party to form the New Hope party.  Despite Sa\u2019ar\u2019s opposition to territorial concessions and a two-state solution, he has vowed to restore bipartisan support of Israel, positioning himself to be a better partner for Biden. Biden steps into global scene upended by Trump's ego-driven tumult \u201cI will rebuild Israel\u2019s good and balanced relationships with both sides,\u201d promised Sa\u2019ar in a Zoom meeting with AIPAC. \u201cAs Prime Minister, I will work with President Biden and his administration to stress the importance of not returning to the previous deal.\u201d Biden has a strong belief in foreign policy built, in part, on personal relationships, analysts told CNN, but his friendship with Netanyahu will likely be tested by political pressure in the months to come. The election is only one challenge, and it may not even be the first one with the potential to strain the relationship. The Biden administration\u2019s direction on a nuclear deal with Iran is at the top of the priority list for Israel. The original nuclear deal was the source of some of the most bitter disputes between Obama and Netanyahu, highlighted in the Prime Minister\u2019s decision to speak before a joint session of Congress in 2015, a speech which Obama did not attend. \u201cIsrael\u2019s relations with Obama were frosty, they got off to a bad start and never recovered,\u201d said David Makovsky, a director at the Washington Institute for Near East Studies. \u201cBut Biden is someone Israelis know. He\u2019s been around for a longtime.\u201d Biden inherits a raft of global crises (including some unknowns) Tony Blinken, Biden\u2019s newly confirmed Secretary of State, has said the administration would not roll back American recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or return the embassy from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. Yet Biden\u2019s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Biden viewed a two-state solution as the only path forward to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and Biden is expected to pursue at least a reduction in settlement expansion in the West Bank, especially following the surge of approvals under the Trump administration. Even so, Biden is not expected to put Israeli-Palestinian negotiations very high on his agenda, according to one former Obama official who worked on the region, who said the administration \u201cdoes not want to spend the political capital\u201d on the issue. \u201cWith Biden, there won\u2019t be this perception that he is out to get [Netanyahu],\u201d said veteran diplomat Dennis Ross, who served as a Middle East negotiator and adviser to three US administrations. \u201cThat\u2019s not what this relationship would be,\u201d Ross added. \u201cThere was a perception that grew up in Israel that Obama wasn\u2019t fair to Israel. Standing up to an American president who doesn\u2019t look fair is seen as a good thing in Israel. Standing up to an American president who is seen as fair isn\u2019t great. Biden is largely seen as being fair.\u201d CNN\u2019s Andrew Carey and Vivian Salama contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Two roads diverged in American politics, and the Republican Party chose the one traveled by disgraced ex-President Donald Trump and QAnon conspiracy theorists. While pundits ponder the GOP\u2019s future \u2013 and traditionalists hope to change course out of the wreckage left by Trump\u2019s insurrection \u2013 Washington\u2019s power players and state activists have already made their choice. Highlighting the former President\u2019s lightning fast rehabilitation, the House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will visit Trump in Florida on Thursday after repudiating his own criticism of the incitement of the US Capitol riot. Only a week after Trump left the White House, it\u2019s clear that his party is not ready to let him go. Extremists and Trumpists are on the rise, while lawmakers who condemned his aberrant conduct fight for their political careers. The anti-Trump wing \u2013 represented by members of Congress such as Sens. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Mitt Romney of Utah and Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger \u2013 look like a small and outmaneuvered force. This week\u2019s sorting will have significant implications for the GOP\u2019s positioning as it heads into the 2022 midterm elections, and for President Joe Biden\u2019s hopes of draining the poison from Washington in the name of national unity. But it will also pose a fundamental question for the Grand Old Party itself. Is yet another doubling down on grassroots fury and the Trump base the best way to win back Americans? Especially those in suburban areas who rejected the ex-President who lost the House, the Senate and the White House in a single four-year term? A jazzed turnout by the pro-Trump base is vital to GOP hopes of winning the House in the 2022 midterms. But there is also a chance that a flurry of fervently pro-Trump Senate candidates in swing states could damage the party\u2019s hopes of overturning the thin Democratic majority in the chamber. Most House Republicans silent over violent Marjorie Taylor Greene comments as Democrats condemn them Across the country, Republican leaders are reacting to Trump\u2019s exit by intensifying the political revolution that transformed the party in his image, censuring and marginalizing those deemed disloyal to a defeated and twice-impeached ex-President. In a key impeachment test vote this week, 45 GOP senators signaled that they plan for Trump to pay no price for inciting the most heinous assault by a president on the US government in history in the Capitol riot. McCarthy, who humiliatingly walked back his earlier tepid criticism of Trump, has traveled to Florida for an audience as he seeks to make amends to the former leader in his palace in exile. In another sign of the GOP\u2019s future course, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was not censured by her party after CNN\u2019s KFile reported that she expressed supporting in recent years assassinations of Democratic leaders before she ran for Congress. McCarthy plans to have a word with the congresswoman over what his spokesman in a statement Wednesday evening called the \u201cdeeply disturbing\u201d comments. Axios was first to report the statement and McCarthy\u2019s plans to speak with Greene. But the QAnon adherent\u2019s rocketing rise as a prominent face of a party in the thrall of lies and outlandish propaganda does not seem in danger. In fact, Greene, was rewarded with a plum committee assignment. Alarmed by splits in his party, McCarthy has ordered his troops to \u201ccut that crap out\u201d and focus on Democrats, CNN reported Wednesday. It is not clear whether his admonition applies to pro-Trump Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who is traveling to Wyoming to slam the GOP\u2019s No. 3 House leader Liz Cheney, who voted to impeach Trump, on her own turf. Remnants of the old GOP \u2013 such as former George W. Bush aide Rob Portman \u2013 who are unwilling to sign up to the unhinged populism that now drives the party of Lincoln have nowhere to go. The Ohio senator announced this week that he will not run for reelection. Kinzinger told CNN\u2019s David Axelrod in his \u201cAxe Files\u201d podcast that he voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol Hill uprising \u201cknowing full well it could very well be terminal to my career.\u201d But in Arkansas, former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is wearing her wars with the Washington media in her dishonest tenure as a badge of honor to appeal to the fervidly pro-Trump base in a gubernatorial run. And in Arizona, Oregon and Pennsylvania, anti-Trump Republicans such as Cindy McCain are being purged while Trump loyalists take prominent positions and state officials who stood firm against the former President\u2019s efforts to overturn Biden\u2019s election win come under extreme pressure. Retirements shake up 2022 map as Republican senators eye exits Former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is now a CNN commentator, said on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d that the GOP needed to move swiftly against Greene and compared the failure of leaders to honor its values with the courage shown by detained Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny. \u201cThey are worried about losing an election or not winning a majority,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThese folks have to stand up and say this is not our party, we disavow this and this is unacceptable to us.\u201d The lesson of the Trump era is that where there is a choice in the GOP between its values and power, Power always wins. But the party\u2019s descent into the sewer of election lies is coming with an increasing price for the rest of the nation. The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday issued a rare threat bulletin related to domestic terrorism Wednesday warning of the potential for violence by extremists emboldened by the US Capitol attack.   The warning cited the presidential transition \u201cas well as other perceived grievances fueled by false narratives\u201d as potential catalysts for uprisings. Those narratives were pushed for weeks by Trump and his Republican enablers in Washington and still find a home in sections of the conservative media. The GOP\u2019s embrace of the departed Trump is perfectly logical, even if it leaves Republican lawmakers in awkward positions as they let his crimes against the Constitution slide along with lies that the 2020 election was stolen from him. The former President has long enjoyed elevated approval ratings in his party that have protected him from the consequences of his unconstitutional power grabs and failures among Republicans leaders he bullied for years. Their discomfort when confronted by the Washington media pales by comparison to the fury of grassroots voters back home if they break with the ex-President. Still, a CNN/SSRS poll published just before he left office, found however that 48% of Republicans wanted to move on from Trump while 47% hoped that he would continue to be regarded as the leader of the party. The clarity offered this week \u2013 including McCarthy\u2019s pilgrimage to Mar-a-Lago \u2013 suggests that party leaders and rank-and-file members believe that any blip in Trump\u2019s popularity after the Capitol mob attack was only temporary. And McCarthy\u2019s strategy makes clear he views the Trump base as critical to seizing what history suggests is a strong chance of winning back the House for the GOP in the midterms of a new president\u2019s first term in 2022. He may also be making a judgment that corporate donors who halted PAC contributions to GOP lawmakers who refused to certify Biden\u2019s election win will return to the fold with the potential prospect of a Republican House majority from 2023. McCarthy to visit the former president in Florida, showing where he stands in a post-Trump Republican Party Power has always been a key motivating factor behind the Senate GOP\u2019s pained support for the ex-President and its unwillingness to constrain him or punish his transgressions when he was in office. Any senator who wants to avoid a primary challenge has no practical choice but to demonstrate total loyalty to Trump. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, whose presidential dreams were crushed by the former reality star in 2016, was long seen as the poster boy for a new, more optimistic and inclusive GOP. A career trajectory that now has him standing strongly with Trump and branding impeachment as all about \u201cvengeance from the radical left\u201d is an apt personification of the transformation Trump wrought in the party. It may also have something to do with chatter about a possible primary challenge from Ivanka Trump. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was among the most distraught Republicans over the attack on his beloved US Senate incited by Trump in his effort to thwart the constitutional transfer of power to Biden. The Kentucky senator even made it known that he was thinking of voting to convict Trump of high crimes and misdemeanors in his Senate trial. He has yet to say what he will decide. But on Tuesday, McConnell was among the senators who voted, unsuccessfully to dismiss the case on the dubious grounds that it is unconstitutional to try a former President who was impeached while in office. The vote reflected increasing confidence among Trump\u2019s Washington acolytes that he will escape a conviction that would preclude him from running for federal office in the future. Another key Republican figure, former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, who expertly engineered her exit from Trump\u2019s administration with the ex-President\u2019s blessing, has walked back her tame earlier criticism of Trump after the insurrection. Now, Haley who is clearly laying the ground for a run for president in 2024, is painting the President who tried to destroy American democracy as the victim. \u201cI mean, give the man a break,\u201d Haley said on Fox News.",

            "article_content": "A wide range of Senate Republicans are noncommittal about whether they are considering convicting Donald Trump of committing high crimes and misdemeanors at his upcoming impeachment trial, a sign that the soon-to-be former President\u2019s political future rests squarely with his fellow Republicans who are weighing whether to hold him accountable for the deadly riot in the Capitol this month. As the Senate reconvened Tuesday for the first time since the pro-Trump mob ransacked the Capitol on January 6, a number of top Republicans pointedly refused to say if they\u2019d consider convicting Trump for his role in inciting the crowd, trying to subvert the will of voters and lying for months about widespread fraud in the elections. Yet an outspoken faction of their colleagues warned their party not to take such a drastic step of forbidding Trump from ever holding office again, while other Republicans contended that convicting a former President would be unconstitutional, giving them a way to argue for acquittal while also criticizing Trump\u2019s conduct. In interviews, several Republicans claimed they were keeping an open mind \u2013 a sign that it remains far too early to know whether 17 Republicans would break ranks and join 50 Democrats to convict Trump of inciting an insurrection. How Republicans ultimately vote will come down to a mix of factors: The strength of the case brought by House Democrats, how the President\u2019s team mounts its defense and, perhaps most importantly, the mood of the country at the moment it comes time to cast the decisive votes. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people talk about a vote of conscience, and I think that\u2019s a good way to put it,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican and member of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s leadership team, told reporters on Tuesday. The GOP positioning is another indication that Republican senators\u2019 posture toward Trump\u2019s second impeachment is markedly different than last year\u2019s trial, when virtually all GOP senators steadfastly aligned themselves with the President after the House impeached him over charges of abusing power and obstructing Congress. This time, though, many GOP senators are disgusted at Trump\u2019s conduct as he cast doubt about the election results and fed lies to his supporters that Biden didn\u2019t actually win, ultimately leading to the pro-Trump mob that overran the Capitol as Congress was certifying Biden\u2019s electoral victory. There\u2019s wide expectation that the vote to convict will almost certainly be a bipartisan one and could very likely gain more than the support of just Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, the lone Republican who voted to convict Trump on the abuse of power charge in 2020, but who says he\u2019s undecided now. Still, getting to 17 Republican defectors remains an open question. Inside the fight for the Capitol: US Capitol Police officers recount being unprepared and 'betrayed' South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the GOP whip who was critical of the doomed efforts by Trump allies to overturn the election in Congress, has been viewed as a potential swing vote. On Tuesday, Thune, who is up for reelection next year and is close to McConnell, punted when asked if the President committed impeachable offenses. \u201cIt sounds like we\u2019re going to have a trial to examine that, and like all senators, I\u2019ll fulfill my constitutional duty and listen intently to the evidence, and we will come to the conclusion,\u201d Thune said. Others took similar positions. Sen. Todd Young, an Indiana Republican up for reelection next year, told CNN that he would \u201cdo his duty\u201d  but refused to cast judgment on Trump\u2019s actions. \u201cI\u2019m focused on the very near term, which is a peaceful transition of power,\u201d Young said. \u201cI just spent a week traveling around the state of Indiana. That\u2019s really what\u2019s on people\u2019s minds. They were rattled, to put it mildly, by the events of January 6, and I\u2019ve done my best to be part of the near-term healing and rebuilding of trust, and in trying to help people process that.\u201d McConnell, who has privately indicated he thinks Trump committed impeachable offenses but said he would listen to the arguments in the impeachment trial before settling on a decision, set the tone on Tuesday when he pointedly blamed Trump for playing a key role in inciting the mob. \u201cThe mob was fed lies,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cThey were provoked by the President and other powerful people. And they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like. But we pressed on.\u201d The Senate\u2019s second impeachment trial for Trump, which could begin within days, will force Republicans to go on the record one more time about how they view the outgoing President. If 67 senators convict Trump, they then could vote to bar him from running for office again by a simple majority of senators. GOP senators close to Trump are warning that such as vote could backfire on the GOP, where Trump still holds significant sway among the base. \u201cIt will destroy the party,\u201d Graham predicted when asked about a successful vote to convict Trump. \u201cThe Republican Party wants to move forward.\u201d Congressional aides and senators have spent the past several days digging into the question about whether the impeachment trial is constitutional, with many concluding that there are arguments to make the case on either side. A number of other Republicans are making a constitutional case against the trial itself. That argument \u2013 that the proceedings are unconstitutional \u2013 could give GOP senators a way to argue that the President\u2019s conduct was improper without casting a politically tough vote to convict him. \u201cWhy are we doing this when the President is out of office?\u201d asked Iowa GOP Sen. Joni Ernst, who said Tuesday she didn\u2019t think it was constitutional. \u201cI have read arguments on both sides, but he is not our President after tomorrow.\u201d Raskin: I am not going to lose my son in 2020 and country in 2021 The House Democratic impeachment managers \u2013 and many other constitutional scholars \u2013 argue that it\u2019s constitutional to move forward with an impeachment trial of a former President. While it would be unprecedented for the Senate to convict an ex-president, they point to precedent where the Senate has asserted it has the constitutional right to try former federal officers. \u201cWe need to set a precedent that the severest offense ever committed by a President will be met by the severest remedy provided by the Constitution,\u201d Schumer said Tuesday. \u201cImpeachment and conviction by this chamber as well as disbarment from future office.\u201d For members up for reelection in 2022, the question of convicting Trump becomes even harder. Many members are running in states that Trump won. And some of those members have made it clear that they will weigh conviction with the question of what is best for uniting the country. \u201cMy answer to anything that doesn\u2019t relate to the inauguration is I\u2019ll talk to you after the inauguration,\u201d said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a Republican who is playing a central role in preparing for the Wednesday event but who also faces voters next year. And some of Trump\u2019s Hill allies wouldn\u2019t lay out their thinking on Tuesday. \u201cI got to wait \u2018til I hear the evidence,\u201d Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the most senior Senate Republican, said Tuesday when asked if he thinks Trump committed impeachable offenses. The Senate gets to call the shots for Trump's impeachment trial The timing of the Senate trial remains in flux, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has yet to send the article of impeachment to the Senate. The impending trial gives Republicans some control over delaying Biden\u2019s agenda, if they choose to. While Democrats will control the Senate after Wednesday, Republicans can slow down the Senate so that it cannot conduct an impeachment trial and confirm Biden\u2019s nominees at the same time. On Tuesday, Cornyn told reporters that he did not believe Republicans would be agreeing to divide the days in half so that the Senate could approve Biden\u2019s Cabinet nominees in the morning and then move to an impeachment trial each afternoon. Doing so would require 100 senators to agree, which, Cornyn said, \u201cis not going to be possible.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Nancy Pelosi\u2019s choice because once she sends the article of impeachment over, it displaces all other business,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cIf she wants to delay the confirmation of President Biden\u2019s nominees to Cabinet positions and prevent President Biden from asking for and receiving additional Covid-19 relief, that would be one way to do it, so they have a big decision to make.\u201d With so much uncertainty ahead, even some Republicans viewed as likely to convict have refused to show their hands. \u201cI\u2019m going to wait and see the evidence as it\u2019s presented,\u201d Romney told CNN.

            "article_content": "Federal authorities are piecing together a chilling picture of the January 6 insurrection that reveals major security and intelligence failures, underscores profound fissures in American society and hints at the political challenges ahead for President-elect Joe Biden, even as they race to ensure the safety of US leaders and next week\u2019s inauguration. Emerging details paint an even grimmer picture than the shocking images of violence broadcast live around the world last week. Evidence suggests planning by the insurrectionists, and there are concerns that they may have received support from some Capitol Police, current and former members of the military, and even some members of Congress. As rioters broke into the Capitol building and some chanted \u201chang Mike Pence,\u201d the seditious mob ripped through the \u201cthin blue line\u201d many claim to revere, kicking and beating police with their own batons, spraying them with chemical irritants, threatening to kill them. One policeman and four others died that day. Once inside the building, The Washington Post reports the insurrectionists came within minutes of reaching the vice president, who was whisked to safety with his wife and daughter. Some had driven to the Capitol days earlier, others had filled their vehicles with guns, ammunition, crossbows, machetes and, in one case, a note listing a congressman by name. Days after the attack, even as security reinforcements arrive, some lawmakers tell CNN they now fear for their safety. While some Republicans argued President Donald Trump\u2019s unprecedented second impeachment will only inflame divisions, federal officials warned that extremists, after seeing the results of last week\u2019s attack on the US Capitol, are now likely more emboldened to carry out attacks on the January 20 inauguration and throughout 2021. An internal FBI bulletin disseminated to law enforcement this week warned that \u201carmed protests\u201d are being planned at all 50 state capitols and in Washington in the days leading up to Biden\u2019s swearing in. Federal law enforcement agencies issued urgent bulletins calling for assistance securing the nation\u2019s capital, which now bristles with road blocks and steel barriers to wall off the \u201cPeople\u2019s House\u201d and will host as many as 25,000 National Guard \u2013 a stronger military footprint than the US has in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria combined. By Friday, the FBI had received 140,000 digital tips regarding the attack, including photos and video, federal officials had opened 275 criminal investigations, charged roughly 98 individuals, and taken 100 individuals into custody. As senior administration leaders who would normally take the lead remained silent for days \u2013 including the heads of the Justice Department, the Department of Homeland Security and the President himself \u2013 federal officials launched the most extensive counterterrorism probe since September 11, 2001, and continued planning to fortify Washington. \u201cOur posture is aggressive. It\u2019s going to stay that way through the inauguration,\u201d FBI Director Christopher Wray said at a Thursday briefing on inauguration security. He added that the agency was monitoring \u201cextensive\u201d online chatter about further potential armed protests and issued a warning to the men and woman who wreaked havoc on the Capitol. \u201cWe know who you are, if you\u2019re out there,\u201d Wray said, \u201cand FBI agents are coming to find you.\u201d The domestic terrorists struck at a time when the US government is confronting the worst known cyberattack by a foreign adversary in its history, with Russia suspected of penetrating hundreds of businesses and numerous federal agencies. Their bloodshed and destruction come as Covid-19 claims record daily death tolls and a jobs crisis is brewing, with nearly 1 million people filing for unemployment benefits for the first time last week. The insurrection, fueled by Trump\u2019s lies about his definitive election loss, exposed the reach of baseless conspiracy theories that have radicalized Americans to the point that they laid siege to their own Capitol. The events of that day raise questions about intelligence failures, the military\u2019s lethargic response as panicked lawmakers pleaded by telephone for help, and law enforcement\u2019s potential blind spots or willful ignorance about the dangers posed by white supremacists and right-wing nativists. Those groups formed a combustible mix with the anti-Semites and QAnon conspiracists rampaging on January 6 to create an existential crisis for the Republican Party, which faces the choice of remaining in thrall to Trump and his more toxic supporters or breaking away. It creates a challenge for the larger country as well, according to CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein, who said the trajectory of Trump\u2019s \u201cwhite nationalist extremism has been very clear\u201d for the last four years, as are the potential costs to US security if it is left unchecked. \u201cPresident Trump has provided an enormous amount of oxygen to this very dangerous ideology,\u201d Brownstein told Jake Tapper on Thursday. \u201cAnd unless everyone involved, the Justice Department, law enforcement, Congress, is very serious about imposing consequences and taking the threat seriously, this could become a steady drumbeat through the Biden presidency.\u201d \u201cThe question is, can we more broadly send a signal that says we are not going to tolerate and look the other way as this metastasizes,\u201d Brownstein said. Already, thousands of armed pro-Trump extremists are plotting to surround the US Capitol ahead of Biden\u2019s inauguration, according to a lawmaker briefed by security officials Monday. A joint US government intelligence bulletin said the January 6 attack, meant to disrupt the certification of Biden\u2019s victory, may have given extremists of differing ideological stripes a way to connect. The bulletin warned that the insurrection \u201cis very likely part of an ongoing trend in which (extremists) exploit lawful protests, rallies, and demonstrations, and other gatherings to carry out ideologically motivated violence and criminal activity.\u201d Multiple defense officials have told CNN that the National Guard and law enforcement expect explosives like pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails to be used in any coming unrest. They are assuming perpetrators will come with high \u201caggression,\u201d said one senior defense official, who added, \u201ctheir intentions are very serious.\u201d Pipe bombs that could have done serious damage were planted outside the Republican and Democratic party headquarters in Washington last week but didn\u2019t go off. The expertise behind the bombs and the ease with which the raucous crowd seemed to mill about the Capitol complex with little resistance raised concerns participants had insider help and military expertise. At least two US Capitol Police officers were suspended and at least 10 more are under investigation for allegedly playing some sort of role, CNN reported. Michael Sherwin, the acting US attorney in Washington, DC, confirmed Friday that \u201cwe\u2019re seeing indications that law enforcement officers, both former and current, maybe who have been off duty, participating in this riot activity.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t care what your profession is, who you are, who you are affiliated with, if you are conducting or engaged in criminal activity, we will charge you and you will be arrested,\u201d Sherwin said. Part of that hunt is for \u201cseveral\u201d people possibly involved in the killing of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, according to two law enforcement officials. On Friday, Steven D\u2019Antuono of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office said his investigators are \u201cmaking progress\u201d on the investigation and are looking at \u201canyone and everyone\u201d who may be involved. He did not give specifics on the scope of the investigation. In the days after the attack, court records and news reports also confirmed that current and former US military members participated in the insurrection. The news triggered unprecedented statements from the leaders of major security agencies who felt the need to remind their men and women their loyalty is to the Constitution. On Tuesday, the America\u2019s most senior military leaders condemned the violent invasion and reminded service members of their obligation to support and defend the Constitution and reject extremism. The Defense Department has observed an increase in white supremacist ideology amongst active-duty service members and veterans, a senior defense official told CNN. The next day, US Secret Service Director James Murray sent agency employees a message urging them to remember their mission and remain professional during the upcoming inauguration. \u201cWe are expected to behave in a non-partisan manner,\u201d his memo said. Video images of a Capitol Police officer wearing a MAGA hat during the invasion and of another taking selfies with rioters left lawmakers deeply shaken. According to the Wall Street Journal, the officer seen wearing the trademark red cap put it on as part of a ruse to rescue more than a dozen trapped police officers during the riot. The officer has been suspended and an investigation is underway. \u201cThere were those acts of heroism, but next to that, there were also attacks of betrayal,\u201d Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez of New York said Tuesday on Instagram Live. \u201cAnd to run in the nation\u2019s Capitol and not know if an officer is there to help you or to harm you is also quite traumatizing.\u201d \u201cI did not know if I was going to make it to the end of that day alive,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said. \u201cIt is not an exaggeration to say that many, many members of the House were nearly assassinated.\u201d Some members are asking for bulletproof vests, considering getting their own security and taking other steps, such as changing their routes to work, lawmakers told CNN. Meanwhile, some Republicans expressed outrage at metal detectors installed at the entrance to the House chamber. Many House lawmakers are considering another appalling possibility: that the mob got assistance from some of their colleagues. Thirty-one members of Congress sent a letter to the acting House Sergeant at Arms, acting Senate Sergeant at Arms, and the acting chief of the US Capitol Police asking them to investigate \u201cunusual\u201d and \u201cconcerning\u201d tours they saw and reported to the Sergeant at Arms on January 5. \u201cMany of the Members who signed this letter, including those of us who have served in the military and are trained to recognize suspicious activity, as well as various members of our staff, witnessed an extremely high number of outside groups in the complex on Tuesday, January 5,\u201d the letter states. The groups of six to eight, who wore MAGA apparel, according to Democratic Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania, \u201ccould only have gained access to the Capitol Complex from a Member of Congress or a member of their staff,\u201d the letter said. \u201cI kind of assumed it must be a new member who didn\u2019t know the rules or something,\u201d Scanlon of Pennsylvania, one of the co-signers, told CNN. \u201cThere were people who were roaming around in the halls, apparently under the guidance of congressional staff\u201d at a time when tours have been canceled due to Covid. At least one right-wing conspiracist said he coordinated the rally where Trump spoke before the riot with three House Republicans: Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs of Arizona, and Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama, who spoke before the President took the stage and urged the crowd to \u201cstart taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d Brooks, Gosar and several other House GOP lawmakers are facing criticism for their incendiary language in the hours, days and weeks before the siege. Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, who is affiliated with the QAnon movement and regularly spreads right-wing conspiracy theories, has also come under scrutiny for tweeting about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s whereabouts as the attack was unfolding. On Friday, Pelosi announced retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honor\u00e9, a former vice director with the Joint Chiefs of staff, would lead a review of the Capitol\u2019s security. She added that, \u201cif, in fact, it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecution for that.\u201d Later that day, when asked if they are investigating allegations that Capitol Police and lawmakers were involved in the riot, D\u2019Antuono of the FBI\u2019s Washington Field Office said they will \u201cleave no stone unturned\u201d and are \u201clooking at every piece of the puzzle.\u201d Sherwin, the acting US attorney for Washington, DC, told reporters earlier in the week that \u201cwe\u2019re looking at significant felony cases tied to sedition and conspiracy.\u201d Evidence uncovered so far, including weapons and tactics seen on surveillance video, suggests a level of planning, a federal law enforcement official said. And court filings are offering shocking new details. One memo in a filing Friday seeks to extend the detention of Jacob Anthony Chansley, the face-painted QAnon believer who rallied people inside the Capitol wearing a horned headdress and carrying a six-foot spear and a bullhorn. Prosecutors describe those who took over the Capitol as \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d and offer new details about Chansley\u2019s role in the violent siege last week, including that Chansley left a note on the dais where Vice President Pence had stood that morning saying, \u201cIt\u2019s only a matter of time, justice is coming.\u201d Chansley later told the FBI he did not mean the note as a threat but said the vice president was a \u201cchild-trafficking traitor.\u201d Before he was arrested, Chansley also told the FBI he wanted to return to Washington for the inauguration to protest. In a separate case, prosecutors in Texas alleged that a retired Air Force reservist who carried plastic zip tie-like restraints on the Senate floor may have intended to restrain lawmakers. It was one of the many chilling details to emerge as investigators tracked down some of the most recognizable faces from the riot. Authorities apprehended the man in widely circulated photos carrying a Confederate flag inside Capitol Hill, another who had worn a \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d sweatshirt and the Olympic gold medalist swimmer Klete Keller. Federal officials also charged Peter Stager, a burly bearded man, with beating a DC police officer with a flagpole that had an American flag on it. \u201cEverybody in there is a treasonous traitor,\u201d Stager said in a video obtained by the FBI. \u201cDeath is the only remedy for what\u2019s in that building.\u201d A few arrests suggest the apparent murderous intent of some in the crowd. One man from Alabama faces 17 criminal counts, largely for possession of multiple weapons, including a shotgun, a rifle, three pistols and 11 Molotov cocktails, as well as ammunition and shotgun shells without registration, according to an indictment. After living in his truck in DC for about a week, the man parked it about a block from the Capitol on January 6, according to court documents. Police started searching the truck after spotting a firearm handle and found the weapons, as well as a stun gun, several machetes, a crossbow; several large-capacity ammunition-feeding devices; and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, according to a memorandum that prosecutors filed January 12 in support of his detention. Also in the truck: the handwritten note with Indiana Rep. Andre Carson\u2019s name and an added observation that he is \u201cone of two Muslims in House of Reps.\u201d The second man is alleged to have driven from Colorado to Washington, DC, a day before Trump\u2019s rally with more than 2,500 rounds of ammunition and an assault rifle. He is said to have texted acquaintances that he wanted to shoot or run over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and shoot DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, according to court records. \u201cIf I had a more concerning threats case come before me, I don\u2019t remember it,\u201d Magistrate Judge Michael Harvey of the DC District Court said Thursday. Some lawmakers\u2019 experiences made them worry that the rioters had a level of careful preparation that belies the narrative of a protest that wheeled out of control. Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a Massachusetts Democrat, told CNN that someone removed panic buttons installed throughout her office that had been regularly tested and maintained. An investigation is underway, said Pressley, who said the discovery was \u201ccertainly unnerving.\u201d Carson, whose name was on the note found in the car filled with weaponry and ammunition, is among a growing list of lawmakers critical of law enforcement\u2019s handling of the insurgency. \u201cIt is extremely disturbing to learn from press reports that I was one of several individuals identified in a list of \u2018good guys\u2019 and \u2018bad guys\u2019 targeted for attacks,\u201d Carson said in a statement provided to CNN. \u201cAs a former law enforcement officer, it is especially disappointing to see the failure of law enforcement officials, including the U.S. Capitol Police, to notify individuals like myself that we were targeted and at risk from the indicted terrorist and his co-conspirators.\u201d Investigators will be asking how federal authorities missed so many red flags, why they were so underprepared and slow to react. The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security failed to issue threat assessments about the potential of violence at the US Capitol ahead of last week\u2019s deadly attack, according to a source familiar with the matter and a senior DHS official. Typically, the FBI and DHS will produce a joint threat assessment for high-profile events and send it to law enforcement officials and relevant stakeholders. But no such report was compiled by either agency for the January 6 certification of Biden\u2019s victory, a controversial event for the President\u2019s followers. The Washington Post reported Friday that three days before the attack, an internal Capitol Police intelligence report warned that angry Trump supporters could attack \u201cCongress itself.\u201d The 12-page report describes a scenario eerily like the one that unfolded, with the President\u2019s enraged backers trying to stop Biden\u2019s certification and overturn the election results. A day before the chaos erupted, an FBI outpost in Virginia issued an internal warning that extremists were coming to Washington prepared to commit violence. The Post also reported that dozens of people on a terrorist watch list came to Washington for the January 6 events. The majority of them were suspected white supremacists with track records so disturbing they were put on the national Terrorist Screening Database as potential security risks. Four federal agencies announced Friday they are opening investigations into their own roles on January 6. The Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Justice and the Interior Department will all examine their preparations for the events in Washington that day that may have played a part in allowing rioters to breach the Capitol. These agencies and others are now preparing for rioters to descend on the Capitol again. The Secret Service is taking the lead on Biden\u2019s inauguration security planning. The National Mall will be closed to the general public on Inauguration Day, according to an official familiar with discussions. There will be no big screens, no toilets and the public will not be able to get down to the Mall where traditionally thousands gather to watch the new president be sworn in, the official said. The President-elect and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are still expected to take their oaths of office on the West Front of the US Capitol during a significantly scaled-down event. Biden said this week that his team had been receiving briefings in the wake of the violence and that he was \u201cnot afraid of taking the oath outside.\u201d CNN\u2019s Katelyn Polantz, Christina Carrega, David Shortell, Marshall Cohen, Nicky Robertson, Ellie Kaufman, Geneva Sands, Zachary Cohen, Oren Liebermann, Barbara Starr, Jamie Crawford, Jamie Gangel, Jake Tapper, Alex Marquardt, Jeff Zeleny, Kate Sullivan, Ryan Nobles, Annie Grayer, and Brian Todd contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, the new chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, defended President Donald Trump on Wednesday when asked if his ally bore any responsibility for inciting a riot at the US Capitol, putting the onus of last week\u2019s death and destruction instead on the mob. \u201cHe\u2019s not the one who made the decision to breach this Capitol,\u201d Scott said. Scott\u2019s comments came as the pro-Trump riot has torn apart the Republican Party, setting off a backlash among some donors, a historic second impeachment of the President and a fight over how best to build a path back to power. After losing the House, Senate and White House in four years, Trump remains broadly popular within the GOP. But the riot has led a small group of House Republicans \u2013 including Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 in GOP leadership in the chamber \u2013 to support his impeachment. Republican senators are now seriously considering whether to convict him of the charge, \u201cincitement of insurrection,\u201d after five people died in the attack. The Florida Republican told CNN that he wished Trump \u201cresponded faster\u201d to quell the violence, calling the riot \u201cunacceptable\u201d and \u201cun-American\u201d and for some of the insurrectionists to be prosecuted. But he did not hold Trump accountable for the attack, even though the President urged his supporters in a speech before the riot on January 6 to march to the Capitol, to \u201cfight like hell\u201d to save the country, and to \u201cstop the steal.\u201d Trump said then that he would \u201cnever give up\u201d and \u201cnever concede.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s irresponsible and false to say the President told people to break into the Capitol,\u201d Scott said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do that.\u201d The party\u2019s divide extends to the money machine that keeps it in office. The US Chamber of Commerce, corporate political action committees and major conservative donors are reevaluating whether they will donate to the 147 Republican members of Congress who objected to certifying the presidential election on the day of the attack in a deluded bid to overturn the results. Those members include Scott and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, who cited voter integrity concerns. The business community has recoiled in horror at the violence, potentially impairing Republicans\u2019 fundraising effort to flip both the House and Senate in 2022. The donor revolt is \u201cgoing to make every Republican\u2019s job that much harder,\u201d said Ken Spain, a GOP strategist. Spain said the corporate pushback now under way illustrates a fissure between corporate America and rank-and-file Republicans on issues such as free trade that has only grown wider in recent years. \u201cThe party was already becoming a more populist working-class party and Trump accelerated that,\u201d he said. \u201cRepublicans are at a fork in the road, and the direction that they choose to take in the coming days and weeks is going to have a profound impact on the future of the party.\u201d Scott, a former governor who voted last week against certifying Biden\u2019s win, downplayed the donors\u2019 outcry, saying that he conducted fundraising meetings between Thursday and Monday and \u201ceverybody\u2019s excited to help.\u201d \u201cCorporations, individuals, they have a choice,\u201d the senator said. \u201cIf you believe in a big government, less freedoms, socialism, you ought to actually put all your money into supporting the Democrats. If you want opportunity, and lower taxes and less government, you\u2019re going to support Republicans.\u201d Some major American companies, including Amazon and CNN\u2019s owner AT&T, have announced they will withhold PAC donations to those who objected to certifying the election results. Many other firms, ranging from Coca-Cola to UPS, have suspended political donations across the board. Business PACs are significant players in politics, accounting for more than $360 million in federal contributions during the 2020 cycle \u2013 with about 57% of the money flowing to GOP candidates, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Americans for Prosperity, the political arm of the influential network affiliated with Kansas industrialist Charles Koch, has warned it could withdraw financial support for lawmakers over their actions in the runup to the January 6 siege, although even before last week\u2019s insurrection, Koch officials had signaled they wanted to move away from strictly partisan politics. \u201cLawmakers\u2019 actions leading up to and during last week\u2019s insurrection will weigh heavy in our evaluation of future support,\u201d said AFP CEO Emily Seidel in a statement. The US Chamber of Commerce also warned that some lawmakers could lose financial support over their efforts to thwart the transfer of power but declined to single them out. \u201cWe will take into account the totality of what candidates and elected officials do, including the actions of last week, and importantly, the actions in the days ahead in determining whether or not we support them,\u201d said Neil Bradley, the chamber executive vice president, on Tuesday. \u201cI actually want to be very clear: There are some members, who by their actions, will have forfeited the support of the US Chamber of Commerce.\u201d But when pressed on what Missouri GOP Sen. Josh Hawley, who led the objection to the certification of the election in the Senate, would have to do to earn additional donations from the Chamber, Bradley said they would evaluate how members conducted themselves last week and in the days to come. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to say, nor would our members say today, that you have to do X, Y and Z and not do A, B and C,\u201d he said. Some major conservative donors have also focused their ire on the individual Republicans they view as having helped to instigate last week\u2019s events, particularly Hawley. Missouri businessman Sam Fox, who donated $300,000 to a super PAC that aided Hawley\u2019s election in 2018, said in a statement that the senator \u201ccan certainly forget about any support from me again\u201d after last week\u2019s events. \u201cSen. Hawley engaged in act of reckless pandering,\u201d said Fox, who served as US ambassador to Belgium under President George W. Bush. \u201cHe helped put the country on a path that has ended in five deaths and in disgrace for himself and for the nation.\u201d Hawley aides did immediately respond to a request for comment. The senator wrote an op-ed for the Southeast Missourian newspaper explaining why he continued to object after the violence in the Capitol. \u201cThe reason is simple: I will not bow to a lawless mob, or allow criminals to drown out the legitimate concerns of my constituents,\u201d Hawley wrote. Some top donors have remained silent in the aftermath of the riot. A spokeswoman for Ken Griffin, a billionaire hedge-fund manager and one of the GOP\u2019s biggest donors, declined to comment on whether he would review his donation policy. But others said they would stand by the Republicans in Congress. Dan Eberhart, an Arizona-based energy executive considering a bid against Democrat Sen. Mark Kelly in 2022, said, \u201cI have been a big donor to Rick Scott in the past and plan to continue to be.\u201d Eberhart said disaffected donors will \u201cmake up with Republicans pretty quickly\u201d if the Democrats, who will soon control the White House and both chambers in Congress, \u201coverreach\u201d in their agenda. \u201cDonors will want the counterweight that Republican provide. More money may go to the leadership PACs, but it will still go to Republicans if those are the policies donors support,\u201d he added. After House Republicans picked up seats in 2020 and with the Senate split 50-50 \u2013 and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris set to be the tiebreaker \u2013 eyes will turn to next year\u2019s midterms. The party out of power typically does well in midterms, and in 2022, Senate Republicans will have more seats to defend than the Democrats, including in battleground states like Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Democratic senators could have tough races in Arizona, New Hampshire, Nevada and elsewhere. Scott told CNN that he has three goals: presenting a \u201cclear choice\u201d to the country on how a Republican and Democratic Senate differ, raising more money and recruiting quality candidates. He said he hoped Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson would run for reelection, and that the GOP has \u201ca lot of opportunities to pick up additional seats.\u201d But Trump and his legacy will continue to shape the perceptions of the party in the next election. Already, Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, announced on Wednesday that the party is going up with a six-figure ad buy that blames Johnson for inciting the riot at the Capitol. The Florida senator said it\u2019s up to Trump and the Senate GOP candidates whether the then-former president hits the campaign trail on their behalf in 2022. When asked if he blamed Trump for losing the Senate, Scott said, \u201cMy focus is on \u2018how do we go forward?\u2019 \u201c CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Rioters were still ransacking the halls of the US Capitol when two Democrats stuck in lockdown together in the House office buildings across the street started drafting the impeachment resolution that led to the unprecedented second impeachment of President Donald Trump almost exactly one week later. California Rep. Ted Lieu was forced to evacuate his office in the Cannon Office Building as insurrectionists converged on the Capitol. Grabbing a ProBar energy bar in his office, Lieu said he and his chief of staff called the top aide to Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline while wandering the halls and asked if they could hunker down in Cicilline\u2019s office in the Rayburn House Office Building. Cicilline quickly agreed, and it was there that the two Democrats began watching the events unfold in the Capitol as their colleagues were forced to flee the House chamber with a mob outside. Lieu and Cicilline\u2019s aides, meanwhile, were texting with a top aide for Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, who was in hiding with Raskin\u2019s family as the siege unfolded. As Trump failed to call off the mob with his tweets, the Democrats vowed to try to remove the President from power for a second time. Key arrests from the Capitol riot so far Lieu quickly sent a message to a chain including the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee. \u201cFirst it said, \u2018I pray everyone is safe.\u2019 And second, I said, \u2018The House Judiciary Committee should start drafting articles of impeachment now, regardless of what leadership says,\u2019\u201d Lieu said in an interview. Several lawmakers, locked down elsewhere in the Capitol, quickly texted their agreement, and Lieu and Cicilline got to work with input from Raskin drafting the text that would serve as the basis of the House\u2019s 232-197 vote Wednesday to impeach Trump for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d Ten Republicans joined with the Democrats to support Trump\u2019s impeachment, in a stark break from the first impeachment of Trump in 2019. The co-authors, Cicilline, Lieu and Raskin, are three of the nine House impeachment managers who will argue their case against Trump in the upcoming Senate trial. Democratic lawmakers and aides told CNN that Trump\u2019s impeachment was the only feasible option to channel the fury and terror that lawmakers felt after their lives were placed in danger by a pro-Trump mob. As the hours and days progressed, the new information that was revealed \u2013 the rioters\u2019 desire to kill Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the violent attacks on Capitol Police leading to the death of an officer and the sinister aims of taking hostages \u2013 only strengthened their resolve to make Trump the first president in United States history to be impeached twice. \u201cThis is right in your face, easier for everyone to understand, including members of his own party, who also had to hide behind barricades and be evacuated,\u201d said Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, a Pennsylvania Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. Pelosi spent much of 2019 at odds with the wing of House Democrats pushing for impeachment, before Trump\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political opponent \u2013 and now President-elect \u2013 Joe Biden pushed Pelosi and nearly the entire Democratic caucus toward impeachment. But Pelosi had little hesitation the second time around, after her office was ransacked and her staff at risk when rioters broke into her ornate office just off the Capitol rotunda. Pelosi was still deliberate in her actions ahead of the impeachment vote, saying she wanted Pence to use the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from power. But she made clear the day after the riots the House would act if Pence did not. And there was no dissent in her ranks. \u201cMy phone is exploding with \u2018impeach, impeach, impeach,\u201d Pelosi said of her members. \u201cThe President must be held accountable.\u201d It was a unified front that never wavered. In fact, several members said, the steadfast desire to move forward only hardened in the days that followed in the wake of briefings from law enforcement officials that underscored just how catastrophic the events of January 6 \u2013 already deadly \u2013 could have been. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can make this any more clear,\u201d said one Democratic member who participated in several detailed briefings that outlined the possibility of a concerted and coordinated attack with a motive driven by bloodshed. \u201cIt was far worse than any of us imagined, far more dangerous than any of us could\u2019ve fathomed and positively terrifying in hindsight.\u201d For House Republicans, who were united against Trump\u2019s first impeachment, this round exposed not only the deep divisions over Trump\u2019s conduct but a real schism over how and if the party should move ahead without him. Rep. Liz Cheney, the No. 3 Republican, voted to impeach Trump, charging there had \u201cnever been a greater betrayal by a President of the United States of his office and his oath to the Constitution.\u201d Nine Republicans joined her to vote to impeach Trump, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is leaving open the possibility he could support conviction. It was a small minority of the conference, but it represented the most impeachment votes a president received from within his own party in US history. Those that chose to vote yes \u2013 a mix of mostly moderates and new members \u2013 made clear that they viewed Trump\u2019s actions as leaving with them with no choice, even as they grappled with the repercussions. How Liz Cheney became the conscience of Republicans \u201cI have backed this President through thick and thin for four years,\u201d South Carolina GOP Rep. Tom Rice said in a statement after his vote to impeach \u2013 one that stunned many of his colleagues. \u201cI campaigned for him and voted for him twice. But, this utter failure is inexcusable.\u201d Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, a second-term Ohio Republican, said in a statement his process mirrored that of members across the Capitol \u2013 one that included days of walking through memories of the events, participating in harrowing law enforcement briefings and watching videos that underscored the real severity of the moment, something many acknowledge they had no grasp of as they were rushed to undisclosed locations or their offices to shelter during the attack. What his vote came down to, however, was Trump\u2019s specific actions. \u201cThese are fundamental threats not just to people\u2019s lives but to the very foundation of our Republic,\u201d he said. Those positions set the stage for the next step, and the next chamber, where Republicans have largely kept their views on impeachment close to the vest. But one has, at least somewhat, tipped his hand: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In a message to his members just hours before the House vote, McConnell pledged he had yet to make up his mind and would listen to all the evidence presented. The Kentucky Republican, Trump\u2019s most ardent defender in the Senate in the first impeachment trial, has told associates he believes Trump committed impeachable offenses. He was also furious in the wake of not just the attack, but Trump and fellow Republicans\u2019 efforts to undercut Biden\u2019s electoral victory on the Senate floor. McConnell rebuffs Democrats' call for speedy impeachment trial, but is undecided on convicting Trump But McConnell, in a statement, also made clear there will be no rush toward a trial with the Senate out of session until January 19. That, largely, is due to the current security situation. \u201cI believe it will best serve our nation if Congress and the executive branch spend the next seven days completely focused on facilitating a safe inauguration and an orderly transfer of power to the incoming Biden Administration,\u201d McConnell said. By the time the trial comes to pass, McConnell will be in the minority, with Democrats set to take the majority in the days ahead. The backlash to those who split from Trump was quick to rise, however. Trump\u2019s defenders criticized Cheney and some urged her removal from her leadership position. Those arguing against impeachment said it was divisive, political and rushed, but few defended Trump\u2019s conduct outright. It\u2019s a position that will likely be echoed by Senate Republicans opposed to impeachment in the days ahead, aides say. \u201cI believe impeaching the President in such a short timeframe would be a mistake,\u201d House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said. \u201cNo investigations have been completed. No hearings have been held,\u201d he added, but also said that Trump bore responsibility for the rioters. But while 196 Republicans joined McCarthy in opposing impeachment, several told CNN their own outrage wasn\u2019t lacking. Another element had come into play. Threats to offices, members and staff had increased in the days leading up to the vote. \u201cIt may not have changed any votes, but it\u2019s hard not to weigh the potential to your family when you see some of this stuff,\u201d one Republican who opposed impeachment told CNN. Cicilline and Lieu were not on the floor when the House abruptly went into recess as hundreds of violent protesters surrounded the chamber due to to social distancing rules that limited how many lawmakers were present. But they kept in touch with those members who fled the chamber just steps away from the mob trying to break through the doors of the speaker\u2019s lobby onto the House floor. One of the members they were in touch with was Raskin, a constitutional law professor who was a leader for Democrats in the House debate to certify the Electoral College votes that the insurrectionists were trying to stop. Raskin \u2013 who had buried his 25-year-old son the day before \u2013 had brought family to the House to watch the debate Wednesday, who were evacuated along with the lawmakers and reporters in the chamber. The lawmakers continued working on the draft and consulting with Raskin as he returned to the chamber more than six hours after evacuating to finish the Electoral College debate. They looped in aides on the House Judiciary Committee, which handled the first impeachment resolution, and had buy-in from House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York. The impeachment resolution included both Trump\u2019s false rhetoric about the election as well as Trump\u2019s call to the Georgia secretary of state where he pushed him to \u201cfind\u201d votes that would make Trump the winner. \u201cI think there were some people who initially thought, \u2018Should we do this?\u201d Cicilline said. \u201cBut I think as events became clearer and people got over the horror of the moment and reflected on it, the caucus really quickly decided we have got to do something. We can\u2019t simply allow someone who led an insurrection against the US government to disrupt the Electoral College and subvert the will of the American people.\u201d There was a similar effort afoot in another part of the Capitol, as Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota put together her own impeachment resolution while in lockdown. The effort underscored the visceral reaction to the Capitol siege throughout the caucus, though Omar\u2019s draft wasn\u2019t the one the House ultimately moved forward with as the Judiciary Committee was already focused on the resolution from Lieu, Cicilline and Raskin. By the time the House held its first vote last Wednesday on an objection to Arizona\u2019s votes, Cicilline was ready to show a draft to House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. The lawmakers released a public draft the next day \u2013 with a single article of \u201cabuse of power\u201d for Trump\u2019s role in the riots \u2013 and by Friday, the article had been tweaked to charging Trump with \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d Unlike the 2019 impeachment push, there was almost no deviation within the House Democratic caucus on the need to impeach Trump. While there were some concerns raised about the precedent being set and the challenge posed to Biden\u2019s agenda, once Pence made clear he wouldn\u2019t try to remove Trump himself, Democrats said they were left with no choice. House approves resolution calling to remove Trump despite Pence rejecting 25th Amendment push \u201cI\u2019ve never seen our caucus so unified. I never saw It until this event,\u201d said one Democratic member. \u201cThe individual needs drained out.\u201d Democrats set in motion a cumbersome process to get to the impeachment vote. First they would vote on a resolution from Raskin urging Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment, before voting on impeachment. But that resolution became all but symbolic, after Pence released a letter saying that he would not do so. One House Democrat called it a \u201ctotal waste of time.\u201d Still, Democrats became more resolute about the need to impeach Trump as details continued to emerge about the events of January 6. The concerns, fears and determination to push forward spilled out on a nearly three-hour private caucus conference call just days before the vote. While leaders would need to move to address security concerns, there was nothing they needed to do to ensure the caucus stuck together on the vote itself. \u201cAs the hours progressed and more and more people were speaking within the text threads and talking to one another by phone and every other means available, there seemed to be really broad agreement,\u201d said Rep. Veronica Escobar, a Texas Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. \u201cThe momentum,\u201d she said, \u201cwas powerful.\u201d CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated that Rep. Ted Lieu grabbed a crowbar before leaving his office. He grabbed a ProBar energy bar.",

            "article_content": "As thousands of pro-Trump supporters streamed into Washington, DC, Wednesday headed first to the Ellipse to hear President Donald Trump speak, and then to the United States Capitol to lay siege to the epicenter of American democracy, first lady Melania Trump was doing a photo shoot at the White House. Professional lighting, the sort used for photography and videography, could be seen through the windows of the White House. \u201cPhotos were being taken of rugs and other items in the Executive Residence and the East Wing,\u201d a person familiar with the day\u2019s activities with the first lady told CNN. Trump \u2013 who, as CNN has reported, has expressed interest in writing a coffee table book about decorative objects she has amassed and had restored in the White House \u2013 was overseeing the photo project, said the source, with her remaining time in the White House dwindling.   Just blocks away, domestic terrorists were swarming the US Capitol in a riot that her husband had incited earlier that day at the rally. While images of the mob breaking into the Capitol consumed the airwaves, the first lady was focused \u2013 with the White House chief usher, Timothy Harleth \u2013 on getting the shoot completed. Both the media, including CNN, and members of her staff were asking if Trump had plans to tweet a statement of calm, or a call to stop the violence \u2013 something she had done a handful of times months earlier during the protests surrounding the police killing of George Floyd. She did not. Instead, the first lady was quiet, and has remained so. Her disinterest in addressing the country was indicative of being \u201cchecked out,\u201d said another White House source, who added, \u201cshe just isn\u2019t in a place mentally or emotionally anymore where she wants to get involved.\u201d Except with the furniture. By Wednesday evening, two of her first hires as first lady, chief of staff Stephanie Grisham \u2013 who also served as Trump\u2019s closest adviser, speechwriter and spokesperson \u2013 and Anna Cristina \u201cRickie\u201d Niceta, White House social secretary, had submitted their resignations effective immediately. CNN confirmed both Grisham and Niceta quit their jobs in large part because of Wednesday\u2019s events. Much has been made of the first lady\u2019s influence on her husband. But it was Ivanka Trump, the President\u2019s daughter, who held an emergency meeting with him in the Oval Office Wednesday, where she urged him to call for the violence to stop. Still, the first lady and the President, as CNN has reported, have a close relationship, which is sometimes surprising to those who have interpreted salacious stories of Trump\u2019s alleged adulterous behavior and their physical distance as a sign of a dislike. The first lady speaks on the phone throughout the day with the President, according to several sources who have witnessed it \u2013 from both wings of the building \u2013 and she is the first one to share with her husband her thoughts on domestic and international issues. Though the bulk of her public statements in recent months have been related to holiday decorations, on November 8, she tellingly tweeted her support of Trump\u2019s baseless fight against the election results. \u201cThe American people deserve fair elections,\u201d said the first lady. \u201cEvery legal - not illegal - vote should be counted. We must protect our democracy with complete transparency.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a lot, but it was enough to indicate she was on his side. First lady's chief of staff and White House social secretary resign after violent protests The first lady has also not been shy when her opinions differ from her husband\u2019s, tweeting \u2013 either on her own or via Grisham as her mouthpiece \u2013 messages that would seem to be out step with his. But this week was not one of those times. CNN has reached out multiple times to the East Wing, both before and after Grisham\u2019s departure, to ask for comment on the first lady\u2019s thoughts about Wednesday\u2019s events, or if she had any comment at all. The requests were not answered. Along with the first lady, the other three most influential people in the Trump orbit are his oldest children, Don Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump, all of whom have amplified the voice of their father after his election loss, calling for Americans to \u201cfight\u201d against what they baselessly deemed a corrupt election. Trump Jr. was part of a roster of speakers at the Ellipse Wednesday morning, more than willing to inflame an already blindly loyal and largely infuriated group of supporters. \u201cThis gathering should send a message to them. This isn\u2019t their Republican Party anymore,\u201d railed Trump Jr. \u201cThis is Donald Trump\u2019s Republican Party.\u201d He addressed lawmakers in his hype speech, which was peppered with expletives: \u201cYou can be a hero, or you can be a zero. And the choice is yours. But we are all watching. The whole world is watching, folks. Choose wisely.\u201d Eric Trump and his wife Lara spoke too, and listened with big smiles as the crowd of thousands serenaded the younger Trump with \u201cHappy Birthday;\u201d he turned 37. The couple vociferously maligned the democratic election process, and the will of American voters who elected Joe Biden as President. The crowd loved it. Trump's desperate attempt to save his imploding presidency \u201cWe live in the greatest country in the world, and we will never, ever, ever stop fighting,\u201d said Eric Trump, the word \u201cfight\u201d a dog whistle to the eager crowd who were just blocks from where they \u2013 falsely \u2013 believed their future was being dealt an illegal hand by lawmakers. Shortly after Eric and Lara left the stage, they were whisked by Secret Service to the airport \u2013 the match they helped light in the rear-view as they flew back to their multimillion dollar New York home. The President was at the rally, too, of course. The headliner, he first watched the crowd on monitors from a tented VIP area with his daughter Ivanka Trump, who did not speak at the rally, before he took the stage. Ivanka Trump would shortly be the one whose responsibility it was to press her father to publicly call for the violence to stop \u2013 but not before she sent her own tweet, referring to the Trump supporters rioting as \u201cAmerican Patriots.\u201d \u201cAmerican Patriots \u2013 any security breach or disrespect to our law enforcement is unacceptable,\u201d wrote Trump, who also said the violence must stop. After being called out for dubbing them \u201cpatriots,\u201d Trump deleted her tweet. At the White House, panic was setting in. \u201cThe President didn\u2019t want to listen to people telling him he had to get these people to stop doing this,\u201d a White House official told CNN. \u201cEveryone else was told to leave the room,\u201d a different source close to Ivanka Trump told CNN of her emergency meeting with the President in the Oval Office. Trump had been called on by multiple people, both in person in her West Wing office and from Capitol Hill, where she had multiple contacts. \u201cThe message was, \u2018President Trump has to tell these people to stop. He\u2019s the only one they\u2019ll listen to,\u2019\u201d said the source, who noted Ivanka Trump was already more than aware the rioters were wreaking irretrievable damage. In their meeting, Ivanka Trump argued her father must make an immediate, televised address to the nation, the source said. The President was hesitant, with multiple sources telling CNN he appeared at times to enjoy watching the chaos he had unleashed unfold. Trump turned down the request for an immediate televised address, but would eventually compromise with a milquetoast version of reproach from the Rose Garden, which he then tweeted. \u201cWe love you,\u201d he said in a recorded video to the people who forced lawmakers and staff to hide under chairs, scared for their lives. \u201cGo home,\u201d as though they had stayed too long at a dinner party. \u201cHe will do what he wants to do,\u201d said the source close to Ivanka, referring to the President. \u201cBut if she wasn\u2019t in there yesterday, his tweets would have been a lot different,\u201d the source added. Ivanka Trump has often received public criticism for taking credit for working \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d on issues related to the President \u2013 and this time will likely be no exception. But the source told CNN Wednesday\u2019s actions were not \u201cvirtue signaling by her.\u201d On Thursday evening, in another prerecorded video message, the President publicly conceded for the first time that he will not serve a second term, although he stopped short of congratulating Biden. With his presidency threatened by resignations and potential impeachment, Trump acknowledged that a transfer of power to a new administration is underway. Ivanka Trump and her brother Don Jr. later retweeted the video.",

In her resignation letter to Trump dated Thursday, which CNN obtained a copy of, DeVos called the rioters\u2019 behavior \u201cunconscionable\u201d and wrote, \u201cThere is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me.\u201d \u201cImpressionable children are watching all of this, and they are learning from us,\u201d she added. \u201cI believe we each have a moral obligation to exercise good judgment and model the behavior we hope they would emulate. They must know from us that America is greater than what transpired yesterday.\u201d DeVos joins Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, who had announced her resignation earlier Thursday after taking \u201ctime to absorb\u201d the insurrection on Capitol Hill and the President\u2019s response to it, according to a senior administration official. \u201cToday, there was a lot of soul-searching and discussion,\u201d a senior official said. \u201cIt was obviously the right thing to do.\u201d Resignations had started Wednesday with first lady Melania Trump\u2019s chief of staff, the White House social secretary, a deputy press secretary and Trump\u2019s deputy national security adviser all exiting before the night\u2019s end. Other officials, sources told CNN, had been considering resigning. The wave of abrupt exits came after Trump supporters \u2013 spurred by the President \u2013 had breached the Capitol on Wednesday and engulfed the nation\u2019s capital in chaos. After hundreds of pro-Trump rioters pushed through barriers set up along the perimeter of the Capitol, demonstrators eventually made their way into the building and the House floor was evacuated by police. Only after pleading from aides and congressional allies inside the besieged Capitol did Trump release a video urging the rioters to \u201cgo home,\u201d while still fanning their baseless grievances about a stolen election. DeVos had said in a statement released Wednesday in the aftermath of the breach: \u201cThe eyes of America\u2019s children and students \u2013 the rising generation who will inherit the republic we leave them \u2013 are watching what is unfolding in Washington today. We must set a better example for them, and we must teach them the solemn obligations and duties that come with the title \u2018American.\u2019\u201d A peaceful transfer of power, she said, \u201cis what separates American representative democracy from banana republics.\u201d A top Republican donor and school choice activist, DeVos was tapped to head the Department of Education in 2016. The President hailed her in a statement at the time as \u201ca brilliant and passionate education advocate.\u201d \u201cUnder her leadership we will reform the US education system and break the bureaucracy that is holding our children back so that we can deliver world-class education and school choice to all families,\u201d Trump said. While DeVos\u2019 tenure was marred by intense criticism of her education policies \u2013 particularly her support for charter schools \u2013 her eagerness and effectiveness at delivering on conservative priorities kept allies of Trump happy. Frederick M. Hess, an education policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, previously called her a \u201ctrust buster\u201d and a threat to the education establishment. That includes her advocacy for charter schools as well as rolling back of numerous Obama-era regulations and guidelines. Among these was the institution of new protections for college students accused of sexual assault, which her department called a restoration of due process. Recently, she faced considerable scrutiny internally for rarely attending coronavirus meetings, despite the heavy focus on whether schools should remain open in the spring or open as scheduled in the fall. But even in her resignation letter, DeVos touted what she called the Education Department\u2019s advocacy for \u201cforgotten students\u201d as she bemoaned how Wednesday\u2019s violence took away from the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cmany accomplishments.\u201d \u201cHolding this position has been the honor of a lifetime,\u201d DeVos said in concluding her message, \u201cand I will be forever grateful for the opportunity to serve America and her students.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information Thursday.

            "article_content": "After violent pro-Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday, a growing number of Republican leaders and Cabinet officials told CNN that they believe Donald Trump should be removed from office before January 20. Four of them called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked, and two others said the President should be impeached. \u201cHe has to be impeached and removed,\u201d said one current Republican elected official. A former senior official said the President\u2019s actions were egregious enough to remove him even with such a short time left in his tenure. \u201cI think this has been a huge shock to the system,\u201d said the former official. \u201cHow do you keep him in place for two weeks after this?\u201d Trump's presidency ends with American carnage By impeaching and removing Trump, even at this late stage of his term, the Senate could subsequently vote to disqualify Trump from ever holding federal office again. On the other hand, invoking the 25th Amendment would require Vice President Mike Pence and a majority of the Cabinet to vote to remove Trump from office due to his inability to \u201cdischarge the powers and duties of his office\u201d \u2013 an unprecedented step. On Thursday morning, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois became the first Republican member of Congress to call for Trump\u2019s removal from office. \u201cIt\u2019s time to invoke the 25th Amendment and end this nightmare,\u201d Kinzinger said in a video he published online. Some Cabinet members are holding preliminary discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment, a well-placed GOP source told CNN Wednesday night. The discussions are ongoing but it\u2019s unclear if there will be enough Cabinet members to result in Trump\u2019s removal. The conversations have reached Capitol Hill where some senators have been made aware of the discussions, the source said. Within minutes of protestors breaching the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, Republicans were revisiting the idea of removing Trump from office, a choice that nearly all of them passed on making a year ago during last year\u2019s impeachment trial. The forceful denunciations of Trump are also unprecedented. Former President George W. Bush, who has kept a low profile, released a strongly-worded rebuke Wednesday evening calling the \u201cinsurrection\u201d at the Capitol a \u201csickening and heartbreaking sight.\u201d While not mentioning Trump by name, Bush said he was \u201cappalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement.\u201d Mitt Romney, the Utah senator who was the only Republican to vote to convict the President on an article of impeachment last year, went further, calling the President a \u201cselfish man\u201d who \u201cdeliberately misinformed his supporters\u201d about the election. Romney also called the attack on the Capitol an \u201cinsurrection\u201d and blamed Trump, saying he \u201cstirred [supporters] to action this very morning.\u201d Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of the House leadership, echoed Romney\u2019s anger and frustration at Trump. \u201cThere is no question that the President formed the mob. The President incited the mob, the President addressed the mob,\u201d said Cheney on Fox News. \u201cHe lit the flame.\u201d Facebook, Twitter and YouTube take action on Trump's posts amid riots at the US Capitol And Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, an otherwise staunch ally of Trump\u2019s, was unsparing. \u201cIt\u2019s past time for the president to accept the results of the election, quit misleading the American people, and repudiate mob violence,\u201d Cotton said. Other Republicans on Capitol Hill were furious as well with the President. \u201cThe President needs to call it off,\u201d Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cCall it off! It\u2019s over. The election is over.\u201d And Rep. Kinzinger dismissed Trump\u2019s Wednesday afternoon tweet asking rioters at the Capitol to \u201cremain peaceful.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s cowardice,\u201d Kinzinger told Tapper. \u201cHe needs to stand up and say, I lost the election, let the count go ahead.\u201d But as Trump seems unlikely to make those concessions, two longtime Republican activists and allies of the White House said the President must go. \u201cPence should move against him on the 25th Amendment,\u201d said one. \u201cThey need to invoke the 25th Amendment immediately,\u201d said the other.",

View more opinion at CNN. As the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was growing more intense and deadly last week, Andrew Yang, a leading candidate for the Democratic nomination in New York City\u2019s mayoral race, shifted his focus to the Middle East. \u201cI\u2019m standing with the people of Israel who are coming under bombardment attacks, and condemn the Hamas terrorists,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThe people of NYC will always stand with our brothers and sisters in Israel who face down terrorism and persevere.\u201d That sentiment would not have been out of place in a tweet, press release or on-the-record comment by almost every major candidate for mayor of New York since the founding of the state of Israel in 1948.

Yang\u2019s tweet may have been based on genuine sentiment or it may have been pandering, but for most of the last more than 70 years, it would have been good politics. In 2021, things seem to be different. Yang\u2019s tweet was immediately attacked by Dianne Morales, one of his Democratic opponents, as well as by many other New York City progressives, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Morales has expressed a degree of support for the Palestinian people, and condemnation of Israeli actions, that would have been unimaginable from a major mayoral candidate even a decade ago. At the same time, other candidates in the race, such as Kathryn Garcia, who recently received the endorsements of The New York Times and the Daily News, and Scott Stringer, the only Jewish major candidate for mayor, offered support for Israel tempered by nuance and expressions of sympathy for the Palestinians. Two other candidates, Eric Adams, one of Yang\u2019s closest rivals, and Ray McGuire, who is on the fringe of the race, offered strong pro-Israel statements similar to Yang\u2019s. The fact that Yang\u2019s statement, on an issue with little bearing on the future of New York City, generated so much controversy, and the breadth of views candidates have on the conflict, is part of a broader development in New York City politics. In essence, the city appears to be moving away from the ethnic tribalism that has defined the city for decades. NYC mayoral candidates aimed to dent Andrew Yang's lead In most recent mayoral elections, candidates have sought to consolidate their ethnic base and build out a coalition grounded in identity-based appeals to Jews, Italian Americans, Irish Americans, Latinos, African Americans, LGBTQ voters and others. Similarly, many primaries looked more like censuses with African American, Latinos, white Catholics, Jews voting as a bloc for candidates who in many cases shared their heritage. For much of this time, it was expected that candidates for mayor would visit the \u201cthree I\u2019s\u201d of Israel, Italy and Ireland, during election years or risk losing one of the major ethnic groups in New York. Those days are now firmly in the past. None of this year\u2019s candidates this year are running these kinds of identity-based campaigns. Morales, who is on the left flank of the race, would be the first Latinx mayor of New York, but that has not been the focus of her campaign. Although Adams has a strong base among African American voters in Brooklyn, his campaign is not based primarily on appeals to African American voters, not least because he is one of four Black candidates, along with Morales, McGuire and Maya Wiley, in the race. Yang\u2019s status as a leading candidate \u2013 he was the clear frontrunner until the race tightened last week  \u2013 is only possible in post-tribal New York. While Yang has made efforts to become the choice of New York\u2019s sizable Orthodox Jewish voting bloc, the rest of his campaign has been built around name recognition from his presidential campaign, his upbeat personality and his penchant for big ideas, albeit ideas that his critics assert are rarely fleshed out. Yang would become New York\u2019s first Asian American mayor, but Asian Americans only represent about 15% of the city\u2019s population and because not all are citizens with voting rights an even smaller proportion of the electorate. Moreover, that population is very diverse, including many from South Asia as well as East Asia, and is unlikely to unify behind Yang. Many Asian New Yorkers are Muslim and were not pleased with Yang\u2019s Tweet supporting Israel.  The nature of this New York City primary, where the race, religion or gender of the candidates are much less important than issues like Yang\u2019s Covid recovery plans, Garcia\u2019s reputation for a deep understanding of governance, the progressive politics of Wiley, Stringer and Morales, and competing policy proposals on issues from housing to policing to the economy, demonstrates that something has changed in New York City. These, rather than questions of identity, have been at the center of the campaign and last week\u2019s candidate debate. It\u2019s evidence that even in one of the most heavily Democratic part of the country, identity politics are not always as central to the Democratic Party, or progressive politics, as conservatives would like us to think. It is precisely the diversity of New York City, and of this pool of primary candidates, that has rendered identity politics something of the past. In a city with so many different groups, cross-cutting affiliations and identities, and a pool of candidates that come close to reflecting that breadth, politics can no longer be a simple as taking a position on Israel that pleases one group or having a last name that is familiar to another.",

She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. The top Republican in the US House of Representatives, California Rep. Kevin McCarthy, has just announced that he will oppose a very reasonable bipartisan plan to formally investigate the January 6 attack on the Capitol, the worst assault on US democracy in living memory. The continuing effort to throw sand in the eyes of history \u2013 to gaslight the American people about what happened that day \u2013  is a thundering alarm about the future of America\u2019s democracy. And it\u2019s not just the distant future at stake. The next effort to overturn the will of the people \u2013 perhaps as soon as the 2024 presidential election \u2013 may just succeed. The repeated lies about the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 events, combined with a persistent effort to rewrite election laws in Republican-controlled state legislatures, means that if a Trump-like campaign to steal the election is waged next time, it will have a much better chance of succeeding. The safeguards aimed at protecting the voters\u2019 will are being deliberately dissolved by Republican officials. The first step in protecting the country is learning from its mistakes. That\u2019s why after the 9/11 terror attacks, Congress set up a bipartisan commission to get to the truth. The truth is required to build effective defenses. This time, it\u2019s been clear from the start that the truth is an obstacle to today\u2019s Trump-dominated GOP. Still, Democrats worked with Republicans to set up a fair, bipartisan January 6 commission. The agreement, initially reached last week, includes many elements McCarthy had demanded: an equal number of representatives from each party and a requirement that both sides approve all subpoenas. But McCarthy likely never wanted a genuine investigation. His opposition will pressure other Republicans to vote against it. McCarthy is claiming that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi negotiated in bad faith, and he is insisting that the commission should also look into a series of other events, such as  \u201cpolitical violence that has struck American cities,\u201d referring to the Black Lives Matter-led protests that erupted last summer after the murder of George Floyd. Kevin McCarthy's Trump problem As Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney \u2013 now expelled from the GOP leadership \u2013 suggested, a narrowly focused investigation \u201cthreatens [Republicans] ... who may have been playing a role they should not have been playing.\u201d McCarthy may worry about discussions of his expletive-filled phone call with then-President Donald Trump while the Capitol was under attack. While McCarthy was pleading with Trump to call off his supporters, the President flippantly replied, \u201cI guess these people are more upset about the election than you are,\u201d according to lawmakers who were briefed on the call afterward by the representative. The evidence in a January 6 investigation could be damning for Republicans close to Trump, whose words sounded to many like incitement. From former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s call for \u201ctrial by combat,\u201d (totally innocent, Giuliani\u2019s lawyer says) to the pro-Trump crowd during the rally just before the Capitol attack, to Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks\u2019 roar to the same crowd \u2013 \u201cToday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass\u201d\u2013 and the thousands of thoroughly documented social media posts by members of Congress promoting the lie about a stolen election. But many of today\u2019s GOP leaders don\u2019t want the country to learn from history. And, as philosophers and anyone endowed with common sense knows, if you don\u2019t learn from history, you may repeat it, perhaps in a more disastrous version. Democracy survived that day, but that may not happen the next time. After an assault that derailed the certification of American voters\u2019 choice of president, traumatized legislators dusted themselves off and did their job. Would they do that again? Republicans who have stood up against Trump, in Washington, DC, and across the country, are getting pushed out, getting primaried or choosing not to run again. There\u2019s a very real chance that Democrats could lose their majority in the US House of Representatives and the US Senate in next year\u2019s election. Would a majority Republican Congress, with the party likely having a higher concentration of Trumpists, defend an election result in which Democrats win? While it\u2019s true that many Republicans, particularly in the Senate, tried to keep their heads down and not participate in the madness, those who have dared to speak out, like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, have been criticized by Republicans. The Republicans who tried to overturn the election results without a smidgen of evidence of fraud are losing their passion for democracy. Their creed now is \u201cWhatever Trump Wants,\u201d even though \u2013 and we can\u2019t say this often enough \u2013 over four years, Trump led the party to lose the White House, the House and the Senate. Even more disturbing is what\u2019s happening at the state level. Using false claims that there was election fraud in 2020, legislatures in 47 states are pushing for troubling changes in voting rules. Georgia, whose newly enacted law received much attention, could serve as a model for others. Many noted mean-spirited parts of the law, like the one banning third-party groups from giving water to voters standing in line. But the more alarming parts of the law are the ones that empower the Republican-controlled legislature to remove individual counties\u2019 election officials and give the Georgia General Assembly, now dominated by Republicans, much greater power over the State Election Board. Georgia is a good example because, even though the election ran cleanly and smoothly, it was one of the states where there was a powerful effort to commit fraud \u2013 personally conducted by the former president of the United States. Who can forget Trump\u2019s phone call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, pressuring him to \u201cfind\u201d enough votes to flip the result in his favor, a fact that Trump\u2019s impeachment lawyers tried to twist at his Senate trial. Raffensperger, a Republican, stood up to the then president. The new law curtails the role of  the Secretary of State in elections, and already Georgia Republicans are punishing elected officials,  who refused to commit fraud at Trump\u2019s behest, by censoring and ostracizing them.  If the GOP was willing to help Trump in 2020, even after he all but advertised he would not accept the results if he lost, the party\u2019s willingness to transgress in his name seems to have only grown since then. Examining the past is not just an exercise for the benefit of history. It\u2019s about discovering what went wrong in order to emerge stronger. It\u2019s an effort to find weaknesses and vulnerabilities and then repair them. When a country has just lived through a coup attempt, it should urgently, honestly, examine what occurred. The problem now is that the coup attempt, even though it failed, is not really over. Trump and many of his backers maliciously insist the election was stolen. If they have their way, the next coup attempt may not fail.",

View more opinion on CNN. On January 6, we just learned, Capitol Police officers were told to look for anti-Trump protesters, rather than for the former president\u2019s devoted supporters, who ultimately overran the building in a deadly insurrection. With every revelation about the events of that infamous day, the need to piece together the entire story becomes more urgent. During a House Administration Committee hearing on Thursday, Rep. Zoe Lofgren described the orders, which were relayed in a radio call the morning of January 6 and uncovered during an ongoing review of officer conduct. According to Lofgren, who chairs the committee, the officer said, \u201cAttention all units on the field, we\u2019re not looking for any pro-Trump in the crowd. We\u2019re only looking for any anti pro-Trump who want to start a fight.\u201d But the Capitol Police issued a statement Thursday saying the call \u201chas been misquoted and is lacking \u2026 necessary context.\u201d Neither Capitol Police nor Congress released the audio of the broadcast, but the police department provided what it says is a transcript, which reads, \u201cWith regards to pedestrian traffic on \u2013 on the grounds today, we anticipate a \u2013 a large presence for pro-Trump participants. What we\u2019re looking for is any anti-Trump counter protestors.\u201d Either way, the obvious question remains: Were the Capitol Police infiltrated by the right-wing extremists who sought to deny Americans their choice of president? If they were, how much did they help? Trump's dominance spells trouble for the GOP Most officers fought courageously to protect the former vice president and the members of Congress who were certifying the results of the 2020 election inside the US Capitol. Not all did. Rep. Tim Ryan says he saw a Capitol police officer who was wearing a MAGA hat direct people around the building. Another appeared to pose for a selfie with a member of the mob. More than a dozen Capitol officers were still under investigation as of last month. In fact, the country needs a thorough investigation that looks at more than just the actions of the Capitol Police. Last month, Lofgren released a 2,000-page report cataloguing the social media posts of members of Congress, many of whom promoted Trump\u2019s big lie that the 2020 election was \u201cstolen\u201d and rallied people to \u201cfight for Trump\u201d on January 6. The report, a dizzying compendium of lies and incitement, has not received enough attention. As I wrote at the time, the words of Reps. Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Pete Sessions, and others raise the question of whether they should be removed from their posts, considering the 14th Amendment states \u201cNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress\u201d if they swear an oath to support the Constitution and have engaged  in \u201cinsurrection or rebellion\u2026or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.\u201d Also deserving of a closer examination are a number of extraordinary events that unfolded a few miles away from the US Capitol on January 6. Most remarkable was the behavior of then-President Donald Trump. As CNN and others have documented, Trump initially resisted calls to send the National Guard, even as protesters swarmed the rotunda and Capitol lobbies chanting, \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d Pence was rushed to safety, and it was he who coordinated with the Pentagon to deploy the guard and urged them to move faster. Right wing's long history of deflecting on extremism What exactly was the endgame in this assault? What did the fervently pro-Trump mob plan? How much did Trump \u2013 who promoted the day\u2019s event on Twitter, where he wrote, \u201cBig protest in DC on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\u201d \u2013 know about those plans? Who else was involved? These are not idle questions. Consider the role of Trump appointees in the delayed deployment of the DC National Guard to support the beleaguered Capitol Police in protecting members of Congress from the rampaging mob. Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund called for the support of the National Guard at around 1:49 p.m. in what Guard commander Maj. Gen. William Walker described as a \u201cfrantic\u201d call. Walker said Sund\u2019s voice was \u201ccracking with emotion\u201d as he requested assistance over what was clearly a \u201cdire emergency.\u201d But the National Guard didn\u2019t arrive until more than three hours after Sund\u2019s first desperate plea; after the Capitol had been ransacked, dozens of officers injured, a protester killed, and the constitutionally mandated joint session of Congress certifying the election results had been suspended for hours. According to Walker, he did not need authorization from the Pentagon when he deployed the National Guard at the nation\u2019s Capitol last summer. But a memo issued on January 5, which he called \u201cunusual,\u201d marked a change in guidance. Walker, who said the memo required him to seek authorization from the Pentagon, told a joint Senate panel, \u201cSo, no civil disturbance equipment could be authorized unless it came from the secretary of defense \u2026 the secretary of defense told me I needed his permission to escalate to have that kind of protection.\u201d It's not enough to cancel Marjorie Taylor Greene's 'America First' caucus Like countless top officials in the Trump administration, acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller had not been confirmed by the Senate in the role. Instead, he was installed by Trump in that powerful position on November 9 \u2013 just two days after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the 2020 election. Also curious is the role of Lt. Gen. Charles Flynn, deputy chief of staff of the Army \u2013 and brother of the disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, who twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI before he was pardoned by Trump. The Pentagon initially denied for days that Charles Flynn was involved in a key meeting on January 6 before confirming his participation. While Capitol Police and DC officials pleaded with the Pentagon to dispatch the National Guard, Flynn said he entered the room after the call began and departed before it was over, anticipating that the Army secretary would soon deploy more Guard members. It remains unclear how long Flynn was present and to what extent he participated in the call. His brother Michael, who embraced the QAnon conspiracy theory, had suggested that Trump use the military as part of the effort to overturn the election. And just one day before the riot, he attended a rally in D.C., pushing the big lie and issuing a call to action. Charles Flynn denies that his relationship with his brother played a role in his actions as the US military decided how to respond to the insurrection. The events of January 6 demand an exhaustive, impartial investigation. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has proposed one in the mold of the 9/11 Commission. The Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, however, says any commission should also look into \u201cviolent disturbances around the country last year\u201d \u2013 a mandate that would dilute the commission\u2019s work.  McConnell, like most Republicans, appears beholden to Trump, despite the former president\u2019s shocking invective against him earlier this month. It\u2019s hard to imagine that members of the GOP would be genuinely interested in finding the truth about January 6. Their behavior in the past months suggests they would be much more committed to protecting Trump and his allies. The subservience most congressional Republicans have shown Trump is astounding, particularly given that he lost the 2020 presidential election and led his party to lose control of both the House and Senate. Trump is the opposite of a winning politician, but Republicans still seem terrified of him and his backers. So, instead of trying to find out exactly what the plan was, who was involved, and what went wrong in the most serious assault on the US system of government in living memory, many remain content to promote the Big Lie. The majority of Republicans \u2013 60% in fact \u2013 incorrectly believe that the election was stolen from Trump, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found. The success of the Big Lie, which fueled the rebellion, undercuts the legitimacy of the Biden presidency, and with it the country and its democracy. The revelations about the Capitol Police on January 6 deserve more scrutiny, but much larger questions still loom: Who knew it was going to happen, who helped \u2013 and what price should they pay?",

            "article_content": "Ed Durr, a Republican who has never held elective office and is coming under fire for indicating support for QAnon and expressing Islamophobia in old tweets, will oust a powerful Democrat from New Jersey\u2019s state Senate District 3. CNN projected Friday that Durr, who spent two decades as a commercial truck driver and decided to run for the seat when he was denied a concealed carry permit for a gun, will defeat longtime state Senate President Steve Sweeney. Sweeney, the longest-tenured state Senate leader in New Jersey history, had been considered the favorite to win the South Jersey seat he was first elected to in 2001. His ouster at the hands of a Republican who, along with the two other GOP candidates on his slate, spent \u2013 as of 11 days before the election \u2013 fewer than $2,500, underscores the depth of the Election Day voter revolt against leading Democrats. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who was expected to easily win a second term, squeaked by his GOP challenger, Jack Ciattarelli, by only about two percentage points. Asked during a Fox News interview the night after the election what his priority was when he arrived at the state Capitol, Durr promised to be a \u201cvoice for the people,\u201d but was short on specifics. \u201cI really don\u2019t know. That\u2019s the key factor. I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know, so I will learn what I need to know,\u201d Durr said. \u201cI\u2019m going to guarantee you one thing: I will be the voice, and people will hear me, because if there\u2019s one thing people will learn about me, I\u2019ve got a big mouth.\u201d The Republican has already been asked to account for old tweets that were uncovered by news outlets, including CNN. CNN obtained cached and archived copies of tweets from Durr in which he indicates support for QAnon and expresses Islamophobia. In one tweet from 2019, Durr referred to the Prophet Muhammad as a \u201cpedophile\u201d and Islam as \u201ca false religion\u201d and \u201ca cult of hate.\u201d In another tweet published in the summer of 2020, Durr wrote to another Twitter user using the hashtag \u201cWWG1WGA,\u201d a well-known QAnon phrase that means, \u201cWhere we go one, we go all.\u201d Durr also expressed xenophobic ideas, tweeting in 2018 that Murphy should \u201cstop pushing #sanctuary state & inviting #illegals to our state.\u201d He added the hashtags \u201c#BuildTheWall,\u201d \u201c#NoIllegals\u201d and \u201c#MAGA.\u201d CNN also unearthed a tweet from Durr at the state\u2019s first lady, Tammy Murphy, calling Covid-19 the \u201cChina virus\u201d and blaming the \u201cinflux of #IllegalAliens\u201d for \u201cthe return of diseases.\u201d In response to an online article about police being directed to use correct pronouns for transgender people, he tweeted, \u201cNot enough that police must deal with all the issues with criminals, now they must watch what pronouns they used. Intelligence has no place in Trenton!\u201d Durr also denied climate change in a tweet, saying, \u201c1st there is no climate crisis, climate change its call seasons.\u201d He called Planned Parenthood \u201cmurderers\u201d in the same tweet. Durr\u2019s Twitter account has since been deleted. CNN has contacted Durr and Twitter for comment. In a statement to CNN affiliate KYW, the Republican apologized for his previous Islamophobic comments. \u201cI\u2019m a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment. If I said things in the past that hurt anybody\u2019s feelings, I sincerely apologize. I support everybody\u2019s right to worship in any manner they choose and to worship the God of their choice. I support all people and I support everybody\u2019s rights. That\u2019s what I am here to do, work for the people and support their rights.\u201d It is not clear if he was asked about the other offensive posts. Durr, who CNN has not been able to reach directly, agreed to meet with Muslim community leaders from his district and representatives from the Council on American-Islamic Relations next week, Selaedin Maksut, executive director of the organization\u2019s New Jersey chapter, told CNN on Friday. Durr\u2019s statement apologizing for his Islamophobic tweets prompted the council to urge him to \u201cmeet with Muslim leaders and fully repudiate his comments and address the concerns of the Muslim community.\u201d \u201cThis \u2018apology\u2019 fails to address the issues with Mr. Durr\u2019s bigoted, anti-Muslim statements. We urge him to meet with Muslim leaders and fully repudiate his comments and address the concerns of the Muslim community,\u201d the national organization tweeted. Maksut on Saturday told CNN\u2019s Evan McMorris-Santoro that his organization hopes they can change his perspective on the Muslim faith. \u201cThrough conversation and sincere dialogue, I think that people can change but it requires effort, it requires sincerity. And ultimately, there is no benefit in cornering him,\u201d Maksut said. \u201cSo, with a conversation, maybe two or three, and through experience and coming to see the community, coming to learn from his own constituents who are Muslim, we do think we can change his perspective on the faith and the people who follow the religion of Islam. It is really the only option we have. It is really our obligation as Muslims to do it.\u201d Durr in his campaign video cast Sweeney as a rubber stamp for Murphy, saying he \u201csat by and watched\u201d as Murphy mishandled the Covid-19 pandemic. Durr also criticized the state\u2019s tax policies, a staple of Ciattarelli\u2019s campaign message. \u201cThe Senate President has spent 20 years in Trenton,\u201d Durr says in the clip, which begins with him exiting the cab of a truck and ends with him riding off on a motorcycle. \u201cHigher taxes, increasing debt and rising cost of living \u2013 we deserve better. New Jersey, it\u2019s time for a change. So together, let\u2019s end single-party rule.\u201d Sweeney, who has beaten back better-organized, heavily funded challengers in the past, has not yet conceded the race. Despite the Republican\u2019s surprise victory, New Jersey\u2019s legislature will remain under Democratic control. But the backlash in New Jersey and Virginia, where Democrats lost the governor\u2019s mansion and full control of the House of Delegates, has sent shockwaves across the country. Democrats already expecting a challenging 2022 midterm election season are now scrambling to draw up a message to protect the party\u2019s fragile congressional majorities. This story has been updated with additional reporting Friday. CNN\u2019s Jennifier Agiesta and Chris Cillizza contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "City Councilor Michelle Wu will become Boston\u2019s next mayor after her more moderate challenger conceded, CNN projects, making her the first woman and person of color elected to the top post in the city\u2019s history. \u201cFrom every corner of our city, Boston has spoken. We are ready to meet this moment. We are ready to become a Boston for everyone,\u201d Wu said to a crowd of supporters Tuesday night. \u201cI want to be clear, it wasn\u2019t my vision on the ballot, it was ours, together.\u201d City Councilor Annissa Essaibi George conceded the Boston mayoral race with a large share of the vote still waiting to be counted. \u201cI want to offer a great big congratulations to Michelle Wu,\u201d Essaibi George said to a crowd of supporters at her election night party. \u201cShe\u2019s the first woman and first Asian American elected to be mayor of Boston.\u201d Wu is set to succeed acting mayor Kim Janey, Boston\u2019s first Black and female mayor. Janey, then-City Council President, was next in line to lead the city when Boston Mayor Marty Walsh was named President Joe Biden\u2019s Labor secretary in January. In the weeks leading up to the election, polls consistently showed Wu with a clear lead over Essaibi George, also a woman of color. From the beginning, this election was a remarkable departure from Boston\u2019s history. Uncontested mayoral races, where there is no incumbent seeking reelection, are hard to come by in Boston and often draw crowded primaries in the Democrat-heavy city. And in this year\u2019s unaffiliated primary, every serious contender was a person of color, and most of them were women. Championing hallmark policies like a Green New Deal for Boston, Wu racked up support from high-profile Massachussetts progressives, such as Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Sens. Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren. Pressley, who represents a portion of Boston, also served on the Boston City Council with both Wu and Essaibi George. Wu ran on a progressive platform, including calling for a fare-free transit system. While both candidates locked down support from many of Boston\u2019s powerful unions, Essaibi George touted endorsements from a number of local unions such as the Boston Firefighters, Boston EMS, electrical workers, steel workers, Massachusetts Nurses Association and more. Wu\u2019s support included 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East and the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority unions. Yet a large part of Wu\u2019s support came from more progressive organizations, such as the Working Families Party, Sunrise Movement Boston, the local chapter of the national youth-led climate group and Planned Parenthood Massachusetts. While both candidates sought to distance themselves from the familiar progressive vs. moderate divide in the Democratic party, outside sources added some pressure. Leading up to Election Day, a pro-Essaibi George super PAC ran an ad claiming that Wu wanted to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d The Wu campaign called it \u201cdishonest and desperate.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The end of the New York City\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary is near. Early voting is underway and Election Day is less than a week away, so Wednesday night\u2019s debate offered eight of the leading candidates one last chance to change the dynamic of this unpredictable and often off-kilter race. But after a long campaign, this final in-person gathering was mostly tame. And substantive. There were long stretches of pointed policy discussion encouraged by probing questions from the moderators, who clearly anticipated the candidates\u2019 talking points and challenged them for more detail. The crowded stage meant that the perceived frontrunners had less time to face-off with one another. Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, who has led the race in the limited available polling, sought to stay above the fray, which meant that with the exception of one heated exchange with former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, he seemed to disappear from it for stretches. These are the New York City mayoral primary candidates Yang came out on the front foot, but he was under attack repeatedly from New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who hammered the New York political newcomer as unfit for the job. Former Sanitation Commissioner Kathryn Garcia, who has picked up traction over the past few weeks and is now considered one of the frontrunners, delivered her most assertive debate performance \u2013 perhaps not coincidentally given its deep dive into issues like the city\u2019s homelessness and affordable housing crises. Civil rights lawyer Maya Wiley, former counsel to Mayor Bill de Blasio, has gained steam as her fellow progressives, Stringer and former nonprofit executive Dianne Morales, lost it. But even as she has emerged as the liberal favorite in the closing days and weeks of the race, Wiley\u2019s message remained the same \u2013 offering more measured plans than the city\u2019s leftist activists would like to see, but sticking by her promise to shift some of the New York Police Department\u2019s budget away from the agency and toward social services. Here are five takeaways from the final 2021 New York City Democratic mayoral primary debate: At the last debate, on a smaller stage, Adams was the center of attention. On this occasion, despite literally being front and center, he was more of a peripheral figure. And he probably didn\u2019t mind it. Adams is widely believed to be leading, if only by the slightest of margins, and with the exception of one testy exchange with Yang, mostly stayed out of the mud. Instead, he seemed content to emphasize his law-and-order message while using a lighter touch when discussing his youth, growing up poor in Queens and connecting that experience to his economic platform. When a moderator pressed Adams on his opposition to some of the more aggressive plans to offer relief to owners, he questioned the framing of the question, but ultimately maintained that universal freezes or rent forgiveness would endanger smaller landlords \u2013 many of them Black and Brown \u2013 and that there needed to be some way to separate out those renters from the larger companies. His tussle with Yang, who has sought to present himself as the better option to combat a spike in violent crime, was the debate\u2019s sharpest exchange, but hinged on a quibble over an endorsement from a police union, the Captains Endowment Association. A retired former police captain in the NYPD, the union once represented Adams, but announced this week that it was backing Yang. Asked why he should be trusted on public safety issues over Adams, Yang pointed to their support. \u201cThe people you should ask about this are Eric\u2019s former colleagues in the police captains union,\u201d Yang said. \u201cPeople who worked with him for years, people who know him best.\u201d Adams countered by insisting that he never sought their blessing, which Yang disputed, citing reporting to the contrary. \u201cI never went in front of them,\u201d Adams replied, as the two entered into what appeared to be a semantic debate over what constituted seeking an endorsement. For months, Yang was widely believed to be leading the race. But that perception is mostly gone with Adams overtaking him as the insiders\u2019 favorite and Garcia and Wiley rising. Not that you would have known it watching on Wednesday night. Yang came under the sharpest attacks and most vigorous questioning over the two hours, most notably by Stringer, who cast Yang as dangerously unqualified to lead the city. Stringer, whose stock has slipped after twice being accused of sexual harassment related to incidents two and three decades ago (he has denied both allegations), ripped into Yang\u2019s answer on how he would combat homelessness among the mentally ill. Among Yang\u2019s suggestions was a promise to \u201crebuild the stick of psych beds in our city,\u201d a number that has decreased. As Yang finished, Stringer interjected. \u201cThat is the greatest non-answer I\u2019ve ever heard in all of our debates,\u201d Stringer said. \u201cNot one specific idea, not one specific plan. You started out this campaign talking about using hotels, now you\u2019re into psych beds.\u201d Adams could be heard chuckling as Stringer attacked, but otherwise kept quiet. Yang has improved as a candidate during the course of the campaign, but his lack of experience in city politics, a narrative bolstered by the occasional gaffe, has made him an easy debate stage target \u2013 one at which Stringer, on Wednesday, took repeated aim. Of the candidates onstage, only Morales, the left-most in the field, has embraced the \u201cdefund\u201d movement. Wiley has proposed moving $1 billion from the NYPD budget toward social services, but has stopped far short of activists\u2019 demands. Still, when the moderators asked the candidates to single out the \u201cworst\u201d ideas they had heard from their rivals, \u201cdefund\u201d popped up again and again. \u201cThese are complicated times and several of my opponents are using hashtags,\u201d Garcia said, citing \u201cDefund the Police,\u201d before adding, \u201cI just don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach. You need to sit down and really think through these things.\u201d Wiley\u2019s deliberate message, though, also came under some new scrutiny when she was asked by the moderators what she would do \u2013 in the short-term \u2013 to address the rise in violent crime, a question she mostly side-stepped before returning to her core message on public safety and police. \u201cHere\u2019s the reality: we are hiring police officers to do the job of social workers,\u201d Wiley said. \u201cWe are hiring police officers to do the job of psychologists.\u201d As he did on a few occasions, Adams pushed back against the framing of a question about his own plans to step-up policing by \u2013 among other things \u2013 reviving a disbanded plainclothes anti-crime unit. \u201cI don\u2019t want to return to anything,\u201d Adams said, rejecting the suggestion he would ramp up controversial practices, like \u201cstop and frisk,\u201d the use of which has plummeted since former Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s departure. \u201cI want to show how to use tools correctly.\u201d When de Blasio first ran for mayor in 2013, ending \u201cstop and frisk\u201d abuse and \u2013 perhaps as importantly \u2013 creating free, universal pre-Kindergarten were the clear highlights of his pitch to voters. The candidates this time out, as the term-limited de Blasio prepares to leave office, are awash in policy papers and plans, but none has emerged with anything quite so captivating. In fact, despite their criticism of the mayor, universal pre-K, which de Blasio delivered, has been roundly applauded by the field. Perhaps ironically, this final debate, for all its substance, ultimately added to the sense of muddle. A long stretch of discussion about homelessness \u2013 both as it relates to affordable housing and, separately, as a mental health issue \u2013 offered voters a range of options and mostly thoughtful policy pitches. Public safety questions, too, were mostly answered with nuance. Even Adams and Yang, as they vie to win over New Yorkers who want a more assertive police presence, sketched out plans for preventive measures \u2013 the kinds of policies that address the root causes of violent crime. But the debate has been circumscribed by the specter of a difficult and protracted post-pandemic recovery and concerns over how the city will pay for itself after federal stimulus funds run out. The New York City of 2013, with crime down and dropping and the economy growing, seems a long way away \u2013 a reality that could, in the end, benefit Garcia\u2019s bid. More than anyone else, she on Wednesday night \u2013 as she has throughout the campaign \u2013 leaned into her management experience and a pledge to keep the drama levels in her potential administration to a minimum. \u201cI am not running to get the title of mayor,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI am running to do the job of mayor.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a candidate on the stage Wednesday, no matter their odds, that did not have at least a handful of noteworthy endorsements to brag about. But the touting of support \u2013 whether from influential New York political figures or powerful labor unions \u2013 was largely (strangely?) absent from the debate. Adams has robust support from some of the largest unions in the city, but he barely mentioned them. Wiley was endorsed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and, as she consolidates progressives, a collection of young and popular state lawmakers. She only briefly alluded to it. Yang\u2019s mention of his endorsement by the police captains union was more of a cudgel against Adams than anything else. Stringer talked about his support from the United Federation of Teachers \u2013 but only after he was asked how he would manage contract negotiations with them. (He said those kinds of discussions should happen in private.) Garcia offered the most robust rundown of her slate of endorsers, citing the editorial boards of the New York Times and New York Daily News, along with Planned Parenthood, the League of Conservation Voters and StreetsPAC, a political group dedicated to bike safety.",

            "article_content": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell gave a stark warning Tuesday about how Republicans would grind the chamber to a halt if Democrats changed the filibuster rules, leading to a \u201ccompletely scorched earth Senate.\u201d The Kentucky Republican defended the 60-vote threshold on the legislative filibuster in a floor speech, cautioning Democrats that if they moved to change the rules of the filibuster, it would not open up an express lane for the Biden administration to push through their agenda. Instead, Republicans would use every rule and option at their disposal to halt the chamber, making the Senate \u201cmore like a 100-car pileup, nothing moving.\u201d Majority Whip Dick Durbin told reporters he\u2019s not concerned about McConnell\u2019s threats to slow the Senate if Democrats change the filibuster because \u201che has already done that.\u201d McConnell also laid out the conservative agenda Republicans would swiftly move on the next time they take control of Congress and White House, most of which Democrats would vehemently oppose \u2013 like defunding Planned Parenthood. The pendulum would swing both ways, \u201cand it would swing hard,\u201d he warned. McConnell listed some of the legislation his party would move on when they\u2019re back in power. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t just erase every liberal change that hurt the country \u2013 we\u2019d strengthen America with all kinds of conservative policies with zero, zero input from the other side,\u201d he said pointing to how the GOP would move swiftly to defund sanctuary cities and Planned Parenthood, add new protections for the right to life of the unborn, work on concealed carry laws, and a new era of domestic energy production.\u201d Covid relief wasn't the only pressing issue facing Congress. Here are 6 others He also noted that when former President Donald Trump pressured Republicans to eliminate the filibuster, Democrats were up in arms. \u201cMy colleagues and I have refused to kill the Senate for instant gratification,\u201d he said. McConnell also asked whether Democrats truly believe the election of President Joe Biden and a 50-50 Senate is a sign that the American people want sweeping change. \u201cDoes anyone really believe the American people were voting for an entirely new system of government by electing Joe Biden to the White House and a 50-50 senate? This is a 50-50 Senate. There was no mandate to completely transform America by the American people on November 3. That may be what a few liberal activists want, but does anyone believe that millions of Americans thought that\u2019s what they were electing? Of course not.\u201d In a floor speech, Durbin pushed back hard on the Republican leader\u2019s warnings, arguing it was McConnell\u2019s abuse of the filibuster that led to Democrats\u2019 frustration and desire to get rid of it. \u201cWhen Senator McConnell and others come to the floor and plead for us to hang on to the traditions of the Senate, I would tell you that their interpretation of the traditions is strangling this body,\u201d he said, noting how many Democrats are frustrated by the current state of procedure that makes it exceedingly difficult to pass comprehensive legislation. \u201cIf I became skeptical of the filibuster, it\u2019s because of your use of it,\u201d said the Illinois Democrat, speaking directly to McConnell. \u201cAnd I hope that you understand that you can\u2019t have it both ways. It can\u2019t be a rare procedure and be a procedure that dominates the actual business of the Senate as this has done for so many years.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Virginia Republicans will win at least 50 seats in the House of Delegates, a feat that furthers the GOP\u2019s sweep of the commonwealth\u2019s top executive offices in Tuesday\u2019s election. CNN projected Thursday that Republicans in the state will win at least half of the seats in the chamber, guaranteeing that Democrats will no longer hold full control there. CNN has not projected that Republicans will take control of the House. Democrats are projected so far to win 46 seats. The best the party could do at this point is tie the number of Republican seats, but Democrats would need to win the remaining unprojected races to do so. A tie would mean a power sharing agreement between the two parties. If Republicans win even one of those four unprojected seats, they will control the chamber. Five of the projected Republican wins are pick-ups and the shift in power \u2013 paired with Republicans Glenn Youngkin, Winsome Sears and Jason Miyares capturing the state\u2019s governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general posts, respectively \u2013 underscores a broad political reckoning after years of Democratic control. Exit polls from 2017 and 2021 show the key groups that helped Youngkin turn Virginia red In recent years, Virginia Republicans had little recourse as Democrats enacted a progressive agenda, passing legislation that tightened gun control, expanded reproductive rights and offered protections for LGBTQ individuals. Virginia lawmakers also ratified the Equal Rights Amendment after years of trying and rolled back a number of laws Democrats described as \u201carchaic.\u201d But Republicans succeeded in casting some of those policies as Democratic overreach, while painting the party as soft on crime. The strategy secured turnout in rural, conservative areas without alienating suburban voters. The GOP pick-ups have the potential to deliver the party a jolt of momentum heading into 2022 and stand as an ominous warning to Democrats as the state\u2019s off-year elections \u2013 where voters take to the ballot box a year after the presidential election \u2013 are often seen as a referendum on a new White House. Though Youngkin came into the race as largely a blank slate with unlimited money, his success validates his strategy of largely focusing on local issues and lauding former President Donald Trump at times while also keeping him at arm\u2019s length. 8 takeaways from the 2021 elections \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on Democrats to be loud and clear about what we\u2019re for and not just running against Donald Trump,\u201d an adviser to President Joe Biden told CNN Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s also clear that voters are unhappy about inaction and this drives home the point that Democrats in Congress should move quickly on our agenda.\u201d Democratic control of Virginia\u2019s state Senate, where members don\u2019t face election until 2023, may still remain a roadblock to the GOP, but Democrats\u2019 razor thin margin in the chamber means it could struggle to block some conservative overhauls. And the new base of power in Richmond will likely lead to new policy discussions on a host of issues. House Republican Leader Todd Gilbert said in a statement Wednesday that the party plans to work with Younkin to \u201crestore fiscal order, give parents the voice they deserve in education, and keep our Commonwealth safe. Our work begins now.\u201d \u201cVirginia voters made an historic statement, delivering a clear rebuke of the failed policies of the last two years and electing Republicans up and down the ballot,\u201d Gilbert said.",

            "article_content": "Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic attorney general Josh Shapiro, who fought against former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in the state, announced Wednesday that he is running for governor. \u201cI understand people feel like our politics are divided and broken right now, but we can\u2019t just take our ball and go home. There\u2019s too much on the line,\u201d Shapiro said in a campaign video released Wednesday. \u201cWe all have a responsibility to show up, stand up and fight for what\u2019s right. As governor, I\u2019ll stay in the game \u2013 no matter what.\u201d In a speech formally kicking off his campaign in Pittsburgh, Shapiro vowed to make government more efficient and called for investments in state health care, education and infrastructure. \u201cAs a commonwealth, we\u2019re facing some serious challenges right now, many of them laid bare by Covid \u2013 from health care to education to the workforce,\u201d he said. Shapiro said as governor that he \u201cwon\u2019t hesitate to use that veto pen\u201d to protect voting rights, reproductive rights, and the right to organize. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat first elected in 2014, is term limited, leaving the field wide open. A handful of Republican candidates, including former US Rep. Lou Barletta, former US attorney Bill McSwain and GOP strategist Charlie Gerow, are also vying to be the next governor. During Wednesday\u2019s campaign event, Shapiro took a swing at his Republican rivals, saying \u201cthey\u2019re passing the far-right litmus test, and they\u2019re pandering to the special interests.\u201d He also slammed Republicans backing a partisan review of the 2020 election, arguing that they are doing \u201creal damage to our democracy\u201d and \u201cholding us back from meeting this moment.\u201d While warning that \u201cour fundamental rights are at risk right now,\u201d Shapiro said he would \u201ccontinue to stand up to the attacks on our democracy,\u201d strengthen voter intimidation laws and improve the mail-in ballot process as governor. Shapiro was narrowly elected the state\u2019s top prosecutor in 2016. He formerly served on the Board of Commissioners in Montgomery County and in the Pennsylvania state House. Shortly after he was sworn in as attorney general, Shapiro put the \u201cfull force\u201d of his office behind a grand jury investigation into sexual abuse in the Catholic Church. The investigation resulted in a damning report that found that more than 300 \u201cpredator priests\u201d had been credibly accused of sexually abusing more than 1,000 child victims in six Pennsylvania dioceses over the past seven decades. Shapiro was reelected in 2020 by nearly 5 percentage points and started his second term as attorney general in January. He joins Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs in running for governor after defending the 2020 vote count in their states. Hobbs launched her campaign for Arizona governor in June.
