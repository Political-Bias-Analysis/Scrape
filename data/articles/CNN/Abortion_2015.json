            "article_content": "Nearly every federal agency is hacked. ISIS\u2019 contact with U.S. sympathizers worries law enforcement. Women may soon have their own version of Viagra. It\u2019s Thursday, and here are the 5 things to know for your New Day. Rubio\u2019s in: A day after Hillary Clinton joined the 2016 fray, Marco Rubio jumped in. In a speech yesterday at Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, the 43-year-old Florida senator made it clear he would contrast his youth against leaders and ideas \u201cstuck in the 20th century,\u201d an undeniable swipe at Clinton and fellow Floridan Jeb Bush. Rubio is the third Republican to join the race, but soon there will be another: Ben Carson is expected to launch his presidential bid on May 4 in Detroit. Many consider Carson \u2013 a retired neurosurgeon who has never held elected office \u2013 to be a long shot, but he\u2019s actually polling ahead of some GOP heavyweights, such as Rubio and Mike Huckabee. New charges, new audio: Another officer is charged in the death of an unarmed man after a shooting captured on video. This time it\u2019s a sheriff\u2019s deputy in Oklahoma who shot a man in the back during an undercover sting. The deputy thought he had grabbed his Taser instead of his handgun. The deputy, Robert Bates, was charged with second-degree manslaughter. One more twist in this case: Bates is a 73-year-old insurance company CEO who works as a reserve deputy and has been a big donor to the sheriff\u2019s department, leading some to allege that he \u201cpaid big money to play cop.\u201d Meanwhile, in North Charleston, South Carolina, fired police Officer Michael Slager is heard in audio recorded right after the deadly shooting he was involved in last week nervously laughing while talking to another officer. In a second piece of audio, he talks on the phone with who is believed to be his wife. Slager was charged with murder and fired after he shot and killed Walter Scott. One year: It\u2019s hard to believe, but the nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls abducted by Boko Haram have been missing for a solid year. A handful of them managed to escape, but the fate of the vast majority of the girls is unknown. The anniversary of the kidnapping is spurring new calls for their release and putting new pressure on the government of Nigeria, and its new president. Malala Yousafzai \u2013 the 17-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who was almost killed by the Taliban for going to school \u2013 released an open letter to the girls yesterday. In it she tells them they are not forgotten and that \u201cwe will not rest until you have been reunited with your families.\u201d Sentenced: Jodi Arias will spend the rest of her life in prison. Period. She won\u2019t get out early. That was the sentence handed down by the judge in the high-profile case, after two juries were unable to agree on her punishment. Maricopa County Judge Sherry Stephens could have sentenced Arias to life with the possibility of early release after 25 years, but decided her crime called for little leniency. Arias expressed remorse for the gruesome 2008 murder of Travis Alexander, saying she was \u201cdisgusted and repulsed\u201d with what she had done. More are insured: The (never-ending) battle over Obamacare rages on, but as it does, many more Americans have gotten health insurance. Nearly nine out of 10 Americans have health insurance now, according to a new poll from Gallup. It\u2019s the lowest percentage of Americans without coverage since Gallup first started tracking the number in 2008, and it\u2019s a big increase from two years ago before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Big bunny: Meet Darius, the world\u2019s biggest rabbit. Cats rule: Especially when they battle dogs at the pool. Gymnasts rule: Best. Seesaw. Game. Ever. Just plain annoying: These three dogs seem to annoy the heck out of each other \u2013 and everybody else. Sky high five: When you\u2019re in the French Alps, you need a wingsuit to do a high five.",

In the spare new 30-second ad, titled \u201cAbout,\u201d Rubio speaks directly to the camera as he frames the stakes of the 2016 election. \u201cThis election is about the essence of America,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout all of us who feel out of place in our own country.\u201d \u201cA government incredibly out of touch, and millions with traditional values branded bigots and haters,\u201d Rubio said. The pitch is a pointed appeal to the Republican Party\u2019s social conservative base, which is critical to success in the Republican primary, and has been energized in recent years by political fights over same-sex marriage, religious liberty and abortion. Rubio also addresses top economic and foreign policy issues in the new ad, with lines highlighting important 2016 topics like wage growth, terrorism and America\u2019s standing in the world. \u201cThis about the greatest country in the world \u2013 and acting like it,\u201d Rubio says, in a line evoking Trump\u2019s trademark slogan \u201cMake America great again.\u201d Rubio has been rising in recent weeks in national and early state surveys, regularly finishing in the top three, but he has struggled to dent front-running Trump\u2019s dominant polling lead. Cruz\u2019s recent surge threatens Rubio\u2019s chance to emerge as the second option in the 2016 Republican primary. Recognizing that dynamic, Rubio and Cruz have traded a few shots at each other in recent weeks, and the two will likely get a chance to do so again Tuesday at the last GOP primary debate of the year in Las Vegas, hosted by CNN.",

In light of Trump\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States, the Twisted Sister lead singer said that even though he told Trump a few months ago that he could use his song \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It,\u201d he\u2019s starting to rethink that decision. Snider said that he had become friends with Trump after his appearances on \u201cCelebrity Apprentice,\u201d and still considers Trump a friend, despite the controversial comments he\u2019s made during his presidential election. \u201cBut what\u2019s going on now has me questioning whether allowing the song to continue to be used. And it\u2019s very upsetting to me because I strongly don\u2019t agree with his extremist positions, and it\u2019s not so much, I know the man\u2019s not a racist, he\u2019s a friend of mine, but when you\u2019ve got white supremacy groups aligning themselves with you and you don\u2019t denounce them,\u201d Snider said in an interview with Shad of CBC\u2019s radio show \u201cQ\u201d on Thursday. \u201cThat\u2019s a problem for me.\u201d RELATED: Paul Ryan won\u2019t go there on Donald Trump Snider added that he\u2019s going to call Trump about the song. \u201cI have to speak to him, as a friend,\u201d Snider said. \u201cHe was respectful enough to call me and say, \u2018How do you feel about me using this?\u2019 And I\u2019ve got to be, as a friend respectful enough to call him and say, \u2018Listen man, this has gotten wildly out of control and I really have a problem with it, as so many people do.\u2019 \u201c Who have celebrities endorsed for the 2016 election? He said that the version of Trump that he knows is different than the Trump that the public knows. \u201cMy Donald Trump was a Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cMy Donald Trump is pro-choice. My Donald Trump is what we call a Northeastern Republican, you know, fiscally conservative, socially liberal. But that\u2019s changing.\u201d RELATED: How would a Trump independent bid work? Snider said that he has previously not allowed other politicians who oppose abortion rights to use his music, such as GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan in 2012. Snider isn\u2019t the first musician to not want Trump to play his music at rallies. Steven Tyler of Aerosmith sent Trump a cease-and-desist letter for using \u201cDream On\u201d at his campaign rallies and R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe blasted Trump for playing \u201cIt\u2019s the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\u201d on the campaign trail.",

Democrats target Republican Senate candidates over Planned Parenthood \u201cExtremists made the 2016 election about attacking reproductive rights,\u201d Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards, who was grilled extensively on Capitol Hill in September, said in a video announcing the effort Tuesday. The group is planning to focus on the White House and Senate races in a few key states, including New Hampshire, Ohio, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

            "article_content": "Bush was asked whether he thinks Rubio could beat Clinton next November He argued Clinton wasn't as transparent and Republicans need to put up a nominee that can compete with her background Jeb Bush argued Wednesday that he\u2019d be a \u201cbetter bet\u201d than Marco Rubio in a general election matchup against Hillary Clinton, but he appeared to be at odds with his own super PAC over a potential attack strategy against the Florida senator. Speaking to reporters after holding a town hall here, Bush was asked whether he thinks Rubio, whose relationship with the former Florida governor goes back more than a decade, could beat Clinton next November. \u201cI\u2019m a better bet,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI got a proven record and I campaign in a way that\u2019s based on that record and based on ideas that I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve been vetted. I\u2019ve been tested. I\u2019m an open book.\u201d He argued Clinton wasn\u2019t as transparent and Republicans need to put up a nominee that can compete with her background. His comments echoed an internal memo from his campaign last month that labeled Rubio a \u201crisky bet\u201d because of his lack of experience and questions over his use of a state GOP credit card. Earlier this week, The New York Times reported that the pro-Bush group, Right to Rise, was considering a $20 million negative campaign against Rubio that included a strategy to paint him as too extreme on abortion. Rubio has stated that he\u2019s never advocated for allowing exceptions in abortion cases, like rape or incest. Asked if he agreed with that strategy, Bush said, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should attack someone who\u2019s pro-life.\u201d Though Bush does favor allowing exceptions, he declared himself \u201cthe most pro-life candidate on that stage\u201d and listed a number of steps that Florida took to try and limit abortions, like requiring parental notification and eliminating partial birth abortion. Pressed further on whether he would disavow Right to Rise if the group ends up running ads against Rubio over his abortion stance, Bush repeated himself: \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should attack someone who\u2019s pro-life.\u201d Although Bush didn\u2019t try to land any attack lines against Rubio in Tuesday night\u2019s debate over missing Senate votes \u2013 as he attempted in the last event \u2013 he resumed such criticism on Wednesday during the town hall. \u201cI think that people, when they show up, they ought to work. I just don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s such a complex thing,\u201d he said to applause at the event, which was held in a Coca-Cola bottling facility. This time, however, he drew an analogy to a time when Bush could have possibly walked away from his job but didn\u2019t. In his final year as governor, he was being considered to be the next NFL commissioner. \u201cBut I had nine more months to go (in his second term),\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t even cross my mind that I would leave early. I put my hand on the Bible that I was governor of the state of Florida to uphold the law, and that meant to me that it was from the beginning to the end. \u201c Bush was widely seen as delivering a stronger debate performance Tuesday night. With his drop in poll numbers, Bush had perhaps the most at stake and his campaign hired a media coach to help him have stronger command of the debate stage. Last week, Bush told reporters that the coach was teaching him to not answer questions directly, but to use the time as a chance to get his own message out. Asked Wednesday if he felt that he should have adopted that advice earlier, given that it lead to a better debate performance, Bush grew candid and appeared to still be grappling with the new technique. \u201cI\u2019ve had 62 years of life that\u2019s been jammed into my DNA that when someone asks you a question, you\u2019re supposed to answer it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn my time as governor, we had lively conversations with people in the press, and I didn\u2019t do a little you know kabuki dance around it, I took \u2018em on. Even our friends from the other teams, they come, I don\u2019t care, bring it on baby.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the way I\u2019ve been trained to do it, so now I\u2019m learning the new art of acknowledging the question, being respectful of the questioner of course and then answering what\u2019s on my mind,\u201d he added. Asked if that\u2019s a change from his gubernatorial runs in 1998 and 2002, Bush quipped, \u201cThat\u2019s a change from 1953 when I was a little baby.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Keep the Promise II has not reserved any television time and has no plans to air advertisements until March or April The Keep the Promise groups have raised over $38 million Dropped plans to run 9,600 60-second biographical spots in South Carolina Ted Cruz enjoys millions of dollars in super PAC money but he may have to wait until after the first round of primaries before he can reap the benefits of that unlimited cash. The Keep the Promise set \u2013 four super PACs which have collected more than $38 million to independently support Cruz\u2019s surging bid \u2013 is struggling to show signs of life that can satisfy budding external pressure from both the official campaign and other Cruz allies. Keep the Promise II, the group funded with $10 million from Houston investor Toby Neugebauer, has not reserved any television time and has no plans to air advertisements until March or April, according to a leader of the super PACs, who requested anonymity to outline internal thinking in detail. The group was intended to be the main super PAC that purchased television spots, while the other two groups focused on radio and digital advertising. But right after Neugebauer, a controversial figure in some Cruz circles, delivered a PowerPoint presentation to Cruz donors during an exclusive campaign retreat at The Broadmoor resort this summer in Colorado, he abruptly pulled back on a planned major television campaign. The buy, which would have been for a substantial series of 9,600 60-second biographical spots, or a biopic, across South Carolina, a critical stop coming as the first southern state after the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. The source said the sudden decision came after a non-profit affiliated with Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign made its own purchase, jacking up television rates statewide. Other sources dispute that, saying the abandoned TV campaign was scuttled by legal questions about the perception of coordinating with the campaign. The super PACs are staffed in part by a few individuals with no formal political experience, including Neugebauer, who has been the groups\u2019 main fundraiser and formerly its chief executive officer \u2013 in addition to one of its lead donors. The groups have only recently begun hiring their first political professionals, including a new professional fundraiser: Campbell Smith, a finance official at the National Rifle Association, the super PACs confirmed to CNN. The ditched buy is at the heart of the dispute between the campaign and the super PAC \u2013 a dispute that spilled out into the public this week, with several campaign advisers telling Politico that they want to see Keep the Promise purchase advertising time immediately. Campaigns and super PACs frequently read one another\u2019s messages in the press with a fine-toothed comb to learn thinking that they cannot legally directly share with one another. Related: Top Walker strategist joins Cruz\u2019s campaign It\u2019s a reflection of the divided campaign finance world, where super PACs are allowed to raise unlimited amounts of cash (donations must still be reported to the Federal Election Commission), but the catch is that campaign and super PAC officials aren\u2019t allowed to coordinate. Neugebauer\u2019s pitch at The Broadmoor came without Cruz staffers in the room, for instance, a donor said. And amid increasing questions about the super PAC, campaign officials are coming to the defense of Neugebauer, who left his role at the super PAC in a shake-up, and are praising his ability to incentivize two more eight-digit donations with a $10 million check of his own. \u201cHe is an extraordinarily talented leader \u2013 a hugely successful businessman, a mega-fundraiser and a proven political visionary,\u201d said Chad Sweet, the Cruz campaign chairman, who added that the campaign was \u201cgrateful for what we see him doing from afar.\u201d \u201cHe has already demonstrated that he knows exactly what to do and when to do it.\u201d Cruz himself expressed his support. \u201cToby is a close friend and someone I admire and respect greatly,\u201d he said in a brief interview outside the Senate chamber this week. Neugebauer declined to comment through a super PAC spokeswoman, Laura Barnett. But his group is now closely monitoring available inventories before making its first buy, using the talents of a volunteer with a background in high frequency trading to analyze when it can earn the best rate, according to the super PAC source. The group has no plans to be up this year, ideally preserving its cash until March or April when other allied groups have depleted their budgets. Meanwhile, Cruz continues to attract deep-pocketed backers. His campaign and super PACs have executed list swap agreements, and Cruz continues to be one of the few favorites of most of the major fund-raising circles: the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Club for Growth, and the Koch Brothers\u2019 political network. One of those Koch donors, Darwin Deason, may soon create another Cruz super PAC, potentially Keep the Promise IV, pending a final donation from the family, CNN has learned. Deason gave $5 million to a similarly personalized super PAC supporting Rick Perry earlier this summer and recently committed to Cruz. Deason\u2019s son, Doug, did not respond to requests for comment. Cruz has praised his campaign for its cheapness, saying its low spending positioned it to have more cash on hand at the beginning of October than any other Republican campaign. And despite not having spent nearly any money on paid media, Cruz now sits in the top four in national polling \u2013 on top of candidates such as Jeb Bush, whose super PACs have spent millions of dollars that hasn\u2019t translated to increased support. That\u2019s another reason why super PAC officials have been reluctant to pull the trigger: there\u2019s no need, at this point, they say. But given emerging calls from Cruz headquarters for the super PACs to begin making purchases, the South Carolina buy seems to be a commitment the campaign maybe wishes had been made. \u201cFor someone like Cruz who spends a lot of time in Iowa, it\u2019s not all that unusual for them to spend less on TV and then to be saving money for later states,\u201d said Carl Forti, a top unaligned super PAC operative who produced television to support Mitt Romney in 2012. \u201cLooking at super PACs as a whole, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s anything traditional this cycle \u2013 so this fits right in.\u201d Related: Ted Cruz calls a one-on-one with Marco Rubio a \u2018plausible outcome\u2019 It remains unclear why the group, at one point, discarded its plans. The defense of Neugebauer\u2019s group does not square with advertising records, which show that the Rubio non-profit group, Conservative Solutions Project, only made a big advertising purchase in South Carolina in the third quarter. It did reserve millions of dollars in spots around the time of the retreat at The Broadmoor, but those advertisements were to air in the opening months of 2016, not this fall. But the source who disagreed cautioned that there may be another reason why the Neugebauer plan was abandoned: The campaign\u2019s uploading of hours of unedited B-roll footage to a little-known YouTube account, which was discovered by BuzzFeed. After filming Cruz events and splicing the video with footage from the YouTube account, lawyers got skittish over what is ordinarily a common practice for outside groups: Would it appear that the super PAC was coordinating with the campaign by launching TV ads so soon after the YouTube upload? Texas-based Landtroop Strategies, a media buying firm which has previously worked with Neugebauer, was involved in negotiations with at least one TV station \u2013 WSPA in Spartanburg, South Carolina \u2013 and asked for \u201cpre-emptible rates as long as they will fly (understanding we may have to adjust as more candidates/PACs weigh in),\u201d according to a July 6 email obtained by CNN. \u201cThat did never come to fruition. It kept being pushed down the road and pushed down the road,\u201d said Pam Keyser-Baker, the station\u2019s sales manager, who estimated the scuttled three-month buy was worth $120,000 and disputed the idea that Rubio\u2019s group made the Cruz rate jump wildly. Related: Ted Cruz announces backing of Rick Perry donors, endorsements The super PAC did pay a fee to both the media buying firm and the creators of the spots, Revolution Pictures, according to a super PAC leader. Neugebauer, the son of Rep. Randy Neugebauer, is close with both Cruz and his wife Heidi, but has no formal political experience. Before the campaign launch, Neugebauer \u2013 described by associates as hard-charging and at times abrasive \u2013 was tasked with raising money for the groups, and while he has no formal role, sources say he directs the operation more broadly from behind the scenes. \u201cHe\u2019s a hyper-fast moving type of guy,\u201d said Saul Anuzis, a Republican strategist working for the campaign in Michigan. \u201cWhen he sits across from you and says, \u2018I\u2019m making a commitment and I\u2019m asking you to make a commitment,\u2019 \u2013 he\u2019s not benefiting from it financially or politically in any way \u2013 I think that\u2019s a pretty powerful selling tool to have.\u2019 This summer, Neugebauer stepped back from day-to-day operations and was replaced primarily by David Barton, a Texas operative with deep ties to the nation\u2019s pastors. One major super PAC donor, Tom Patrick, said he hadn\u2019t heard from Neugebauer in months. Like Barton, the three groups tied to the three anchor families all have religious tones. Keep the Promise III, backed solely by $15 million from Texas fracking giants Farris and Dan Wilks, is breaking through in digital organizing via its Reigniting the Promise project, with a months-old Facebook page that has quickly earned more than 350,000 likes. That group is advised by Jon Francis, a Wilks family member and the manager of their philanthropic giving, along with a coterie of anti-abortion activists from a group called Online for Life, who have no prior experience in partisan politics. Keep the Promise I, funded by Long Island billionaire Robert Mercer and helmed by Kellyanne Conway, a well-regarded GOP political operative, is focusing a $1 million radio campaign on Christian channels in Iowa, where Cruz is increasingly polling well. The $11 million group is also diversifying its portfolio and hiring organizers in the states. Jeff King, an Iowa political operative and son of powerful Rep. Steve King, is leading a growing field team in the Hawkeye State, and there are plans to staff up in South Carolina as well to supplement the official campaign field team \u2013 which it\u2019s bumping into on the trail. \u201cThere will probably be a little overlap that we don\u2019t know about. But it\u2019s probably better to have too much than not enough,\u201d said King. \u201cWith the Iowa caucus, we know the model to be successful isn\u2019t necessarily running a thousand points a week for three weeks on TV.\u201d",

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush is promoting his new e-book, \"Reply All,\" which was released Monday While governor of Florida, Bush was known as a prolific email who always had his Blackberry in hand Jeb Bush is telling the story of his Florida governorship through his favorite form of communication: email. In his new e-book, \u201cReply All,\u201d which was released Monday, the struggling Republican candidate was known as a prolific emailer \u2013 a Blackberry can be seen in his official portrait \u2013 and exchanged messages with staffers, constituents and reporters for up to 30 hours a week, according to his campaign. The book addresses Bush\u2019s policy record \u2013 including his budget line item vetoes, school voucher programs, Everglades restoration, elimination of affirmative action, hurricane recovery efforts, and child welfare reform. But it also included a few other colorful moments: The book includes a couple of references to Bush\u2019s now-presidential rival Marco Rubio, who served in the Florida House of Representatives while Bush was governor. One email gave a behind-the-scenes look at what\u2019s become an often-mentioned anecdote in the media as the two are now running against each other. \u201cI need to get a sword for marco,\u201d Bush wrote to a couple of staffers in October 2005. That\u2019s because Bush, who had become a close political ally of Rubio\u2019s, was to speak at a ceremony dedicating Rubio as the next speaker of the Florida House, and he would award Rubio with a golden sword that symbolized a favorite saying of Bush\u2019s: \u201cUnleash the Chang.\u201d It was mythical reference that Bush frequently used when talking about wanting to push conservative causes. At 62, Bush is one of the older Republicans running for the nomination. But his book attempts to paint him as a governor who was ahead of his time when it came to technology. In his first month in office, he asked his communications director to figure out how to make the state website better, labeling it a \u201chigh priority.\u201d In 2001, he held a town hall in Jacksonville and broadcast it on the Internet, and later his administration partnered up with Yahoo! to help put many of the state\u2019s services online. That same year, Bush writes about how he fell in love for the second time in his life. Someone emailed him about a \u201cminiature remote device called blackberry\u201d and listed all of its new features like the fact that it was \u201cwireless.\u201d The e-book excludes emails from family members, though he did include one from his mom, former first lady Barbara Bush, and one from his dad, former President George H.W. Bush. \u201cWe are in the car going to hear the Oaks75 in Galveston and have a new toy. We love you. Mom,\u201d Barbara wrote in January 2003. Bush could hardly contain his delight, responding with only an expression of glee for her new toy: \u201ca blackberry!!!!\u201d George H.W. Bush sent his son an email a couple of months later, with a dash of his sarcasm. \u201cI love the photo of your swearing in. It is so good of you that I have gotten over my being cropped out by the photographer. Thanks a lot. Love to all, says your devoted, DAD\u201d While the book is drenched in flattering emails from constituents and colleagues, it also includes a few samples of hate mail. In November 1999, one person took issue with Bush signing into law the \u201cChoose Life\u201d specialty license plates that raised money for anti-abortion causes, as well as his support for abstinence-based counseling programs. \u201cIf you have the guts to read your own email, let this sink into you brainless mind - $10 Million to fund your christian (sic) value ideas of sex eduction (sic) is outrageous! You can take that plan, long with your fetus license tags, & any other brainless ideas & STICK IT UP YOUR FAT A\u2013!\u201d Bush quickly replied: \u201cHave a wonderful restful day. You appear to need it.\u201d One man wrote asking the government to intervene in a scuffle with a neighborhood boy who caused $40 in damage on his property with a baseball. The boy\u2019s mom had not reimbursed the man for the damage. \u201cI am totally confused. I don\u2019t understand how a $40 claim is an issue that would make its way up to Tallahassee,\u201d Bush wrote back. In another random email, one person wrote with a simple message: \u201cWe need peace between the farmers, workers and the clergy. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d Bush: \u201cYes.\u201d In December 2006, a 9-year-old girl named Clare wrote to say that she hated going to piano lessons because her instructor \u201csmells of dead aligators\u201d (sic), but her mom told her to ask the governor whether he had taken music lessons as a child. Bush replied: \u201cthank you Clare Jane. yes, I had piano lessons. it was tough and I didn\u2019t enjoy it. In fact, I wasn\u2019t that good at it. But you know what? It gave me discipline which helped me as an adult.\u201d Bush has been spending some of his time lately attacking Rubio for missing votes in the Senate and not fulfilling the duties of his day job. So it was interesting to find an email from someone who accused Bush of spending too much time campaigning for his brother\u2019s 2000 presidential bid. \u201cYou are an employee of the state voted in by people who expect a days work for a days pay,\u201d the constituent wrote. Bush, however, argued that he works \u201cabout 80 hours a week\u201d and campaigns for his brother in his \u201climited spare time,\u201d adding \u201cthe taxpayers won\u2019t pay a penny.\u201d In the narrated portion of the book, Bush said he found out about the Supreme Court decision that cleared the election for his brother on the radio on the way home from Mass. \u201cI then thanked God the ordeal was over and that George would be our next president. Ironically, the day before I had been in Washington, D.C., in the Oval Office with President Clinton for the signing of the Water Resources Development Act,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an awkward moment, given we both were anxious to see whether my brother or his vice president would succeed him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Fiorina's polished debate performance instantly elevated her in the eyes of Republican primary voters But that same debate performance that propelled her in the polls could be one of the factors fueling her decline Carly Fiorina\u2019s brief time in the top ranks of the Republican presidential pack is over \u2013 for now. The former Hewlett-Packard chief executive soared to second place nationwide last month following a breakout performance at CNN\u2019s Republican debate. But a new CNN/ORC poll released on Tuesday found that Fiorina fell to seventh place with support from just 4% of potential Republican primary voters. Fiorina\u2019s polished debate performance \u2013 her takedown of Donald Trump, fluency on foreign policy issues and passionate criticism of Planned Parenthood \u2013 instantly elevated her in the eyes of Republican primary voters who have flocked to Washington outsiders this cycle. But in the weeks since, her campaign has appeared to lose steam. Instead of using her moment in the spotlight to discuss a range of issues and further introduce herself to voters, she instead trained her focus on Planned Parenthood. Top quotes from the Republican debate \u201cThey had this moment and in some ways reduced it by not taking a broader, frankly, more presidential focus,\u201d said Rob Stutzman, a California-based Republican strategist. \u201cThey weren\u2019t prepared for the moment they fought so hard for.\u201d One of the most powerful moments of the GOP debate came when Fiorina referred to one of the undercover Planned Parenthood videos that was shot and edited by an anit-abortion group. \u201cI dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain,\u201d she said. Even after fact-checkers concluded the video footage Fiorina described did not exist, she doubled down on her claims in the days following the debate. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the footage. And I find it amazing, actually, that all these supposed fact-checkers in the mainstream media claim this doesn\u2019t exist. They\u2019re trying to attack the authenticity of the videotape,\u201d Fiorina told Fox News. \u201cI will continue to dare anyone who wants to continue to fund Planned Parenthood, watch the videotapes.\u201d Carly Fiorina's political career Fiorina\u2019s campaign dismissed the notion that her candidacy may be stalling and the candidate has pointed to early state polls \u2013 which show her jockeying for third or fourth place in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina \u2013 as a sign she has momentum. Her fundraising has improved dramatically. Last quarter, Fiorina raised $6.8 million \u2013 a wide improvement from the $1.7 million she raised the previous quarter \u2013 and a larger sum than many of her Republican opponents. \u201cWe\u2019re really happy with the way things are going,\u201d said Anna Epstein, a campaign spokeswoman, adding that voters are still in the process of getting to know Fiorina. \u201cWe\u2019re still introducing her to as many people as we can. That\u2019s definitely not over.\u201d Fiorina outraises Rubio, Paul in 3rd quarter Cullen, the former New Hampshire party chair, said a dip in the national polls wasn\u2019t anything for the candidate to be concerned about. \u201cLook, she was an asterisk nine months ago,\u201d Cullen said. \u201cYou have to zoom out a little bit more and say that Carly has been advancing for nine consecutive months. That\u2019s just what you want to do.\u201d But at the first sign Fiorina was on the rise, the candidate faced an onslaught of scrutiny over her rocky tenure as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard and her unsuccessful California Senate bid in 2010. Her campaign and the super PAC supporting her \u2013 which has shouldered the responsibility for hosting events and organizing on the ground game \u2013 have struggled to craft a counter narrative to the criticism. When asked whether the stories about her HP tenure and her Senate race were damaging Fiorina, Epstein said, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to say about that right now.\u201d Katie Hughes, a spokeswoman for the super PAC supporting Fiorina, said, \u201cCarly has a very successful record at HP and we\u2019re thankful for the opportunity to promote it.\u201d But that record ultimately crippled her Senate bid. And while attacks on a candidate\u2019s business record tend to be more effective in a general election than in a Republican primary, Fiorina will have to make her case to voters even as the cornerstone of her resume is under fire. \u201cDonald Trump has shown such a willingness to go after her on her business experiences, which is why she needs to make it more of a character question,\u201d said Amanda Carpenter, a GOP strategist and former communications director for Sen. Ted Cruz. Carpenter\u2019s advice: Fiorina should be blunt in contrasting her substantive style with Trump\u2019s inclination toward insults and attacks. \u201cThe more she can contrast that, saying I\u2019m giving you substance, trust me, I am the better person against Donald Trump, she\u2019ll do well,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cShe\u2019s probably the most capable debater on that stage, in terms of going into a high-stakes environment and blowing out expectations.\u201d Once again, Fiorina\u2019s best opportunity may be when Republicans face off on the debate stage again on October 28. \u201cI am looking forward to the debate because it is an opportunity, once again, for me to introduce myself to that 40% of people who don\u2019t know anything about me,\u201d Fiorina told reporters while she campaigned across Iowa on Friday.",

Bernie Sanders is staking out ground to Hillary Clinton\u2019s left, but he said Thursday he\u2019s also winning over support from Republicans who identify with his impassioned criticism of income inequality. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised there are more than a few Republicans for Bernie Sanders out there. Don\u2019t be surprised if we do well with a number of Republicans,\u201d Sanders said on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d Sanders, a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist, has been plagued by doubts about his general election viability since launching his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. But Sanders said his message is resonating with \u201cworking-class Republicans\u201d who face the same struggles that his campaign platform is so directly targeting. \u201cYou know Republicans have to send their kids to college. Working-class Republicans can\u2019t afford to do that. Working-class Republicans have seen their factories shut down and moved to China.

            "article_content": "The Planned Parenthood showdown rocking Washington is much more than just another skirmish in the never-ending abortion wars. It\u2019s a struggle that could define political power, on a key social issue that both parties have long used to motivate their most committed voters, for years to come. For now, Democrats and Republicans are drawing battle lines over whether a government funding package should allow millions of federal dollars to flow to the organization \u2013 a fight will play out on Capitol Hill into December. But the larger battle is for the women\u2019s vote, which will be crucial to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Planned Parenthood: Fast facts and revealing numbers \u201cMake no mistake: despite what we hear, Republicans are doubling down on their war against women,\u201d said New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney on Tuesday, at a congressional hearing at which Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards endured an uncomfortable five-hour grilling. \u201cWe need to recognize this fight for what it is \u2013 it\u2019s about banning a woman\u2019s right to choose.\u201d Republicans, including presidential candidates Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina, have seized on videos released this summer which purportedly show Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue, seeking to seize on grassroots conservative revulsion and to put potential Democratic rivals on the defensive. Many Republicans are sincerely motivated by a deep commitment to oppose abortion, which offends their morals and in some case their religious beliefs. But there are also sound political reasons to go after the group \u2013 using the edited videos as a tool. Republicans have repeatedly attempted to wound the organization, partly because Planned Parenthood and its supporters lie at the center of the extended Democratic Party political machine. \u201cIt is an organization that has been around for a long time, in terms of institutional clout and power and influence,\u201d said Kelly Dittmar, a professor of political science at the Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics. \u201cI think the organization itself has proven itself to be a very astute and strong political power, both in mobilizing women voters and young women voters and also in funding candidates.\u201d Opinion: Planned Parenthood video an ugly mirror for America Some Planned Parenthood critics bemoan its political and symbolic weight and dismiss the group\u2019s argument that it is primarily a vehicle for improving women\u2019s health care, often for those in dire economic straits who cannot get good care elsewhere. \u201cTheir impact is in elections,\u201d said Kristen Day, executive director of Democrats for Life, which supports the defunding of Planned Parenthood and supports Democrats who also oppose abortion. \u201cThey have the money that they put into elections, into electing Democratic candidates. If you separate the women\u2019s health issue from elections, Democrats would make very different decisions.\u201d She added: \u201cInstead of protecting one corporation that heavily finances Democratic candidates, they would focus on how to increase funding for healthcare for women.\u201d READ: Planned Parenthood executive slams GOP questioning Denting Planned Parenthood would represent a victory for the GOP as it girds for new Democratic accusations that it is bent on stripping away women\u2019s health benefits, which have proven a potent electoral device in the past. At Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Richards argued before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee that Planned Parenthood gets most of its funding under Medicaid for health services like contraception and screenings for conditions like sexually transmitted disease and cancer. But Committee Chairman Rep. Jason Chaffetz, in an impassioned attack, billed Planned Parenthood as a political organization with huge salaries that did not need federal funding. \u201cThis has absolutely nothing to do with providing health care to young women who need a breast exam,\u201d Chaffetz said. Democrats feel that defending Planned Parenthood can be a political winner and has helped them ostracize Republicans among the crucial demographic of women voters that has opened a gender gap that has helped resolve previous elections in their favor. In 2012, Obama used his GOP opponent Mitt Romney\u2019s opposition to funding Planned Parenthood to drive home a wider attack that he would not only discriminate against women but was also aloof from the struggles of the Middle Class. Obama said that Planned Parenthood services were not only important for women\u2019s health but were an economic question. \u201cThat\u2019s a pocket book issue for women and families all across the country,\u201d Obama said at a presidential debate. Democrats, including front runner Hillary Clinton, who is playing the gender card in a far more flagrant way than she did in her 2008 campaign, has called GOP allegations against the group \u201ctroubling\u201d \u2013 in the process turning the group into a 2016 issue. \u201cThis is really an attack on Planned Parenthood, which provides a lot of health servies, from cancer screenings, to contraceptive services, to so many other of the needs women have,\u201d Clinton said on CBS show \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on September 20. READ: Planned Parenthood president grilled at House hearing The battle over Planned Parenthood also represents an attempt by Republicans to strike at the Democratic Party\u2019s political machinery itself, on an issue \u2013 abortion \u2013 that both sides have organized multiple elections around and rely on to motivate base voters in close elections. \u201cSo much of the (Republican) agenda revolves around trying to control women\u2019s bodies,\u201d said Josh Nelson, spokesman for Credo, an activist organization that supports progressive issues. \u201cI think if it it wasn\u2019t Planned Parenthood, Republicans would find a different way to do that and there would be a different symbol \u2013 they have decided to make it Planned Parenthood.\u201d In the 2014 electoral cycle, Planned Parenthood spent just under $1.6 million in contributions to political candidates, party committees and PACS and a little more in lobbying, according to OpenSecrets.org, which charts the role of money in politics. The group, and other pro-choice organizations, also exert strong political pressure on Democrats, beyond funding, said Charles Camosy, a Fordham University professor who argues that both sides use Planned Parenthood as a wedge issue to motivate their most enthusiastic base voters. Some Democrats dread the \u201cprospect of being primaried, the prospect of being persona non grata with the Democratic leadership. There is a lot of power there,\u201d said Camosy, author of a book called \u201cBeyond the Abortion Wars.\u201d As an example of the political pressure lawmakers who do not toe the party line could face, Credo is campaigning to convince the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee not to fund any party lawmakers who vote to defund Planned Parenthood. \u201cWe are glad to hold accountable any politician who is on the wrong side of this issue,\u201d said Nelson.",

The former Hewlett-Packard executive, who has surged into the top tier of 2016 Republican presidential candidates, accused Democrats of protecting a political ally Sunday in an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cThis is about a political slush fund. It is about the character of our nation,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yes, we should stand up and fight on this issue.\u201d Fiorina has lashed out at Planned Parenthood in recent weeks, specifically citing controversial abortion-related videos that Republicans are using as rationale to block any federal dollars from flowing to the group. The women\u2019s health organization has pushed back, asserting the videos are misleading and insist they have done nothing wrong. On Saturday, Planned Parenthood supporters threw condoms in Fiorina\u2019s direction during an evening event in Iowa. \u201cIf (Democrats) are willing to stand up and defend this practice and shut down the government over it, then let them explain it to the American people. Let them explain it,\u201d Fiorina said. Pressed on whether she supports shutting the government down over the issue as Congress approaches an end-of-September deadline to extend federal funding, Fiorina said: \u201cI believe there are a variety of ways to deal with this, but I believe this is something we must stand up and fight for because it is about the character of our nation.\u201d \u201cTaxpayers are funding this activity. And not only that, not only are taxpayers having to fund this butchery, but Planned Parenthood doles out millions of dollars every single election cycle to Democratic candidates,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "The campaign arm for Senate Democrats is targeting nine Republicans up for re-election with a five-figure ad buy because they think that the incumbents are vulnerable on the issue of defunding Planned Parenthood, CNN has learned. The ads ask whether the senators \u2013 eight of whom voted last month to block federal funds to the organization because it performs abortions \u2013 were willing to back calls from the right flank of the GOP to shut down the government over the issue. Several of the senators are moderate and most come from states that have a history of electing both Republicans and Democrats. Republicans currently hold 54 Senate seats and Democrats 46. But in their campaign to hold the Senate, Republicans must defend 24 open seats while Democrats have to protect just 10. The issue of defunding Planned Parenthood took on new urgency after undercover, heavily edited videos from anti-abortion rights activists appeared to show Planned Parenthood workers discussing the sale of fetal tissue from abortions for scientific research. A CNN poll released last week shows why Democrats think the issue will resonate. The poll found that 71% of all responders believe it\u2019s more important to fund the government that to strip federal funds from Planned Parenthood. Importantly, for anyone running an election in a highly competitive state, 74% of independent voters say the government should not be shut down over the issue. Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania is a main target of the ads because Democrats believe they have a good chance to knock off the Republican who is seeking  a second term. Democrats suggest Toomey and other targeted Republicans might \u201cflip flop\u201d on the issue to placate swing voters in their states. \u201cAs a potential shutdown creeps closer, we will see if Sen. Toomey sticks with his votes to defund Planned Parenthood or if he is so scared about his re-election that he flip-flops in a panic,\u201d said Sadie Weiner, spokeswoman for Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, in a statement. \u201cThese ads will highlight that Sen. Toomey and extremists in Congress are playing a dangerous game, and Pennsylvania families deserve better.\u201d Toomey\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment about the ad. Other senators who are the focus of the ads, which will appear of Facebook and Twitter, are Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois and Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire. Ayotte has already stated she is wary of shuttering the government over the funding fight because right now opponents of Planned Parenthood don\u2019t have the votes to be successful. Ayotte wrote a letter last week to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a presidential candidate, who is advocating for the Congress to close the government if it can\u2019t block federal dollars to Planned Parenthood. In it, she questioned the wisdom of such a move since the vote last month to defund the organization got only 53 votes, seven votes shy of what is needed to pass a bill in the Senate and 14 votes shy of the votes needed to override a promised presidential veto of that legislation. \u201cGiven the challenges and threats we face at home and abroad, I oppose risking a government shutdown, particularly when it appears there is no chance of achieving a successful result,\u201d Ayotte\u2019s letter said. Ayotte\u2019s office reiterated that she opposes a shutdown Monday. \u201cAs a leader who was widely credited with helping bring both parties together to end the last government shutdown, Senator Ayotte strongly opposes shutting down the government and she is fighting against this flawed strategy,\u201d said Ayotte spokeswoman Liz Johnson in a statement. The campaign manager for Portman also said the senator was working to avoid a shut down. \u201cRob has said repeatedly, he will continue to be strongly supportive of defunding Planned Parenthood but he doesn\u2019t support government shutdowns and thinks it can be avoided,\u201d said Corry Bliss. Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is working to fund the government, called the effort to defund the organization futile. Kirk is the only senator who is a target of the DSCC ad who did not vote for the Planned Parenthood defunding bill last month. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the GOP won't succeed in trying to defund Planned Parenthood at this time \"I think if you lose before you start fighting -- that's not the best or the most desired position from my perspective,\" says Sen. Tim Scott Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes it\u2019s an \u201cexercise in futility\u201d to try and defund Planned Parenthood this month. Not all of his Senate Republican colleagues agree. In interviews with CNN, a number of Republicans want to at least put up a fight in the Senate to show their conservative base that they are trying to strip funding for the organization, which performs abortions and other health-care services to millions of women. \u201cI have lost many votes in my time,\u201d said Sen. Tim Scott, a conservative from South Carolina. \u201cI would rather vote for what I think is right for the American people, making the right decisions, and ultimately if you lose, you lose.\u201d He added: \u201cI think if you lose before you start fighting \u2013 that\u2019s not the best or the most desired position from my perspective.\u201d Scott\u2019s comments come as congressional Republicans are stuck in a tactical dispute over whether to use a must-pass funding bill to try to gut the organization, which receives more than $500 million annually in government funding. In light of controversial and highly edited videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of aborted fetal parts, conservatives have sought to use the Sept. 30 fiscal deadline to force through a government-wide spending bill that eliminates the group\u2019s federal funding. But with President Barack Obama vowing to veto such a measure, and Democrats in the Senate holding enough votes to filibuster it, Senate Republican leaders are worried that such a move would prompt a government shutdown and sharp backlash from voters. In an interview with CNN last week, McConnell said the tactic \u2013 championed by conservative Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 would be fruitless. \u201cYou could shut down the government and that will not defund Planned Parenthood,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cSo that is a strategy that will not lead to a result that I would like. Shutting down the government is something the American people overwhelmingly oppose, and we will not be doing that.\u201d He added that seeking to defund the organization through a must-pass funding bill \u201cwouldn\u2019t produce the result that Sen. Cruz and I would both like to produce. So therefore, it would be an exercise in futility.\u201d READ: McConnell aims to split abortion from shutdown debate But few of McConnell\u2019s own Senate Republican colleagues are willing to go that far, hoping not to upset the right-flank of their party. \u201cI think a better way of saying that is: \u2018It\u2019s a difficult challenge but a worthwhile cause,\u201d said Sen. Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, who is up for re-election next year. \u201cI would not walk away from all options related to funding.\u201d Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, a member of GOP leadership who also faces voters next year in his conservative state, said it makes sense to try to push a provision in a spending bill to defund Planned Parenthood on the Senate floor, even if there\u2019s little chance of success. \u201cSometimes, you have to go through an exercise in futility a time or two to truly prove it is an exercise in futility,\u201d Blunt said. But Blunt cautioned: \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t want to do is change the topic here from focusing on the conduct of Planned Parenthood to focusing on a shutdown \u2026 If we made a strategic mistake here, it would be changing the topic.\u201d Still, Republican leaders are grappling with how to alleviate demands from their rank-and-file \u2013 particularly in the House. Senior GOP aides say the leadership has yet to settle in on its strategy just yet, so they planned an unusual Wednesday night all-GOP conference meeting to discuss next steps on the funding bill, according to a senior House Republican leadership aide. The meeting follows a series of \u201clistening sessions\u201d that top House Republican leaders held with rank-and-file members to come up with a legislative strategy around the spending bill and the push to defund Planned Parenthood. But conservatives are adding pressure to House Speaker John Boehner to take a hardline on the issue. The conservative Republican Study Committee released its wishlist Tuesday, calling for the organization to lose its federal funding. And leaders of the House Freedom Caucus, led by South Carolina Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney, are circulating a letter urging the GOP to reject any bill that continues funding for Planned Parenthood. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-California, already announced last week that his chamber would vote at the end of this week on a stand-alone bill to bar taxpayer money for Planned Parenthood for a year, while Congress continues investigations. Separately, the House will also vote this week on a bill to impose penalties on medical professionals who fail to provide care for a baby who survives an abortion procedure. READ: Boehner sidesteps on shutdown talk The larger idea is to separate the anti-abortion fight from the spending bill. As part of that effort, Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, issued a subpoena Wednesday seeking all unedited videos taped by the Center for Medical Progress, the conservative group that secretly taped Planned Parenthood discussions. (Planned Parenthood contends that the videos were doctored and that the group did nothing illegal.) In the Senate, three GOP-led committees are investigating Planned Parenthood. And McConnell plans to move on a bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks as soon as this week \u2013 a measure that would not be linked to government funding. The most likely scenario: The House passes a government-spending bill that would also defund Planned Parenthood, which would later fail in the Senate. The Senate would then strip out the Planned Parenthood provision and send it back to the House. But there are fewer than nine legislative days left before government funding dries up \u2013 and any senator can throw up procedural roadblocks to block the chamber from proceeding. So McConnell and Boehner may have no other choice but to let their chambers vote on a \u201cclean\u201d stop-gap bill that funds the government until December \u2013 and continues funding for Planned Parenthood in the meantime. No final decisions have been made. \u201cOur members have a lot of ideas on how to proceed and the conference is still discussing them,\u201d said Don Stewart, a McConnell spokesman. McConnell\u2019s chief deputy, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, said in an interview Tuesday that the best idea is to vote separately on anti-abortion bills and take the debate to voters and wait until the next president to battle on the issue. Shutting down the government, he said, would set back the anti-abortion movement. \u201cThis is the way we made progress of the years,\u201d Cornyn said. \u201cBy having these kinds of votes, differentiating between people who are pro-life and people who are not. And I think we\u2019ve done a lot to advance the pro-life agenda. So this is not just something we\u2019re going to do over the next two weeks.\u201d Still, not everyone agrees. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Blunt, the Missouri Republican, when asked if he thought the funding fight could set back the anti-abortion effort. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re badly positioned here in terms of what we\u2019re doing on the debate of Planned Parenthood and abortion.\u201d CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "The Christian leadership of an anti-abortion nonprofit is playing an emerging role in the super PACs backing Ted Cruz The leaders of Online for Life have formed a new company that is effectively serving as a highly-touted data and digital operation for the independent groups The Christian leadership of an anti-abortion nonprofit is playing a growing role in the super PACs backing Ted Cruz as the groups go through a major shake-up, CNN has learned. The leaders of Online for Life, a Texas-based group that tries to convince women not to follow through with abortions, have formed a new organization that is effectively serving as a data and digital operation for the independent groups. Four top officials from the group, who have very limited campaign experience and are led by president Brian Fisher, launched Red Metrics LLC as part of a highly-touted Cruz strategy to organize evangelicals on social media, state and election records show. The move by Cruz allies is the latest shift in the strategy of the Keep the Promise super PACs to win over social conservatives that are key to the Cruz coalition. Top Cruz super PAC donors and operatives \u2013 including those from Online for Life \u2013 met Wednesday night in New York to chart the next steps for the groups, which includes hosting fundraisers for Cruz and list-sharing with the Houston-based campaign. Online for Life is praised by social conservatives for using apps and social media to link up women seeking to end a pregnancy with persuasive anti-abortion advocates. And the group\u2019s involvement in a political campaign reveals the technology and Christian messages likely to be employed by the Cruz outside spending machine, which so far has shed little light about how it plans to spend its largely untapped fortune. The big-dollar Cruz groups this week also sent word that their top fundraiser and strategist, energy investor Toby Neugebauer, who was effectively running the super PAC day-to-day, would be replaced by a Texas leader with deep ties to the nation\u2019s most influential pastors, David Barton, a transition first reported by Bloomberg. Cruz spoke to a group of pastors that Barton organized on Wednesday afternoon in Washington, according to a tweet from Barton. READ: First on CNN: Cruz super PAC\u2019s plan to win presidency Together, the developments hint that the four separate pro-Cruz groups are not proceeding as steadily as the super PAC\u2019s cash totals suggest. Defenders of the super PAC maintain that the move by Neugebauer, who gave $10 million to the Keep the Promise super PAC and helped bring in the other two major families who similarly cut eight-figure checks, will not affect the group\u2019s operations. But his departure raises fresh questions about how effectively the Cruz groups \u2013 who only recently hired their first professional political operatives \u2013 plan to spend their surprisingly large war chest. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new direction at all,\u201d said Kellyanne Conway, a GOP pollster and top official at the super PACs, saying it made \u201cperfect sense\u201d to hire Barton given that \u201cmany of those prospective donors are people of faith and or folks who are Texans.\u201d Moments from Ted Cruz's career Keep the Promise is technically four separate, affiliated super PACs that are organized to give three families, including Neugebauer\u2019s, more direct control of their spending. The arrangement \u2013 heralded by some campaign lawyers as innovative and by others as unusual \u2013 comes after some Republican donors felt their money was mismanaged by independent groups in previous election cycles. But it is also allowing donors to hire their own operatives: the Wilks family of Texas, which runs and gave $15 million to the Cruz group Keep the Promise III, is one of the largest funders of Online for Life. People familiar with the super PAC say the family is impressed with the work Online for Life does. Farris and Dan Wilks are also very close with Barton, sources say. READ: First on CNN: Billionaire brothers give Cruz super PAC $15 million \u201cThey do their work through a decidedly non-political and apolitclal lens,\u201d Conway said, praising them as data-driven operatives who know how exactly how many women they\u2019ve steered away from abortions. \u201cThey\u2019ve got this distinctive brand in the marketplace in that they can point to tangible and true metrics of success.\u201d Fisher and other leaders of Online for Life did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Each group has its own political hands: The family of Bob Mercer, one of the biggest Republican donors in the country, is bankrolling Keep the Promise I, run by Conway, which has focused on paid media. And Neugebauer\u2019s group, Keep the Promise II, will now be run by Barton. The three affiliated groups are expected to transfer money to the main, forward-facing group, Keep the Promise PAC, when it chooses to spend its millions. But so far, that spending has been far and few between. The groups are only making their first advertising buys, and they reported on the last campaign-finance report mysteriously having spent virtually none of the $38 million they raised. Some outside critics have raised eyebrows at the Cruz super PACs\u2019 meager spending so far, wondering what the group plans to do with its money. This weekend, the Keep the Promise groups will launch a new advertising campaign in Iowa during the state\u2019s big football match up between the University of Iowa and Iowa State University, Conway said. The super PAC revealed in a presentation to donors earlier this summer that they hoped to emphasize wedge issues as part of their campaign, and they also called for greater emphasis on Cruz\u2019s Hispanic heritage. Since then, the super PAC has also made a prominent early-state hire in Iowa. READ: Steve King\u2019s son signs on with Ted Cruz super PAC in Iowa But it\u2019s unclear if those plans will now change with the leadership move. Thomas Patrick, a six-figure donor to the main Keep the Promise PAC, said he didn\u2019t expect turbulence with the shakeup, explaining that he only met Neugebauer after Cruz personally introduced him. \u201cI\u2019m counting on them being real professionals,\u201d Patrick said, adding that many more Cruz donors are still on the sidelines. \u201cHe\u2019s got the ability to raise a lot more. He\u2019s a big league guy.\u201d Cruz\u2019s original lieutenant to the world of Republican megadonors, his close college friend David Panton, has more or less been sidelined in the outside money game as groups tied to Neugebauer rose in prominence, according to people who aren\u2019t authorized to discuss the super PAC\u2019s internal workings. Now, Neugebauer, who lives far from donors in Puerto Rico and who people say did not anticipate the amount of work required to run a super PAC, is scaling back his involvement in the Cruz groups, though he is not expected to revoke any of his large cash infusion. The Cruz campaign is increasingly working with the super PAC, which cannot coordinate expenditures with the official headquarters. Cruz will attend a large fundraiser hosted by Keep the Promise in New York on Sept. 21, organizers said. Cruz is also wooing some of the large Republican donors who have not yet committed to his groups, like Darwin Deason, who is a major donor to Rick Perry\u2019s groups, and Tommy Hicks Jr., a Texas businessman who sits at the center of a powerful political family. Keep the Promise PAC, Conway said, has executed an email list swap with the official campaign, and a person familiar with the deal said Keep the Promise III has as well, giving the Cruz campaign a vast list of emails that the campaign can target. The Online for Life operatives, which have already built a Facebook page called \u201cReigniting the Promise\u201d with more than 200,000 followers in about two months\u2019 time, are expected to transfer over a list of emails to the Cruz campaign full of Christians who may have not been involved in politics that the campaign will now engage. \u201cThey obviously are already experts in social media, so for them to transfer followers on social media is probably easy breeze for them,\u201d Conway said. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated which of the pro-Cruz PACs that Conway said have plans to execute email list swaps with the official campaign. Conway only said the Keep the Promise PAC has plans to do so.",

            "article_content": "The verbal sparring between Donald Trump and Ben Carson isn\u2019t the typical feud between two top-tier presidential candidates. It\u2019s a heated battle for the evangelical voters who could help decide the next Republican contender for the White House. Trump and Carson are both gunning hard for the white evangelicals who dominate the early contest states of Iowa and South Carolina. And their exchange over faith and personal beliefs this week could ultimately expose substantial vulnerabilities for both men, highlighting the evolution of their beliefs over the past few decades. One of the most striking findings in CNN\u2019s new poll this week was the close contest between Trump and Carson among white evangelical voters. As Carson gains, he is threatening to overtake Trump with that key voting bloc, notching the support of 28% of white evangelical voters to Trump\u2019s 32% in the CNN/ORC poll released Thursday. \u201cRight now, Carson sees Trump as an obstacle to his winning Iowa. He\u2019s built a strong following among some evangelicals in Iowa and sees a chance to build on that by taking on Trump,\u201d said Republican strategist Kevin Madden, who worked for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cThe moves by Carson and (Louisiana Gov. Bobby) Jindal to take a more direct approach signals that they see Trump\u2019s appeal to these voters as a con, and a fraud. This is a push to expose Trump with values voters they need to come their way if they\u2019re going to win in Iowa.\u201d READ: Donald Trump: Debating Clinton \u2018would be one of the easy challenges of my life\u2019 Trump previously said he would not go after Carson because the retired John Hopkins neurosurgeon was a \u201cgood guy.\u201d But the real estate magnate clearly took personal umbrage at Carson\u2019s assertion to reporters in Anaheim on Wednesday that the main difference between them was that he did not \u201cin any way deny my faith in God.\u201d Carson and his campaign aides claimed on Thursday that the doctor had not meant to make a personal attack on Trump. But it was a sharp pivot for the usually genial candidate, and a politically savvy strategy \u2013 aimed squarely at getting evangelical voters in those key primary states to focus on Trump\u2019s past support for abortion, his multiple marriages and his knowledge of the Bible. Trump told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo Thursday that Carson had no knowledge of his beliefs: \u201cWho is he to question my faith?\u2026 He doesn\u2019t even know me,\u201d said Trump, adding that he was \u201ca believer \u2013 big league \u2013 in God and the Bible.\u201d Trump also said that his examination of Carson\u2019s past showed \u201che wasn\u2019t a big man of faith.\u201d \u201cAll of a sudden, he\u2019s becoming this man of faith and he was heavy into the world of abortion,\u201d Trump said. He added that Carson, the first surgeon to separate conjoined twins, was an \u201cOK doctor\u201d with once \u201chorrendous\u201d views on abortion \u2013 an apparent reference to Carson\u2019s medical research in the early 1990s on tissue from aborted fetuses. Carson\u2019s business manager Armstrong Williams parried back on Thursday that the retired neurosurgeon\u2019s remarks on Trump\u2019s faith had been misinterpreted\u2014and that Carson, who will tour Ferguson, Missouri, on Friday, was merely talking about his own \u201cfaith in God, his humility and what drives him.\u201d But Williams also said on CNN that Trump was acting \u201calmost like a schoolyard bully \u2014 that if you say something I don\u2019t like, that I\u2019m going to come after you and everything is on the table.\u201d Carson, for his part, told The Washington Post, that he wasn\u2019t looking to get into a \u201cgladiator fight\u201d with Trump. It may indeed end up being a battle between the two men for evangelical voters, who are among the most organized participants in the Iowa Caucuses. Unlike white Protestants and Catholics, the political muscle of white evangelicals has only increased in recent election cycles \u2013 forcing more moderate Republican candidates into a box on social issues like abortion and gay marriage if they want to clear the primary circuit. READ: Carson pulls punches as Trump pounces The Pew Forum has found that while the white Protestant and white Catholic share of the electorate has declined since 2000, white evangelicals \u2013 who reliably favor Republicans \u2013 have held steady, comprising nearly a quarter of the electorate in 2012. Even more significant, Pew found they made up 32% of the electorate in Iowa in 2012, which was a jump from the 2008 and 2004 election cycles. Before Carson questioned the authenticity of Trump\u2019s faith on Wednesday, most of the attacks on Trump had been policy based. Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush has repeatedly blasted Trump as not being conservative \u2014 releasing an Instagram video showing him talking about his once \u201cpro-choice\u201d views. Carson\u2019s foray into the faith conversation this week took the debate in a more personal direction, but Craig Robinson, the former political director of the Republican Party of Iowa, said it may bring unwelcome attention to Carson\u2019s fetal medical research, as well as his position on Kentucky clerk Kim Davis, which he said did not go far enough for evangelicals. \u201cCandidates either speak the same language as evangelical voters or they don\u2019t \u2013 and caucus voters tend to have a way to figure that out over time,\u201d said Robinson, founder and editor-in-chief of The Iowa Republican website. He predicted that evangelical voters would abandon Trump, in part because they don\u2019t know much about his past statements about abortion yet \u2013 and have yet to see them over and over again in paid television ads. \u201cWe are still in the stage of discovery for voters\u2026 People are still kicking the tires. They like what they see, but they really haven\u2019t done the research,\u201d Robinson said. With Carson, Robinson said, \u201cultimately I don\u2019t think he satisfies those socially conservative voters either. The issue with the research that he\u2019s done on aborted babies \u2013 when that is more well known and talked about \u2013 it\u2019s going to be more of a deal breaker.\u201d Carson has defended his research, saying \u201cthe issue of fetal tissue has everything to do with how the tissue is acquired.\u201d \u201cKilling babies and harvesting tissue for sale is very different than taking a dead specimen and keeping a record of it, which is exactly the source of the tissue used in our research,\u201d he said in August. Evangelicals may end up feeling more comfortable with longtime standbys like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee or even former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who won the 2012 Iowa Caucuses. \u201cOver time they always tend to drift back to their natural harbor \u2013 candidates who are with them on the issues and speak, and even think, like they do,\u201d Robinson said. READ: Ben Carson offers cure for Carson \u2018Fever\u2019: $25 T-Shirts But Carson has cleared the way for a new line of attack on Trump. Jindal tried to edge into the conversation Thursday by echoing Carson\u2019s line with more direct language. \u201cDonald Trump is for Donald Trump.  He believes in nothing other than himself,\u201d Jindal said in an appearance at the National Press Club in Washington, where he said Trump was an egomaniac and a narcissist. Trump delivered perhaps the ultimate insult by refusing to respond: \u201cI only respond to people that register more than 1% in the polls,\u201d he said in a statement.

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court isn\u2019t usually a hot topic in the early days of a presidential campaign. But the 2016 election will be different. By the time the next president strides into the Oval Office, three of the Court\u2019s nine justices will be in their 80s. The stakes are high as the country is still digesting one of the most historic terms in recent history, which included blockbuster cases on Obamacare and same-sex marriage. Future justices could potentially face cases on everything from campaign finance, affirmative action, abortion and voting rights. And, mindful that ideological shifts can occur once a justice takes the bench, Court watchers want to be sure presidential candidates are as prepared as possible. For their part, judicial conservatives \u2013 stung by some nominees such as David Souter who ultimately disappointed them \u2013 want a plan. They want to know more about a presidential hopeful\u2019s intentions when it comes to the appointment of judges. \u201cWe have had seven Supreme Court appointments in the past 20 years of Republican presidential administrations. But we nevertheless do not have a Court that consistently adheres to the principles of limited, constitutional government,\u201d said Leonard Leo who served as a key adviser and coalitions leader to the George W. Bush administration on judicial selection and U.S. Supreme Court appointments. \u201cOpinion and political leaders need to press Republican primary candidates about what they will do differently than previous GOP presidents.\u201d Conservatives seized on recent comments Donald Trump made about the Court in an interview with Bloomberg News. He offered praise for Justice Clarence Thomas, and blasted Chief Justice John Roberts for voting to uphold key a key provision of the health care law. But it\u2019s what Trump said about his own sister that surprised some in conservative circles. He was asked if he would ever consider appointing Maryanne Trump Barry, who is a federal judge, for a seat on the Court. \u201cShe would be phenomenal,\u201d he responded. He was quick to add with a smile: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to rule that out at least temporarily.\u201d READ: Supreme Court asked to review Texas abortion ruling Ramesh Ponnuru, of the National Review, pounced on the comments the next day, calling Barry a \u201cpro-abortion extremist judge.\u201d For conservatives, one of the biggest mistakes a president can make is to nominate someone without insisting that the candidate have a strong record. Leo says conservative activists want to know whether candidates will nominate people \u201cwho have a demonstrated record of applying the Constitution as it is written and enforcing the limits on government power.\u201d The memory of the Souter nomination is still fresh. President George H.W. Bush nominated Souter in 1990, based in part on the recommendations of his staff. Souter became a consistent vote for the liberals, eventually stepping down in 2009 and giving President Barack Obama the chance at a nominee. Similarly, George W. Bush was accused of relying too much on his friendship with Harriet Miers when he nominated her to the bench in 2005. The nomination fell apart soon after, largely torpedoed by conservative fears that she had no established judicial record. In recent comments, Jeb Bush seemed sympathetic to those concerns. \u201cOne of the frustrations that I had is that people that don\u2019t have a proven record get appointed to the Court and then they wander,\u201d Bush said while never mentioning the role his father and brother played in recent Supreme Court nominations. Bush talked strategy, emphasizing that a president might have to be ready for a \u201cbig huge fight\u201d on the Hill to push through a desired candidate. \u201cYou got to fight like hell to make sure they get passed,\u201d he said. Leo and others are well aware that even the most closely vetted judicial candidates can sometimes issue unexpected opinions once they take the bench. Lee Epstein, a political science professor at Washington University School of Law, discusses what she calls the \u201cideological drift\u201d of some justices in her book, \u201cThe Behavior of Federal Judges.\u201d \u201cA Justice\u2019s ideology might change during his time on the Court,\u201d she and her co-authors, William M. Landes and Richard A. Posner, write. \u201cThat is true of other people, why not of Supreme Court justices?\u201d Epstein says that since 1937 the \u201cdrift hypothesis\u201d is supported for 12 of the 23 Justices who served a minimum of 15 terms. Eight of those became more liberal and four became more conservative. What causes the drift? Epstein says it\u2019s hard to tell but mentions one factor might be \u201cthe tendency for the gap between the ideology of a justice and the ideology of the President who appointed (the justice) to widen with the length of the Justice\u2019s service.\u201d READ: Poll: Donald Trump surges to 32% support That suggests a trade-off. A president may favor appointing justices of younger age so that long after the end of his or her administration, that justice would continue that president\u2019s legacy. But the \u201cdrift hypothesis\u201d suggests that a president might not just look at age, but do more to make sure that a candidate has a solid judicial record. \u201cA judge\u2019s performance on the Court of Appeals will provide better evidence of his ideological commitments than experience as a practicing lawyer,\u201d the authors write. It\u2019s little wonder that eight of the nine current sitting judges served as lower court judges. For their part, liberals seem to have only one major complaint about the nominees recent Democratic presidents have put on the court: There are only four of them. Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton has not been shy about targeting at least one major decision she\u2019d like to see overturned. \u201cI think the Supreme Court made a grave error with its Citizens United decision,\u201d Clinton said during an appearance in Iowa. \u201cI will do everything I can to appoint Supreme Court justices who will protect the right to vote and not the right of billionaires to buy elections.\u201d But the notion of a presidential candidate suggesting a litmus test for a Supreme Court nominee does not sit well with everyone. Critics of Clinton\u2019s comments included retired Justice John Paul Stevens, who wrote the stinging dissent in Citizens United and was nominated to the bench by Gerald Ford. \u201cIf I were running for president, I don\u2019t think I would make such a litmus test,\u201d he said during a talk in May hosted by the liberal leaning Alliance for Justice. \u201cEven though I think the case ought to be overruled, no doubt about that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ben Carson and Donald Trump have identified with Democrats in the past That history isn't hurting them as they lead the polls for the GOP presidential nomination Here\u2019s how topsy-turvy the Republican presidential race is becoming: The two candidates on top of the field are former Democrats. The front-runner, Donald Trump, has already had to explain his past support for abortion and to deny he wants to raise taxes on the rich. Ben Carson, meanwhile, admitted on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d last week he was once a \u201cpretty left-wing Democrat.\u201d Dr. Ben Carson on State of the Union: Full Interview Despite that liberal past, which would almost certainly doom any other Republican presidential hopeful, Trump and Carson are leading polls nationally and in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa. Their success is raising the question of whether the anti-establishment storm rocking the party means that ideological litmus tests set for candidates by conservatives on social and religious issues are less important than in the past. Steve Scheffler, a Republican activist in Iowa, said the most important current factor driving the race is bitter resentment toward the Republican leadership in Washington. \u201cActivists are sick and tired of the go-along, buddy-buddy system, in particular John Boehner and Mitch McConnell and that whole political elite class that seems not to understand why they got elected,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are looking for areas to vent that frustration.\u201d READ: Inside Ben Carson\u2019s quiet surge Such popular fury explains why Trump and Carson, who are not professional politicians but have passionately incited and exploited anger in the heartland, are doing well in the polls. In the latest Monmouth University poll of GOP voters in Iowa released Monday, Trump and Carson were tied at 23%. Another outsider, former busineswoman Carly Fiorina, was third at 10%. They were leading the professional politicians, several of whom have strong conservative credentials, including Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Baptist preacher who won Iowa in 2008. Ben Carson's career in politics Trump and Carson also lead the latest two national polls of the GOP nominating race, in a sign that past flirtations with the Democratic Party are yet to hurt them. But five months before the first votes in the nominating race are cast in the Iowa caucuses, it is too early to write off more traditional political figures, especially those with solid conservative credentials. If the anti-establishment fury were to ease, vulnerabilities and flip-flops by candidates with questionable conservative records could become more important and a candidate\u2019s positions on abortion, the defunding of Planned Parenthood, religious freedom, same-sex marriage and gay rights will come under scrutiny. \u201cThose issues are important to a bloc of voters that are essential to a Republican candidate\u2019s victory,\u201d said Ken Blackwell, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council and a former Ohio secretary of state. \u201cThe real question is not whether evangelicals are interested in Trump. Is he interested in them?  He can\u2019t be if he is not interested in their core issues.\u201d Blackwell warned that until Trump\u2019s true position on social issues becomes clear, \u201cIt\u2019s way too early for any social conservatives or Christian conservatives to endorse or summarily dismiss Mr. Trump or any other candidate.\u201d Trump\u2019s ideological vulnerabilities exploded into the GOP primary race on Tuesday when Jeb Bush rebutted a barrage of attacks from the billionaire. The former Florida governor released a hard-hitting attack ad slamming the front-runner\u2019s conservative credentials, using damning footage of past statements. \u201cI probably identify more as a Democrat,\u201d Trump said, in archive film that also showed him backing Canadian-style state-run health care and praising Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton as a \u201cterrific woman.\u201d Trump defended himself in an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Tuesday, saying that in New York \u2013 a liberal bastion reviled by conservatives \u2013 \u201ceverybody was a Democrat.\u201d He also predicted his background would prompt many voters who don\u2019t traditionally vote Republican to cross over and support the party in a general election. READ: Carson tops Trump among evangelical voters, polls say \u201cI think I will have a lot of Democrats voting for me \u2013 far more than any Republican for the last long period of time,\u201d he said. Carson said his current position on the major social issues of the day like abortion is clear. \u201cIt is up to us, the people, to stand up for what we believe in, and what I believe in is life, and using the talent that God has provided to give life,\u201d said Carson at the annual National Right to Life Convention in July. Trump has an even more explicit vulnerability on abortion. He said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in 1999 that he opposed a ban on partial birth abortion, though he hated the idea of the procedure, reasoning \u201cI just believe in choice.\u201d Trump now says he turned against abortion after seeing a friend decide not to terminate a pregnancy and have a child. He has long said he opposes same-sex marriage, even though he has gay friends. Trump is also alarming some fiscal conservatives by raising the possibility of import tariffs on U.S. firms that manufacture abroad. But in the CNN interview he dismissed the idea he would raise taxes on anyone other than on hedge fund managers, whose income is often taxed at lower rates than traditional wages. \u201cI\u2019m not proposing to raise taxes,\u201d he said. I\u2019m lowering taxes on the middle class and the upper middle class and the moderately wealthy. I said these hedge fund guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars and they are not paying tax.\u201d Trump\u2019s attempt to close the deal with conservatives may ultimately depend on whether activists continue to overlook his past in a desire to embrace his wider anti-Democratic message. That equation will play out especially in early voting states like Iowa, where evangelicals are crucial and ideological purity on social and religious issues is traditionally an important measure of Republican presidential contenders. It may be a more problematic challenge for Trump than Carson. The former pediatric neurosurgeon has worked hard to build credibility on conservative issues on the talk radio circuit and elsewhere; he swept to national prominence by complaining about political correctness and the national debt to President Barack Obama\u2019s face at the National Prayer Breakfast in Washington in 2013. Trump, meanwhile, may be thrown on the defensive for the first time in the campaign by Bush\u2019s ad, which implicitly argues that the former Florida governor and not the real estate magnate is the true conservative in the race. \u201cThis is a pretty clean hit on Trump all wrapped up in an easy way for people to watch and share,\u201d said Craig Robinson, editor-in-chief of the \u201cIowa Republican\u201d news website. \u201cWhile it might not help Jeb Bush much, I do think it starts a narrative where people will start to look back and say, \u2018Who is this guy who is leading the field?\u2019\u201d Of course, there\u2019s precedent for candidates to move to the right \u2013 and succeed. As Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of the Iowa-based social conservative group The Family Leader pointed out, the patron saint of the conservative movement was once a devotee of liberal President Franklin Roosevelt. \u201cOne of our very best presidents, Ronald Reagan, used to be a Democrat,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "The Center for Medical Progress spotlighted a representative of Advanced Bioscience Resources as being able to procure fetal tissue Planned Parenthood has repeatedly denied accusations from the CMP accusing the group of breaking federal laws An anti-abortion group released its ninth video Tuesday accusing a new company of illegally buying parts from aborted fetuses at Planned Parenthood locations. The latest video focuses on Advanced Bioscience Resources, Inc., a biomedical company that works with Planned Parenthood, according to the Center for Medical Progress, an anti-abortion group behind the series of under cover videos. The Center for Medical Progress, which has released multiple videos aimed at Planned Parenthood, spotlighted a representative of Advanced Bioscience Resources as being able to procure fetal tissue. ABR declined to comment when contacted by CNN. Previous videos had focused on the relationship between Planned Parenthood and StemExpress, a company that provides blood, tissue and other specimen to biomedical researchers. RELATED: 6th Planned Parenthood video released Planned Parenthood has repeatedly denied accusations from the CMP accusing the group of breaking federal laws during their abortion procedure. \u201cThe video released today is not about Planned Parenthood. Staff from two independent health care firms that work with medical providers and research institutions appear to discuss their policies and practices. Multiple times in this video, staff from independent health care firms appear to say that Planned Parenthood is not interested in any financial gain and adheres to ethical standards,\u201d said Planned Parenthood Vice President Eric Ferrero on Tuesday. CMP has been accused of breaking laws by filming people undercover without their consent. Anti-abortion group releases fifth Planned Parenthood video \u201cIn the twisted world of baby parts trafficking from Planned Parenthood abortion clinics, there are few unbroken rules,\u201d said David Daleiden, head of CMP. \u201cAfter the serious admissions in Planned Parenthood\u2019s letter to Congress last week, it is imperative for lawmakers and law enforcement to act decisively to determine the full extent of Planned Parenthood and their proxies\u2019 lawbreaking, hold them accountable, and stop the taxpayer funding of these barbaric atrocities against humanity.\u201d Anti-abortion group releases fourth Planned Parenthood video Planned Parenthood sent a letter to Congress last week that included a 10-page forensic report claiming that the CMP videos are so heavily edited that a thorough investigation of what happens in Planned Parenthood clinics is unclear. Lawmakers launched several investigations into both Planned Parenthood and CMP after the release of the videos. Planned Parenthood officials said it is not possible to decipher the words of the Planned Parenthood employee on the most recent tape, Ferrero said. Third Planned Parenthood video released as Senate Republicans seek to end funding \u201cWhile the Planned Parenthood staff member doesn\u2019t appear to say anything improper, it\u2019s also impossible to know what she said, given that this video has been edited, no source footage has been provided, her mouth is obscured, and this group has a history of editing videos to misrepresent facts. Indeed, this group provided different versions of one of her statements this morning in the video captioning, the transcript, and the press release they issued,\u201d Ferrero said. CMP denies that the videos have been edited in a way to manipulate facts. \u201cWe now know from Cecile Richards\u2019 letter that $60 per collected tissue specimen is what will \u2018get a toe in\u2019 to harvest baby parts at Planned Parenthood Pacific Southwest,\u201d Daleiden wrote Monday in a letter to Congress. Second Planned Parenthood video surfaces showing alleged selling of fetal tissue Multiple Republican presidential candidates have called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood following the release of the videos making the issue one of the most high profile among conservative candidates this election.",

            "article_content": "A new poll finds two-thirds of women think Clinton cares about the needs and problems of women, far more than leading GOP candidates Speaking before Democrats in Minneapolis, Clinton dedicated much of her speech to women's issues Hillary Clinton couldn\u2019t have planned it better if she tried. On Thursday, speaking in Ohio, the Democratic front-runner pulled a Donald Trump, using caustic language to describe what she called the \u201cout of touch policies\u201d of her GOP rivals when it comes to women\u2019s issues. \u201cNow, extreme views about women, we expect that from some of the terrorist groups, we expect that from people who don\u2019t want to live in the modern world, but it\u2019s a little hard to take from Republicans who want to be the president of the United States,\u201d Clinton said in Cleveland. \u201cYet they espouse out of date, out of touch policies. They are dead wrong for 21st century America. We are going forward, we are not going back.\u201d It\u2019s the war on women all over again. But this time, the language is more strident and the presidential candidate making the case can credibly say it\u2019s a personal issue and not just a political talking point. While Clinton later dropped the controversial wording from a later speech, the contrast will be a staple of her speeches as aides see it as central to her appeal and electoral chances. Naturally, Republicans \u2013 sensing an opening and not a trap \u2013 pounced. Rick Santorum, lagging in the polls, tweeted: \u201cI wish @HillaryClinton was as hard on the terrorists as she is on those who respect the dignity of all human life.\u201d Donald Trump fired back Friday morning, saying on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d that \u201cher last statement on terrorists was a disgusting statement, by the way.\u201d Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Jeb Bush tweeted Thursday: \u201c.@HillaryClinton compares pro-life Americans to terrorists, but defends despicable PP treatment of unborn? Her priorities are totally wrong.\u201d And the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, blasted a fundraising appeal out to supporters via email: \u201cAre you a terrorist?\u201d the opening line asked. \u201cHillary Clinton sure seems to think so.\u201d For Clinton, amping up the cultural wars with women at the center, is exactly the fight she wants as she battles Bernie Sanders (and possibly Joe Biden) for the progressive mantle. \u201cNow of course, Mr. Trump also insults and dismisses women, and by the way, just yesterday he attacked me once again and said I didn\u2019t have a clue about women\u2019s health issues. Really?\u201d she said in Minneapolis on Friday at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s gathering. \u201cI mean you can\u2019t make this stuff up folks. Trump actually said he would do a much better job for women than I would. That\u2019s a general election debate that is going to be a lots of fun.\u201d According to a new Quinniapiac University poll, two-thirds of women think Clinton cares about the needs and problems of women. For Trump, it\u2019s less than a quarter. And for Bush, it\u2019s 43%. In the Democratic field, Clinton also has an edge. She leads Bernie Sanders on the empathy question among women voters by 25%. Her strident comments came as Democrats buzzed about a possible run by Biden, whose main argument would be his working class appeal. Yet Clinton still beats him on women\u2019s issues by 11%. Speaking before Democrats in Minneapolis, Clinton dedicated much of her speech to women\u2019s issues, ticking off the positions of her Republican rivals. But she was also making an implicit argument to power-brokers in her own party, who are fielding appeals from Biden backers: nominate me and exploit the gender gap even more. \u201cAnd I know that when I talk like this some people think there she goes again with the women\u2019s issues. Republicans actually say I am playing the gender card,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, if calling for equal pay and paid leave and women\u2019s health is playing the gender card, deal me in.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Thursday's report was submitted to Congressional leadership along with a letter from Planned Parenthood explaining its fetal tissue research program. David Daleiden, head of the Center for Medical Progress, dismissed Planned Parenthood's experts and labeled the report's findings a \"complete failure.\" Planned Parenthood sent a report to Congress on Thursday that they say proves undercover videos released attacking the organization are heavily edited and inaccurate. The Center for Medical Progress, a California-based anti-abortion group, has released eight videos that it says show Planned Parenthood breaks federal laws by selling the organs and tissue from aborted fetuses and manipulates abortion procedure to procure intact fetuses. Planned Parenthood has denied the accusations and dismissed the videos as heavily edited. Thursday\u2019s report was submitted to Congressional leadership along with a letter from Planned Parenthood explaining its fetal tissue research program. \u201cA thorough review of these videos in consultation with qualified experts found that they do not present a complete or accurate record of the events they purport to depict,\u201d Glenn Simpson, a partner at the research firm Fusion GPS, wrote in a 10-page report submitted to House and Senate leadership. \u201cAt this point, it is impossible to characterize the extent to which CMP\u2019s undisclosed edits and cuts distort the meaning of the encounters the videos purport to document,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, the manipulation of the videos does mean they have no evidentiary value in a legal context and cannot be relied upon for any official inquiries unless supplemented by CMP\u2019s original material and forensic authentication that this material is supplied in unaltered form.\u201d CMP officials have uploaded several videos to its YouTube page that it says are unedited. But Planned Parenthood\u2019s investigators say due to the compression process of uploading to YouTube, even the videos that CMP claims are unedited are actually edited. The investigation team was headed by Simpson, a former investigative reporter with the Wall Street Journal. Other experts included Grant Fredericks, a contract instructor of video sciences at the FBI National Academy. Jeb Bush: Planned Parenthood not doing women's health issues Simpson dismissed the legitimacy of the videos in terms of finding answers. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t use this stuff in a court of law. Or if you tried you would not have a very easy time persuading anyone that it was useful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe missing sections clearly contain discussions that would be relevant to any inquiry.\u201d Among the quotes in the report are: \u201cThe short videos take a great deal of dialog out of context so as to substantively and significantly alter the meaning of the dialog contained in the long videos.\u201d \u201c[T]he short videos significantly distort and misrepresent the conversations in the full footage videos. Mr. Fredericks notes that the short videos contain \u2018edited conversations where some spoken words are eliminated and some spoken words are added out of context.\u2019\u201d At the time of the examination, CMP had released five videos, Planned Parenthood said. The report said experts found that there were at least 42 splices where content is cut and edited together to create the appearance of seamless conversations. \u201cIn some cases, these splices completely change the meaning of statements,\u201d the report said. \u201cPhrases on the video were isolated and removed, stringing together unrelated sentences to change the meaning.\u201d Multiple Republican presidential candidates have called for the defunding of Planned Parenthood following the release of the videos. And lawmakers and state governments have launched multiple investigations into both Planned Parenthood and Center for Medical Progress. Planned Parenthood Vice President Dawn Laguens said Thursday in a conference call with the media that CMP is duping Republican candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s really a shame that they are being duped by this material into taking these positions. Maybe they aren\u2019t being duped, but grafting onto those positions to further their own personal ambitions,\u201d she said. David Daleiden, head of CMP, dismissed Planned Parenthood\u2019s experts and labeled the report\u2019s findings a \u201ccomplete failure.\u201d \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s desperate, 11th-hour attempt to pay their hand-picked \u201cexperts\u201d to distract from the crimes documented on video is a complete failure,\u201d he said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe absence of bathroom breaks and waiting periods between meetings does not change the hours of dialogue with top-level Planned Parenthood executives eager to manipulate abortion procedures to get high-quality baby parts for financially profitable sale.\u201d Laguens said the Center for Medical Progress needs to release the full unedited videos to lawmakers for an accurate investigation to occur. V.P. of Planned Parenthood defends organization CMP plans to release all of its unedited videos to lawmakers, Daleiden told CNN. \u201cWe are providing all raw data to law enforcement and Congressional investigators,\u201d he said. \u201cThe temporary restraining order in a lawsuit from Planned Parenthood\u2019s allies at the National Abortion Federation is currently preventing us from releasing a lot of that to investigators, however.\u201d Daleiden said Planned Parenthood must release their contracts with biomedical companies for a thorough investigation to happen. \u201cIf Planned Parenthood really wants to disprove the now-overwhelming body of evidence that their affiliates traffick in baby body parts, they should release their fetal tissue contracts with the for-profit company StemExpress for law enforcement, Congress, and all the world to see,\u201d he said. StemExpress has repeatedly denied that it has requested or bought tissue or organs from Planned Parenthood. The company ended its relationship with Planned Parenthood earlier this month. \u201cWe value our various partnerships, but due to the increased questions that have arisen over the past few weeks, we feel it prudent to terminate activities with Planned Parenthood,\u201d StemExpress said in a statement. \u201cWhile we value our business relationship with Planned Parenthood, that work represents a small percentage of our overall business activity and we focus our limited resources on resolving these inquiries.\u201d Daleiden has accused Planned Parenthood of using its political allies to discredit the anti-abortion group, and the White House has previously dismissed CMP as an extremist group. And a judge who issued a restraining order against CMP preventing the group from releasing videos was appointed by Obama and contributed to his campaign. Fusion GPS was involved with efforts to smear Mitt Romney donors during Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

RELATED: The week in political hits and insults Kasich added: \u201cConservatism is giving everybody a chance to be able to be successful. That\u2019s the way (Ronald) Reagan was. I mean, that\u2019s common sense.\u201d Like several Republican candidates, Kasich is against abortion except for cases of rape, incest and to save a mother\u2019s life.

Who's running for President? \u201cI think (abortion) is an important issue, but I think there\u2019s many other issues that are really critical. Early childhood. Infant mortality. The environment. Education,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we focus too much on just one issue, and now that the issue of gay marriage is kind of off the table, we\u2019re kind of down to one social issue.\u201d Turning to foreign affairs, Kasich said if he were in the White House, he\u2019d want to partner with other countries to aggressively combat ISIS. \u201cI would have a coalition of countries, including us, on the ground, beginning to degrade and destroy ISIS. Because as you begin to do it, that whole caliphate begins to fall apart in my judgment,\u201d he said. Kasich hit Obama for not leaving a base in Iraq when he pulled out combat troops in 2011. He added that the world will likely have to deal with the consequences of ISIS for decades to come. \u201cI think ISIS has risen, frankly, because there\u2019s been nobody over there to stop them,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that all the religions of the world ought to stand up and say, \u2018You blow up innocent men, women and children and you think you\u2019re going to paradise?

            "article_content": "A conservative group filed a complaint against Sen. Claire McCaskill on Thursday, accusing her of violating federal campaign finance laws to beat Todd Akin in Missouri\u2019s 2012 Senate race. The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a conservative government watchdog group, submitted a complaint to the Federal Election Commission saying that McCaskill attempted to illegally influence who would be her opponent in the Senate race by sharing valuable polling data with the Akin campaign. \u201cSenate McCaskill did not simply meddle in another party\u2019s primary, rather she crossed the legal line and made a prohibited donation in violation of federal law,\u201d said Matthew Whitaker, executive director of the group, in the complaint. The complaint says McCaskill admitted to helping Akin win the Republican primary because she believed she could beat him in the general election. The Missouri senator wrote in a passage from her book \u201cPlenty Ladylike\u201d \u2013 which was excerpted in Politico this week \u2014 sharing how she spent $40,000 polling Missouri Republicans, and that staffers on the Akin campaign spoke with McCaskill\u2019s pollster. Federal law limits in-kind campaign donations to $2,500, a figure the complaint says McCaskill violated by allowing her pollster to share data with the Akin campaign. \u201cBy providing polling data and information, Senator McCaskill made an in-kind donation to a candidate that appears to be in violation of federal law,\u201d Whitaker wrote. Aides to McCaskill dismissed the complaint, saying no laws were broken and no polling data was shared with the Akin campaign. \u201cThis is just silly. If there was something to hide, I\u2019m pretty sure that it would not have been included in the book,\u201d said John LaBombard, a spokesman for McCaskill. Akin\u2019s 2012 campaign memorably garnered controversy with his comments about rape and abortion. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify where McCaskill first referenced giving polling data to Akin\u2019s campaign.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has appeared numerous times on Howard Stern's radio show The conversation often veered from real estate and politics to women and the two men's thoughts on them When a furor erupted last week about Donald Trump\u2019s controversial comments about Megyn Kelly, the Republican presidential candidate moved quickly to shift back on the Fox News anchor \u2014 and a graphic interview she gave with Howard Stern several years ago. Oh really, check out innocent @megynkelly discussion on @HowardStern show 5 years ago--I am the innocent (pure) one!http://t.co/8Hg7f5Q2jE But Trump has also appeared on the shock-jock\u2019s show multiple times since the 1990s to field questions about everything from the size of his genitalia to premature ejaculation, sleeping with another man\u2019s girlfriend and his wife\u2019s bathroom habits. He\u2019s also criticized several women for their body shape, described the time he watched a celebrity sex tape, fondly recalled days before the rise in sexually transmitted diseases made condoms necessary and once compared a shrinking economy to a woman\u2019s contractions in pregnancy. Trump\u2019s comments on Stern\u2019s program, while not out of step with the show\u2019s normal fare,  reveal further details of the candidate\u2019s unvarnished views of women at a time when many Republicans worry that his frontrunner status and larger-than-life persona could further damage the party with female voters before an 2016 election that could come down to the slimmest of margins. During most interviews, Stern and Trump played a version of \u201cHot or Not,\u201d a game to determine the attractiveness of women. Prompted by Stern\u2019s trademarked blunt questioning, Trump was particularly fond of describing his dislike for reality television star Kim Kardashian\u2019s lower body. \u201cDoes she have a good body? No. Does she have a fat ass? Absolutely,\u201d Trump said of Kardashian, who at one time appeared on his \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d show. \u201cIt\u2019s record setting,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cIn the old days, they\u2019d say she\u2019s got a bad body.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s got a huge trunk,\u201d Trump said in another Stern interview. \u201cIt\u2019s seriously big.\u201d Other famous women faced similar criticism. Jessica Chastain is \u201ccertainly not hot.\u201d Halle Berry is \u201cbeautiful\u201d but only her \u201cupper body,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI really like J-Lo,\u201d Trump said, referring to Jennifer Lopez. \u201cBut that ass is\u2026\u201d \u201cScary!\u201d Stern cut in. Jennifer Lawrence didn\u2019t fare well either. \u201cJennifer has a little skin problem. A little rough with the skin. I don\u2019t quite get it,\u201d he said. \u201cLittle polka-dots all over the place.\u201d Trump even had harsh words for the house maid who had a secret affair with Arnold Schwarzenegger. \u201cIt was hard to believe,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI figured this gorgeous woman with a little black dress\u2026and I said, Well, I guess a thing like that could happen. And then I got to see the maid like everyone else, and I was a little surprised.\u201d On that note, Trump lamented that his wife only hires unattractive service workers in their home. \u201cThey\u2019re not tens, I can tell you that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been very domesticated. It\u2019s a sad event.\u201d As for women Trump does find attractive, Trump pointed to contestants in his \u201cMiss Universe\u201d pageant, particularly women from South America. \u201cWhen you look at the Miss Universe people\u2026that\u2019s why I\u2019m so jaded,\u201d he said. \u201cI see these girls come in from Brazil, from Venezuela. \u2026 You take your best-looking actress in Hollywood, and I\u2019ll take, like, Miss Brazil, and you put them next to each other, nobody would even know the other girl\u2019s in the room.\u201d He also said he had a fondness for Keira Knightley\u2013\u201cabsolutely flawless\u201d\u2013and Paris Hilton\u2013\u201creally beautiful.\u201d (Trump added that he did watch a sex tape that featured Hilton, which was leaked onto the Internet.) Over the years, Trump also took on questions about his own bedroom adventures. \u201cI went through beauties,\u201d Trump said in his 2013 appearance. Ten years earlier, Trump and Stern mourned the end of the wild days before sexually transmitted diseases necessitated protection. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to cure AIDS so then we can go back to not wearing rubbers,\u201d Stern said. \u201cThose were the good old days,\u201d Trump replied. Remember 1979, Howard?\u201d In a 2001 interview on Stern\u2019s show, he got into a shouting match with gossip columnist A.J. Benza over a women they both dated in the 1990s. As Trump told the story, he stole Benza\u2019s girlfriend. \u201cI\u2019ve been successful with your girlfriend, I\u2019ll tell you that,\u201d Trump bragged. \u201cI took her away like he was a dog. \u2026While you were getting onto the plane to go to California thinking that she was your girlfriend, she was some place that you wouldn\u2019t have been very happy with.\u201d Trump and Stern frequently joked about their own sexual successes in misfires. When Stern said he struggled with having intercourse for long periods of time, Trump found a silver lining: \u201cWell that\u2019s good in many respects. Then you have to go a second time because it will take a little longer.\u201d At times, however, the interviews delved into policy. Stern was especially interested in discussing social issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion, both of which Trump said he opposes, but didn\u2019t like to talk about much. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I wouldn\u2019t change,\u201d Trump said when Stern pressed him about his opposition to same-sex marriage. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t been a subject that has been high on my list, for a lot of reasons.\u201d On abortion, Trump, who said he opposes it with some exceptions, was equally reluctant to discuss the subject. \u201cIt\u2019s never been my big issue,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSomebody asks me, and I say pro-life, but it\u2019s never been an issue that really has been discussed with me in great detail.\u201d When discussing the economy, however, Trump dove right in\u2013with a Trumpesque twist. \u201cWe just had a contraction\u2026 like a woman has a contraction,\u201d Trump said in 2013 following a sour economic report. \u201cWe had a contraction where we actually ceased to grow. We actually got smaller.\u201d Rhetoric like that hasn\u2019t been secret, and hasn\u2019t seemed to hurt his campaign. For most presidential candidates, comments like these would stop a campaign cold. But not Trump, who has successfully used his colorful past\u2013and the media and political class\u2019 response\u2013to rally his supporters. For now, Trump doesn\u2019t need to play by the same rules as his competitors, and he knows it. \u201cThe big problem this country has is being politically correct,\u201d Trump said at last weeks presidential debate when challenged for comments like these. \u201cI\u2019ve been challenged by so many people and I don\u2019t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn\u2019t have time either.\u201d A Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment on this story.",

I\u2019m convinced,\u201d Huckabee told a crowd of potential caucus-goers at the Iowa State Fair on Thursday. \u201cI guarantee you we will goose the economy if you bring $11 trillion of working capital back to this country.\u201d The former Arkansas governor and GOP presidential candidate has argued for overhauling the tax code by abolishing the IRS, which he called on Sunday a \u201ccriminal enterprise,\u201d and establishing a single, flat sales tax across the board \u2013 a proposal that has drawn heat from some economists who say it would unfairly burden the poor, a claim Huckabee rejects.

Huckabee\u2019s visit to the state came as he nabbed just 6% in the CNN/ORC poll of Iowa Republicans released just a day earlier \u2013 tying with Carly Fiorina and 15 points behind frontrunner Donald Trump, followed by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Ben Carson and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Despite that, Huckabee told CNN at the fair that \u201cwe\u2019re in a very good place from where we were before,\u201d noting that he wasn\u2019t even registering in the polls yet at this point eight years ago, before he won the caucus. He also noted that he came in third in the average of national polls that got him onto the Fox News/Facebook debate stage last week. RELATED: Look out, Trump. Bush and Christie vow to double economic growth And he spent the first part of his speech looking beyond the primary, positioning himself as the best man to beat the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination Hillary Clinton in the general election as he touted his record of defeating \u201cthe Clinton machine\u201d in Arkansas in the 90s. Huckabee, who pulls strong support from Iowa\u2019s heavy evangelical base, also used his time at the state fair to slam Planned Parenthood and call for an end to abortions in the United States. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how we fully expect to invoke God\u2019s blessing on this country if we continue the slaughter of unborn children in their mothers\u2019 wombs,\u201d Huckabee told the crowd to roaring applause. \u201cLet\u2019s start acting as a civilized people rather than barbarians. Let\u2019s stop the slaughter.\u201d As Republicans call for stripping Planned Parenthood of its federal funding amid a string of videos that raise ethical and potentially legal questions about the group\u2019s abortion practices, Huckabee suggested that would not be enough. \u201cLet\u2019s do more than that. Let\u2019s not just end funding for this nightmare, let\u2019s end the nightmare and make it so that when we ask God to bless us he can look down from heaven and say I will,\u201d Huckabee said.

She is not losing focus on the main prize by keeping a beady eye on the Republicans she could face in November 2016. The bad news just keeps rolling in thick and fast for Hillary Clinton. Deepening intrigue over her personal email server and alarm-bell polls showing rival Bernie Sanders threatening her happy hunting ground in New Hampshire are complicating what once looked likely to be a serene coast to the Democratic nomination. She\u2019s responding by adopting classic feints from her family\u2019s political playbook \u2013 finally ceding ground in an investigative standoff with authorities on her emails, but simultaneously picking new fights with Republicans she brands as extreme and out of touch. Early this week, her campaign pounced on GOP candidate and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush with a pre-emptive strike on his assault on the former secretary of state over Iraq; she called out Bush rival Florida Sen. Marco Rubio by name on abortion rights; and she mocked real estate mogul Donald Trump\u2019s surprise Republican campaign spurt as mere entertainment. READ: Hillary Clinton to turn over private email server to Justice Department Putting a policy foundation under her presidential bid, she\u2019s also rolling out meaty programs \u2013 outlining a $350 billion effort to tackle student debt, promising a wind- and solar-powered fight against climate change and taking populist positions on the economy, including warning last month of serious risks in the \u201cshadow banking system\u201d of hedge funds and high-frequency traders. Clinton\u2019s actions are a clear, implicit statement that despite a Sanders surge, a run of bad headlines and headaches over her private email server that won\u2019t go away, she remains the prohibitive Democratic frontrunner. She is not losing focus on the main prize by keeping a beady eye on the Republicans she could face in November 2016. Clinton may also be mindful of a need to fire up her supporters with anti-GOP rhetoric given that Sanders is attracting huge, enthusiastic crowds at his rallies. But her approach is also a reminder of the Clintons\u2019 ingrained habit of plowing on regardless when self-imposed crises strike, compartmentalizing controversy as just the latest blip in their perpetual political warfare with the GOP. Time and again, the Clintons have tried to redirect the focus from their own political woes back to the fundamental issues of an election or era \u2013 and their longevity in the Washington game is testimony to the fact that the tactic often works. Even so, the last few days are hardly good news for Clinton. The row over the personal email server she used as secretary of state \u2013 which the GOP is using to cast new doubt on her character and ethics \u2013 now looks certain to haunt her election campaign for months, and could even endure beyond 2016. Justice Department will investigate Clinton emails In the latest developments Tuesday, aides said Clinton had directed them to turn over her server and a thumb drive that held email sent from the account. Intelligence Community Inspector General Charles McCullough, meanwhile, said that at least five emails from the server contained classified information, raising the political heat. It is a federal offense for someone to \u201cknowingly\u201d store classified information at an \u201cunauthorized\u201d location, raising a real \u2013 if so far distant possibility \u2013 that Clinton could find herself at some point in genuine legal jeopardy. FBI officials have also been keen to get a look at the server, likely not as part of an investigation targeting Clinton, but to test whether it was hacked and foreign intelligence services or others stole classified information. Clinton has repeatedly said that she did not send or receive email that was classified at the time from the account, but she had refused to hand over the server to the Justice Department. Her campaign has said Clinton is prepared to answer any questions about the server while stressing that there is no criminal probe against her. It was concerned enough, however, to put out an email Wednesday telling supporters they may hear \u201cnews\u201d over the next few days on the former secretary of state\u2019s email account and rebutted what it said were erroneous claims about the situation. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation, so bear with us; the truth matters on this,\u201d Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote. Nathan Sales, a Syracuse University law professor, said that it was not clear how much legal difficulty Clinton could find herself in, but that her situation worsened with the inspector general\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt is not a smoking gun \u2013 but it is a bombshell,\u201d said Sales. Investigations into whether Clinton got official approval for her home server from senior State Department officials could later exonerate her or complicate her legal position, he said. But perhaps the most worrying development for Clinton is that, as the wheels of justice tend to grind slowly in Washington, the issue, which has dogged her campaign right from the beginning, is not soon going away. \u201cThis could drag on for the rest of the 2016 campaign cycle \u2013 maybe into 2017 or 2018. This is not the sort of investigation in which we could have clear and definitive answers overnight,\u201d said Sales. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight READ: Bernie Sanders beats Hillary Clinton in latest New Hampshire poll The handover of the server, which Clinton said has been wiped of personal emails (distinct from work-related correspondence) that she did not already hand over to the State Department, means she is making a long-resisted concession and relinquishing significant control over a situation that could evolve in unpredictable ways. And the uncertainty and unflattering headlines certainly add up to a prolonged political problem for Clinton. For starters, it will add fuel to the congressional committee investigating the deaths in Benghazi, Libya, of four Americans on her watch on September 11, 2012, about which she is due to testify in the fall. \u201cI get that they (Clinton\u2019s team) are frustrated. I get that they are disappointed that her polling numbers are almost as low as Congress\u2019 \u2013 but they need to look no further than her,\u201d said Trey Gowdy, the GOP congressman heading the inquiry into Benghazi on CNN\u2019s \u201cWolf.\u201d A new poll on Wednesday found that a majority of Americans believe Clinton\u2019s emails should be subject to a criminal investigation. The survey by Monmouth University found that, not surprisingly, attitudes on the issue split along partisan lines, with 82% of Republicans and only 23% of Democrats believing that such a probe was justified. It was not the only damaging polling news for Clinton Wednesday, as for the first time a survey showed her behind a challenger in an early-voting state \u2013 a self-declared socialist from Vermont, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders polled 44% \u2013 Clinton was at 37% \u2013 among likely New Hampshire Democratic primary voters, according to a Franklin Pierce University/Boston Herald poll. Clinton won the New Hampshire primary in her unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nod against President Barack Obama in 2008 after she lost the Iowa caucuses \u2013 and the state famously made her husband the \u201cComeback Kid\u201d during his scandal-tainted 1992 campaign. But given that it neighbors Sanders\u2019 home patch in Vermont and part of the state shares a media market with the liberal bastion, New Hampshire is perhaps the most likely place for Clinton\u2019s challenger to give her a run for her money. The state\u2019s electorate is made up almost exclusively of white voters and it contains many aging progressives. That tracks closely with the Sanders electoral coalition and those who turn out to his mammoth rallies, while more diverse states are less likely to favor him. Trump: I would be Hillary's 'worst nightmare' \u201cIt\u2019s the first poll that we have seen like this. Whether or not there is a trend still remains to be seen,\u201d said Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College. Levesque said that while Sanders has clearly been on the rise in New Hampshire, it could be that the state\u2019s pragmatic voters were merely flirting with the challenger to Clinton \u2013 who is so well known she is almost regarded as an incumbent. \u201cPeople will say: Can this person beat the Republican? As you get closer to that primary voting day, people weigh that more heavily than they may earlier on,\u201d Levesque said. Another poll released Wednesday, by CNN and ORC, showed Clinton in better shape in Iowa, another early-voting state, leading Sanders by 50% to 31%. There is no conclusive evidence, meanwhile, that Sanders could emerge as a serious threat to Clinton in more diverse, populous nominating states. \u201cPeople like and resonate with a candidate (like Sanders), but in the end they weigh whether the candidate can go all the way,\u201d Levesque said. \u201cShe can see the long game because he has been through it before.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump said Tuesday he would \u201clook at the good aspects\u201d of Planned Parenthood before defunding the organization entirely, one week after he said he would shut down the government to strip Planned Parenthood of federal funding. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates \u201cI would look at the good aspects of it and I would also look because I\u2019m sure they do some things properly and good, good for women, and I would look at that,\u201d Trump said Tuesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d when asked if he would first look at the full gamut of Planned Parenthood services before defunding the organization. Trump was more unequivocal last week in an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, saying the organization should \u201cabsolutely\u201d lose all federal funding. Trump did stick to his position that the \u201cabortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should not \u2013 absolutely should not \u2013 be funded.\u201d A Trump spokeswoman declined to comment on the record on whether Trump\u2019s position had changed. But Trump\u2019s appearance later on Tuesday on Fox News made it clear he supported keeping some aspects of Planned Parenthood alive and funded. \u201cThey do good things,\u201d Trump said in his interview with Sean Hannity. \u201cThere\u2019s two Planned Parenthoods in a way.\u201d But federal law already prohibits the federal government from funding abortion services, and Planned Parenthood does not pay for its abortion services using federal funds. Conservatives are now calling for the organization to be entirely stripped of federal dollars. Trump\u2019s comments drew praise from Planned Parenthood, which said in a statement that the rest of the GOP field should follow his lead. \u201cDonald Trump seems to have realized that banning all abortions, shutting down the government, and defunding Planned Parenthood are extreme positions that are way too far outside the mainstream for even him to take,\u201d Planned Parenthood\u2019s vice president of communications, Eric Ferrero, said in a statement. \u201cWe hope that the rest of the GOP field will wake up and reconsider their extreme and unpopular positions on defunding preventive care, abortion bans, and the other economic issues that women and their families care about.\u201d Trump drew heat from some anti-abortion leaders like Lila Rose, president of Live Action, and Brent Bozell, the president of ForAmerica, who has endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Bozell said in a statement that Trump\u2019s \u201cambiguous position gives voters pause.\u201d \u201cIt must be made crystal clear by every candidate in the GOP field that Planned Parenthood\u2019s taxpayer-funded lifelines provided by the federal government must be cut off,\u201d Bozell said. \u201cDefund it completely, now, and open an immediate congressional investigation.\u201d Donald Trump's empire Trump, who opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest or if the life of the mother is in danger, has repeatedly slammed the organization\u2019s abortion practices since an anti-abortion group released undercover footage of Planned Parenthood officials coolly discussing the sale of fetal tissue and organs for medical research. The sale of fetal tissues and organs for profit is illegal under federal law, though it\u2019s not clear that is what the Planned Parenthood officials were discussing. \u201cI would look at the individual things that they do and maybe some of the things are good,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to take care of women.  We have to absolutely take care of women. The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should not \u2013 absolutely should not \u2013 be funded.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The strategy allows Clinton to play offense without having to start intraparty bickering with Bernie Sanders Clinton has yet to mention Sanders or Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, with whom she shared a stage in July Hillary Clinton has vowed since day one that her campaign will take nothing for granted and stay focused on the Democratic primary. Recently, however, she has been saying \u2013 and signaling \u2013 something different. Clinton has stepped up her attacks on leading Republican candidates over the last two weeks, gleefully calling them out by name on issues like race, education and women\u2019s health. The posture aims to invigorate Democrats hungry for a fight with the GOP and casts the former secretary of state as a general election candidate well-positioned to take on Republicans like Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker. The strategy allows Clinton to play offense without having to start intraparty bickering with Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator who has drawn tens of thousands of people to events recently and is surging in most polls. It also allows her to define a potential Republican nominee early, as President Barack Obama did with Mitt Romney in 2012. The latest example came Tuesday when Clinton called out Walker on education at a community college in Claremont, New Hampshire, labeling the Wisconsin governor as someone who \u201cdelighted in slashing the investment in higher education in his state.\u201d Hillary Clinton weighs in on Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly Clinton said Walker enjoyed \u201cmaking it more difficult for students to get scholarships or to pay off their debt, eliminating the opportunities for young people who are doctors or dentists to actually work in underserved areas in return for having their debt relieved\u201d and \u201cending scholarship for poor kids.\u201d \u201cMost surprisingly to me,\u201d she added, was that Walker enjoyed \u201crejecting legislation that would have made it tax deductible for you on your income tax to deduct the amount of your loan payment. I don\u2019t know why he wants to raise taxes on students, but that is the result.\u201d Late late month, Clinton knocked Bush just minutes before the former Florida governor and Republican candidate addressed the same audience. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can credibly say that everyone has a right to rise and then say you are for phasing out Medicare and repealing Obamacare,\u201d Clinton said, using Bush\u2019s Right to Rise super PAC name to indirectly, but clearly, hit the 2016 Republican candidate. \u201cYou cannot seriously talk about the right to rise and support laws that deny the right to vote.\u201d And Monday in New Hampshire, Clinton assailed Rubio, the Florida senator who many Democrats believe could be a strong challenger, over his remarks at Thursday\u2019s GOP debate that he opposes abortion in all instances. \u201cWhat Marco Rubio said has as much of an impact in terms of where the Republican Party is today as anybody else on that stage, and it is deeply troubling,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd it should be to the press, not just to those of us who have been doing this work for so long.\u201d Clinton\u2019s battles with Republicans have even played out on social media. But the attacks are more than just rhetoric. They signal an effort by the campaign to show Democrats \u2013 some of whom may be tepid about supporting the former first lady or drawn by Sanders\u2019 liberal fire \u2013 that Clinton will stand up for her party and her positions. The fact that Clinton has called Walker, Rubio and Bush out by name is noteworthy given she has yet to mention Sanders or Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley in any speeches or responses to questions about them \u2013 despite sharing a stage with the candidates last month. Clinton has even started to signal that she is looking past her own primary debates, another sign she is steadily urging Democrats to begin thinking of her as the party standard-bearer who has the strength to stand up to Republicans. \u201cI am so looking forward to debating whomever emerges from their [the GOP] process,\u201d Clinton said Monday at an event in Manchester, New Hampshire. The refrain is something Clinton likely wouldn\u2019t have said shorty after she launched her campaign in April, when her aides and advisers went to great lengths to tamp down on talk of a Democratic coronation. At nearly every turn early in the campaign, Clinton and her advisers looked to assure voters that the campaign was not a march toward the nomination and that Clinton would \u201cfight for every vote\u201d in the primary. Clinton explains why she went to Donald Trump's wedding On Tuesday, though, Clinton finished her remarks on education and Republicans by simply saying, \u201cI am looking forward to debating on these issues.\u201d Campaign aides feel that contrasting Clinton with Republicans is beneficial for them because the differences are stark. And have said they have to do it because most Republicans have kept a laser-like focus on Clinton. The recent uptick has largely been tied to last week\u2019s GOP debate, which drew an astonishing 24 million viewers. Clinton has mentioned the debate in most of her campaign stops since the 17 Republicans took the stage in two events. \u201cReally, I admire you greatly for that,\u201d Clinton said to the New Hampshire voters on Tuesday who admitted to watching both debates. Ahead of last week\u2019s Republican showdown, Joel Benenson, Clinton\u2019s top strategist, predicted that continual focus on Republicans, whether from Clinton or during the debate, would be \u201cproblematic\u201d for the GOP. \u201cThe focus on them is going to shine a spotlight on an array of issues that are not only antithetical to many Americans, but on economic issues. Their policies are horrendous,\u201d Benenson said. CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Christian and conservative leaders discussed what's next in the Planned Parenthood fight at the two Nashville conferences this week Conference speakers told attendees that keeping this issue before lawmakers is their Christian duty The release of incendiary videos of Planned Parenthood officials has energized opponents of abortion, and those politically active evangelicals and social conservatives are pushing the issue to the forefront of the 2016 Republican primary race. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told the RedState Gathering on Friday, a conservative convention in Atlanta, that if he is elected president, he will use the federal government to investigate Planned Parenthood. \u201cNot only am I going to send the Department of Justice and the IRS, I will send (the Occupational Safety and Health Administration), the (Environmental Protection Agency) and every federal agency I can think of to go after Planned Parenthood,\u201d he said. Earlier this week, ahead of two giant confabs of evangelicals in Nashville, Joe Carter, an editor of The Gospel Coalition, wrote that the next election could have a shaping impact on the future of abortion in America. \u201cIf there is a pro-abortion president in the White House and 60 pro-abortion lawmakers in the Senate, then they will block the appointment of any justices who might vote against pro-abortion laws,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe result is that a pro-life loss in the next election may mean the opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade will be lost for another two generations.\u201d What do evangelicals think of Trump? A week after a Senate bill failed to block federal funding of Planned Parenthood, Christian and conservative leaders discussed what\u2019s next in the fight at the two Nashville conferences held by the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant body in the United States. Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush called for Planned Parenthood\u2019s defunding at one of the conferences. And presidential candidates hoping to appeal to social conservatives discussed the issue during the first Republican debates Thursday. \u201cThe pro-life movement has not only persisted but thrived because the pro-life movement didn\u2019t give up on politics,\u201d Russell Moore, president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the politics and policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said Wednesday. RELATED: Evangelicals say fight against same-sex marriage not over While anti-abortion activists have consistently been vocal since the rise of the Religious Right, the issue has risen to the forefront of political debate following the release of undercover videos that accuse Planned Parenthood of illegally selling organs and tissues from aborted fetuses. Planned Parenthood denies that any laws were broken and dismissed the anti-abortion group releasing the videos as \u201cright-wing extremists.\u201d But for many conservative Christians, the timing of the videos presents an opportunity to overturn Roe v. Wade. Speakers at the Nashville conference told attendees that keeping this issue before lawmakers is their Christian duty to ensure that Planned Parenthood is defunded. \u201cChristians should seek public policies that reflect the realities of human nature made in the image of God,\u201d Jennifer Marshall, a vice president of The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, told attendees. \u201cRemember that for the Christian, citizenship is about stewardship. Sitting on the sidelines is not an option.\u201d And on the day of the Gospel and Politics: The Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission National Conference, conservative Christian blogger Erick Erickson tweeted to make presidential candidates address the defunding of Planned Parenthood. \u201cDear Pro-Life movement, (due) to 2015 August recess townhalls what Obamacare opponents did in 2009. Demand defund of Planned Parenthood,\u201d said Erickson, who was a panelist at Wednesday\u2019s conference and RedState\u2019s editor-in-chief. Fifth graphic Planned Parenthood video released Other speakers suggested Wednesday that conservative Christians have lost influence because their approach has been filled with anger and vitriolic language. According to a recent poll, evangelicals\u2019 support for Donald Trump, who has spoken openly about his faith, is increasing. \u201cWe as Christians have a place at the table. We can speak in the public square in this democracy, but when we do so, we can\u2019t give up the character of Christ,\u201d said Jim Daly, president of Focus on the Family, a group advocating for socially conservative policies. But panelists warned guests from falling for disingenuous politicians who know how to play to evangelicals just to get their votes. \u201cThe Church as a tool is a church of fools,\u201d Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson said Wednesday. \u201cIf you are an instrument in someone else\u2019s game, there\u2019s something incomplete or wrong.\u201d",

Share your thoughts on Twitter using #TrumpOnCNN. Comments from Trump and his aide add to string of stumbles from Republican candidates who have made comments about rape GOP leaders have made an effort to repair the party's bruised image, counseling candidates on artful ways to talk to and about women Donald Trump\u2019s nascent presidential campaign keeps running into the toxic R-word: rape. For Trump, it started on the first day of his White House bid. The wealthy real estate magnate referred to some Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d and subsequently doubled down with eyebrow-raising comments. Defending his remarks, he recently told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon: \u201cSomeone\u2019s doing the raping.\u201d Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s senior counsel, sparked fresh controversy this week by making the claim that \u201cyou cannot rape your spouse.\u201d The adviser, who apologized on Tuesday for making an \u201cinarticulate comment,\u201d was pushing back against an article that reported on a decades-old rape accusation against Trump by his then-wife, Ivana. Trump distanced himself from the adviser in a Tuesday night interview with Lemon, saying Cohen didn\u2019t speak for him. And late Tuesday, it was revealed that Trump in 2011 lashed out at a lawyer who requested a break to pump breast milk in the middle of a deposition, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d The comments from Trump and his aide add to a string of stumbles from Republican candidates who have made offensive comments about sexual coercion or have spoken inarticulately about women\u2019s reproductive issues. In the 2012 cycle, Missouri Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin sparked a firestorm after he claimed that \u201clegitimate rape\u201d rarely results in pregnancy. The same year, Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock drew fire when he alleged that pregnancies resulting from rape were \u201csomething that God intended to happen.\u201d Both races were seen as winnable for Republicans. READ: Trump distances himself from top aide\u2019s rape comment Heading into 2016, many Republicans hope Trump\u2019s campaign will be seen as something of a political anomaly and that its comments surrounding rape won\u2019t tarnish the rest of the party. \u201cWhen questioned on specifics, they\u2019re the team that has spent more time on prime time than all other campaigns combined, but they\u2019re really not ready for political prime time,\u201d Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said of the Trump operation. \u201cI don\u2019t know anybody who thinks he\u2019s representative of the party.\u201d Cohen\u2019s remarks on spousal rape came in response to a Daily Beast reporter\u2019s inquiries about past allegations from Trump\u2019s ex-wife, Ivana Trump. According to the 1993 book, \u201cLost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump,\u201d Ivana allegedly described one sexual encounter with her ex-husband as a \u201cviolent assault,\u201d going as far as to characterize it as rape. At the time of the book\u2019s publication, Ivana walked backed the rape accusation, saying: \u201cI do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\u201d She released another statement on Tuesday after the publication of the Daily Beast article, labeling the story as being \u201ctotally without merit\u201d and stating that she and Trump are \u201cbest of friends.\u201d Donald Trump in the public eye Trump\u2019s campaign quickly distanced itself from Cohen\u2019s inflammatory remarks, but not before Democrats seized the opportunity to again paint the GOP with a broad brush on the sensitive issue of rape. \u201cThis is a new low. Rape is rape. Full stop. End of story. There is no difference or division between \u2018forcible,\u2019 \u2018legitimate,\u2019 \u2018marital\u2019 or any other label Republicans slap on before the word \u2018rape,\u2019\u201d Democratic National Committee Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s a pattern of outrageous comments that must stop, and Republicans should call it what it is \u2013 despicable.\u201d Wasserman-Schultz\u2019s statement alluded to controversial ways in which Republicans have discussed rape in the past, comments that the Democratic Party has capitalized on to cast the GOP as waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d RELATED: Will Trump campaign\u2019s rape comments hurt GOP? In recent years, Republican leaders have made a concerted effort to repair the party\u2019s bruised image on this front, counseling candidates on artful ways to talk to and about women. GOP strategists point to 2014 as a cycle when the Democratic \u201cwar on women\u201d strategy backfired. One of their prime examples is former Democratic Colorado Sen. Mark Udall\u2019s failed re-election bid. Udall, who made women\u2019s reproductive issues such a centerpiece of his campaign that he was dubbed by some in the local media as \u201cMark Uterus,\u201d lost to Cory Gardner. \u201cSome of the most successful candidates (in 2014) were the ones who took on the war on women unapologetically, unabashedly,\u201d said GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway, who has coached candidates on gender issues. \u201cIn 2012, the war on women was highly effective for the Democratic Party and for President Obama\u2019s re-election. In 2014, it fell flat and you had a record number of pro-lifers being elected.\u201d READ: Trump defends inflammatory comments, asks \u2018Who is doing the raping?\u2019 Still, there is particular pressure on Republicans to speak articulately and sensitively about women and gender this presidential cycle, with Hillary Clinton leading the presidential race on the other side of the aisle. As a candidate, the former secretary of state has not shied away from discussing reproductive issues such as abortion, as well as sounding a feminist tone in her public speeches. Many GOP strategists insist the controversial remarks from Cohen and Trump do not represent the party. In particular, they pointed out that Cohen is not even a Republican (Cohen has previously told CNN he is a registered Democrat). Christine Matthews, a GOP pollster who has been outspoken on how the party can better compete for women\u2019s votes, said Cohen\u2019s party affiliation makes it all the more \u201ctenuous\u201d for Democrats to try to draw the connection between the lawyer\u2019s remarks about rape and the Republican Party\u2019s values. \u201cYou\u2019d have to work really hard to connect the dots between what Trump\u2019s lawyer said, which was ridiculous, and Republicans,\u201d Matthews said. \u201cI think \u2013 excuse the pun \u2013 that would be a trumped up story. That would be somewhat manufactured.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The siblings earned their riches with the sale of their company Frac Tech for $3.5 billion in 2011 Together, their donations give Cruz and his allies more money than any other Republican except Jeb Bush Two low-profile Texas brothers have donated $15 million to support Sen. Ted Cruz, a record-setting contribution that amounts to the largest known donation so far in the 2016 presidential campaign. Farris and Dan Wilks, billionaires who made their fortunes in the West Texas fracking boom, have given $15 million of the $38 million that the pro-Cruz super PAC, Keep the Promise, will disclose in election filings next week, according to sources outside the super PAC with knowledge of the giving. The siblings earned their riches with the sale of their company Frac Tech for $3.5 billion in 2011, and since then have shuffled large contributions to the leading social conservative nonprofit groups that aren\u2019t required to reveal their donors. But they will no longer be able to avoid detection after giving a historically large and early donation that now make the brothers two of America\u2019s most prominent political donors. \u201cOur country was founded on the idea that our rights come from the Creator, not the government. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re losing that,\u201d Farris Wilks, a 63-year-old pastor in the small town of Cisco, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cUnless we elect a principled conservative leader ready to stand up for our values, we\u2019ll look back on what once was the land of opportunity and pass on a less prosperous nation to our children and grandchildren. That\u2019s why we need Ted Cruz.\u201d Keep the Promise is technically four separate committees that give three families more control over their own super PAC. Most of the attention has focused on Robert Mercer, a New York hedge fund magnate who gave the second-most money to conservative groups in 2014 than any other Republican donor. Mercer has given $11 million of the $38 million raised, according to a leader of the super PACs. Another $10 million comes from Toby Neugebauer, a Houston investor and a personal friend of Cruz\u2019s. The involvement of the Wilks brothers was first reported by National Review. READ: First on CNN: Cruz super PAC\u2019s plan to win presidency Together, their donations give Cruz and his allies more money than any other Republican except Jeb Bush, a surprising achievement for a firebrand senator more embraced at a Tea Party rally than at a black-tie business gala. Friends and associates of the Wilks brothers say they are unaffected and unassuming, depicting them as hometown-loving Texans who morphed into billionaires over the course of a decade. Intensely private, those close to the pair say they are nervous about the spotlight that will shine on their church and their family thanks to the donations. \u201cIf Dan and Farris walk into a room, they don\u2019t want ever to be known, to be announced. They just come in and sit in the back,\u201d said Luke Macias, a Texas political strategist who has worked with the family. \u201cThey are normal people. They dress normal. They show up normal.\u201d Designers critique campaign logos Several other Republican donors will make seven-digit contributions to super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations, that will dwarf sums recorded in 2012: Norman Braman, a Florida auto dealer, will reportedly give up to $10 million to Marco Rubio\u2019s. Several Jeb Bush supporters are expected to have given $1 million to his and to be eager to give more. But the Wilks family\u2019s $15 million donation \u2013 split between two people \u2013 is likely to be the largest gift to a candidate on next week\u2019s reports. Unlike some other mega-donors with an affinity for the ideological slugfest, the brothers shun giving that is meant purely for firepower in partisan fights. They choose specific projects over broad platforms. Through their $100 million family philanthropy, The Thirteen Foundation, the brothers gave nearly $19 million as part of their tithing to religious and conservative nonprofit groups like the Family Research Council and Online for Life in 2013, according to the most recent tax filings. Driven mostly by their opposition to abortion and their fear that their religious sect \u2013 which interprets every word of the Bible literally \u2013 is under attack, Dan and Farris Wilks have slowly become more accustomed to funding campaigns. As recent billionaires, however, they haven\u2019t yet risen to the profile of the other conservative siblings that have revolutionized outside spending: the Koch Brothers. Now, though, they are prepared to step right into the middle of a potentially nasty Republican nomination fight that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \u201cWe need a true leader in Washington,\u201d Farris\u2019 younger brother, Dan, 59, said in the statement. \u201cA leader that will stand up for biblical morals. We need a leader who is proud of America, not one who apologizes for us. We need a leader who encourages hard work, not one who tells people who don\u2019t work that they should make the same living as people who do. We need a leader who will make sure America doesn\u2019t end up a socialist nation.\u201d Born to a poor family that once lived in a former goat shed, Farris and Dan Wilks spent their careers as brick-builders with their own masonry business. In 2002, they founded Frac Tech, which became one of the best positioned companies to capitalize on the growth of fracking, a controversial practice that involves the removal of natural gas or oil from rock formations. Slowly, they marched toward a bigger role in the fracking industry. When competing Texas frackers looked to freeze the brothers out from the companies that distribute the sand needed to drill, the siblings opened their own sand quarry to thrive. Just as the West Texas fracking business began to boom, the brothers invested in their own line of trucks and became some of the largest fracking truck-producers in the country. In 2011, they cashed out \u2013 and began to buy enormous amounts of land in Montana for elk hunting and fly fishing. As of last year, they owned more than 310,000 acres of land in the state, making them Montana\u2019s largest private landowners, according to The Billings Gazette. Today, Forbes pegs their net worth at about $1.4 billion each. At the heart of their life, still, is the Assembly of Yahweh, which preaches a mix of Christianity and Judaism and holds the Bible as infallible. A different Wilks family member gives a sermon many Saturdays. Last week, it was Farris\u2019 turn. \u201cHe was a pastor before he was a billionaire and he continues to pastor after being a billionaire,\u201d said Mat Staver, a prominent conservative activist close with the family. It is not yet clear how the brothers plan to spend their money in the Cruz super PAC, or whether any strings are attached to the $15 million contribution. But the pair are said to have a particular desire to fund breakthroughs in social media and digital organizing, eyeing long-term opportunities to mobilize Christian voters on emerging or created-from-scratch platforms online. Much of their giving is directed by Jon Francis, a family son in-law who heads The Thirteen Foundation, but those who have pitched projects to the brothers say that their philanthropy is very much a family affair. It is not uncommon for entrepreneurs to face questions from a half-dozen Wilks family members when asking for money. RELATED: Bush raises over $100 million to help his campaign 2016 campaign merchandise That includes Republican presidential candidates. The brothers have been familiar with Cruz since he used the office of Texas solicitor general to launch several high-profile legal fights to defend Christian causes. But other Republican presidential candidates, aware of the Wilkses\u2019 net worth, have nevertheless courted their checkbook. The candidates most aggressively pining for their support, according to multiple people familiar with the outreach, were Wisconsin governor Scott Walker and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee. The Wilks family\u2019s eventual pledge to Cruz was driven by his emphasis on preserving Christian organizations\u2019 ability to operate amid cultural victories for the left. But it was also motivated by the Texas senator\u2019s ability to speak about policy in the entrepreneurial terms that the brothers use when evaluating projects. \u201cOne of the pleasures of doing business with them is they kind of treat like you like you might be the next Wilks,\u201d said Jeremy Boering, a California filmmaker who has successfully won grants from them. Boering said that\u2019s the philosophy that Cruz pitched to Farris Wilks \u2013 and why he\u2019s funding him. \u201cHe thinks he\u2019s one of the only guys in the movement that seems to authentically wants to preserve the market, authentically preserve the way of life that allows people to move from bricking walls to being a billionaire,\u201d Boering said.",

            "article_content": "Before Donald Trump was a front-running Republican presidential candidate, the real estate mogul believed that the nation\u2019s economy ran better when Democrats were in control and that Hillary Clinton would be a strong negotiator with foreign nations. \u201cIn many cases, I probably identify more as Democrat,\u201d Trump told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer in a 2004 interview. \u201cIt just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans. Now, it shouldn\u2019t be that way. But if you go back, I mean it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats. \u2026But certainly we had some very good economies under Democrats, as well as Republicans. But we\u2019ve had some pretty bad disaster under the Republicans.\u201d Trump still attacks plenty of Republicans today, but the comments praising Democrats are in stark contrast to the fiery rhetoric he deploys against them on the campaign trail, including President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. If the current polls hold up,Trump would likely face Clinton in the general election. He considered her an appealing candidate for president when it came to dealing with foreign nations. In another interview with CNN\u2019s Blitzer in 2007, he praised her ability to negotiate when asked if she could successfully work out a deal with Iran. \u201cHillary\u2019s always surrounded herself with very good people. I think Hillary would do a good job,\u201d Trump said in another interview with Blitzer. READ: Donald Trump gave out Lindsey Graham\u2019s personal cell number to America A Trump campaign spokesman declined to comment when asked if his views have since changed. Trump has been critical of the Iran nuclear agreement, which was made public this month. In the 2007 interview, Trump also said Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney could do the job, but he criticized then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for what he called a \u201csad\u201d performance. Even though he\u2019s running as a Republican now, in many ways, Trump hasn\u2019t changed. As a presidential contender, Trump has not shied away from criticizing Republicans: He has taken shots at almost every White House competitor and criticized former President George W. Bush. \u201cI was not a big Bush fan. I thought he was not up to par,\u201d Trump told CNN in May. And he has continued to enjoy success among conservatives despite revelations that he once supported abortion rights, donated thousands to Democrats and questioned the heroism of Arizona Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war during Vietnam. Despite the trail controversial statements on the campaign trail\u2014or perhaps because of it\u2014Trump has skyrocketed in public opinion polls, pulling past former frontrunner Jeb Bush. A Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted over the weekend showed that 24 percent of voters that lean Republican said they would support Trump, and earlier CNN/ORC surveys have documented his rise.",

            "article_content": "The 2016 election is shaping up to be a pivotal campaign for women \u2013 and the fundraising arena is no exception. EMILY\u2019s List, the influential Democratic political committee that backs pro-choice women for public office, raised $10.5 million in the first six months of 2015, according to fundraising figures shared first with CNN. That is the most that the group has ever raised over the same period in previous off-year cycles, and indicative of the growing interest among donors in electing female candidates. READ: Planned Parenthood chief apologizes after video The $10.5 million figure includes money raised by all of EMILY\u2019s List entities \u2013 its federal and non-federal political action committees and its super PAC \u2014 as well as cash bundled directly for candidates. Over those six months, the group raised $759,000 directly for candidates, with close to half of that \u2014 $331,000 \u2014 for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign. The group said the total $10.5 million came from more than 60,000 donors with an average donation of around $160. EMILY\u2019s List president Stephanie Schriock said in a statement to CNN that 2016 is poised to be a \u201chistoric year for women candidates up and down the ballot and across the country.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a huge show of strength from our more than 3 million members this year, and they\u2019re building tremendous momentum to elect more women who are on the right side of the issues that matter to women and families,\u201d Schriock said. \u201cWith Republicans advancing their extreme, anti-woman agenda, never has it been more important to elect more pro-choice Democratic women at all levels.\u201d In addition to its robust fundraising work, EMILY\u2019s List recruits Democratic women who support abortion rights to run for public office at both the local and federal levels. The group gives different levels of campaign support, from polling to research to communications. EMILY\u2019s List has endorsed several Senate candidates for the 2016 cycle, including California attorney general Kamala Harris, who is running to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer, and Nevada attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto, who is hoping to replace the Senate\u2019s senior-most Democrat, Harry Reid. This week\u2019s campaign finance filing deadline offered a first official glimpse into how much each of the 2016 presidential candidates are putting in their respective war chests. So far, Clinton\u2019s campaign has raised $45 million and the pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA Action, has raked in $15.6 million. On the Republican side, former Florida Jeb Bush has by far posted the most impressive figures, raising more than $114 million between his campaign and allied super PAC.",

            "article_content": "Gov. Chris Christie is about to find out whether the tough-talking style that\u2019s so popular at home in New Jersey will resonate on the presidential campaign trail. Christie announced Tuesday he is running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016. Speaking at his alma mater, Livingston High School, in Livingston, New Jersey, Christie said \u201che is now ready to fight for the people of the United States of America.\u201d \u201cWe must tell each other the truth about the problems we have and the difficulty of the solutions,\u201d Christie added. Christie is the 14th major contender seeking the GOP nomination. Christie looked to the past while making his debut as presidential candidate, holding his announcement event at the same high school in Livingston where he grew up and served as class president. \u201cWhy here? Because everything started here for me,\u201d Christie said, embracing his roots as he took the stage in the school\u2019s gymnasium. Just outside the gym, a team photo hangs of Christie and the Livingston \u201cLancers\u201d baseball team in 1980. \u201cWhen I decided to make this announcement, there was no other choice. I had to come home. And Livingston is home for me.\u201d He made clear over the weekend that his up-front style \u2013 he once famously told a heckler to \u201csit down and shut up\u201d \u2013 will be a central part of the campaign. \u201cI get accused a lot of times of being too blunt or too direct and saying what\u2019s on my mind just a little bit too loudly,\u201d Christie said in a video released over the weekend as part of his campaign, which uses the motto \u201cTell It Like It Is.\u201d He joined the race with strong national name recognition and a record in public office that spans more than a decade, having served as New Jersey\u2019s governor since 2010 and as a U.S. Attorney for the state from 2002-2010. But despite the notoriety, Christie has struggled to gain traction with voters in the run-up to his campaign. A national CNN/ORC poll conducted in late May found that just 4% of Republican voters planned to support Christie, a drop from 13% late last year. In New Hampshire, a state where Christie is devoting significant attention, he\u2019s tied at just 5% with retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush leads in the state with 15%. In New Jersey, where his approval ratings have suffered in recent months, Christie has crafted an image as an aggressive straight talker. His upfront \u2014 even brash \u2014 style of dealing with those who question him in public has earned the governor both praise and criticism, but could rub voters the wrong way outside New Jersey. His distinctive public manner, combined with efforts to provide an economic rebound to a state crippled by years of irresponsible budgeting, will serve as his selling point with voters, aides told CNN. \u201cWhat you see with Gov. Christie is what you get. He\u2019s a different sort of candidate that tells the truth and talks to voters like adults,\u201d said Samantha Smith, a spokeswoman for Christie\u2019s political action committee, Leadership Matters for America. \u201cHe has a proven record of getting things done when the odds are not in his favor.\u201d In many ways, Christie has taken steps toward a possible presidential run since the early years of his governorship. He forged relationships with party leaders in early-voting states since his second year on the job, when he visited Iowa for the first time in 2011. Christie has visited New Hampshire, which traditionally hosts the first-in-the-nation primary, 43 times, more than any other contender other than former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. As the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, Christie campaigned for fellow governors around the country and worked to build a network of Republicans in key states. In January he and his allies launched the PAC, which provided a vehicle for fundraising and travel that have culminated to Tuesday\u2019s announcement. While he may have been the darling of the GOP a few years ago \u2014 prominent Republicans and donors tried to recruit him to run for president in 2012\u2013 Christie\u2019s stature within the party has dipped in his second term as governor, particularly since the \u201cBridgegate\u201d scandal, when aides ordered lanes of the busy George Washington Bridge to be closed as an act of retaliation against a local mayor. Investigators never proved Christie\u2019s knowledge of the plan or his involvement, but the kerfuffle still brought on a long lasting sting. Despite his willingness to compromise to pass legislation in New Jersey, Christie does hit many marks as a conservative: On social issues, he has fought same-sex marriage in New Jersey and in March he endorsed a bill to ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. On foreign policy, he points to Henry Kissinger as a key influencer of his thinking. And despite challenges, Christie has worked to implement significant (and politically unpopular) budget reforms. \u201cHe is a true northeastern conservative moderate,\u201d said Bob Ingle, the author of two books about New Jersey politics, including the political biography, Chris Christie: The Inside Story of His Rise to Power. \u201cThe conservatives are prejudiced against Christie going in. He\u2019s the most conservative governor we\u2019ve ever had in New Jersey, but I think conservative in New Jersey is probably moderate.\u201d Still, his willingness to compromise for the sake of \u201cgetting things done,\u201d leaves him vulnerable to criticism from some on the right who insist on ideological purity. In March, the conservative journal National Review published a critical cover story on his record in New Jersey, taking him to task for not doing enough to implement reforms and revive the state economy. \u201cChristie\u2019s administration could have achieved so much more,\u201d the magazine wrote. Perhaps his greatest challenge as governor came in late 2012, when Superstorm Sandy rocked the northeast and destroyed miles of coastline in the state. Christie\u2019s swift and public response to the storm earned him a state-wide approval rating that skyrocketed past 75 percent in initially after the storm and he coasted to re-election the next year. Although some on the right bristled when Christie greeted and praised President Obama when he visited New Jersey after the storm \u2013 there were also been frustrations since then about the pace of doling out funds for storm aid\u2013Christie\u2019s handling of the natural disaster will likely play a role in his campaign messaging. Looking ahead, Christie\u2019s most formidable foe appears to be Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who, like Christie, also appeals to the moderate wing of the party and the donor class. Bush worked aggressively since launching his own political action committee early this year to shore up support from Wall Street supporters. Christie and his allies moved quickly to push against the notion that Bush is the inevitable nominee, suggesting that primary voters won\u2019t automatically gravitate toward the son and brother of two previous presidents. \u201cIf the elites in Washington who make backroom deals decide who the next president is going to be, then he\u2019s definitely going to be the front-runner,\u201d Christie said during a question and answer session earlier this year at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C. At Republican gatherings around the country during the months preceding Christie\u2019s announcement, the New Jersey governor also urged audiences to keep their minds open for the primaries. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve told everybody\u2014supporters of mine, potential donors of mine, staff\u2014is, relax,\u201d Christie said on a local radio show in January, a message he repeated often throughout the spring. \u201cEverybody just calm down.\u201d",

Pope's encyclical is resonating in American politics The document could test the relationship between social conservatives and the Catholic Church Republicans eyeing the White House are caught between two political blasphemies: angering the conservative base and disagreeing with a very popular Pope. Pope Francis released a highly anticipated papal document on climate change and the environment on Thursday, calling the fight against global warming a moral imperative and \u201cone of the principal challenges facing humanity.\u201d Presidential candidates and climate change In the 180-page letter, which carries enormous weight within the Catholic community and marks a significant milestone in the global climate change debate, Francis warns that human activity is largely responsible for \u201cglobal environmental deterioration\u201d and that humans must fundamentally change their consumption patterns. The encyclical is already resonating in American politics. Social conservatives in the Republican Party have long been aligned with the Catholic Church on controversial issues such as same-sex marriage, abortion, euthanasia and embryonic stem cell research. But since assuming the papacy in 2013, Francis has adopted a notably progressive tone, drawing a contrast between himself and his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI. He\u2019s cautioned that the church has become \u201cobsessed\u201d with issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage and contraception and has appealed to Catholic leaders to focus on preaching inclusion and love. Special coverage: How 2 degrees are key to climate change Now, his official exploration of climate change presents a new and delicate dilemma for some Catholic Republican politicians, including several candidates seeking the GOP nomination for president in 2016. Their challenge is to navigate the tension between the church\u2019s aggressive stance on climate, with a powerful slice of the party\u2019s base \u2013 including the fossil fuel industry \u2013 that balks at sweeping environmental regulations. Cardinal hits back at Jeb Bush on climate \u201cHaving the Pope weigh in on this topic will help the debate transcend some of the partisan divide that it\u2019s caught in now,\u201d Miami Archbishop Thomas Wenski told CNN. READ: \u2018Revolution\u2019 needed to combat climate change, Pope warns Wenski, who chairs the committee on domestic justice and human development at the U.S. Conference of Bishops, said he\u2019ll be paying close attention to how the 2016 GOP presidential candidates respond to the pope\u2019s message. \u201cI\u2019m going to look for how they\u2019re going to react in the next couple of weeks,\u201d he said. Some Republican candidates have deeply resisted the notion of climate change. \u201cThe satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years,\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said earlier this year. READ: Pope, GOP collide on climate change Former South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis, a Republican environmentalist who lost re-election in a primary to Rep. Trey Gowdy in 2010, said the papal document will force global warming skeptics and critics of environmental regulations in the GOP to do some soul-searching. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Republicans who may have in the past been critical of fellow Catholics who they call \u2018cafeteria Catholics\u2019 who don\u2019t follow the church\u2019s teachings \u2013 say, on abortion,\u201d said Inglis, an Episcopalian. \u201cBut now, are they going to become \u2018cafeteria Catholics\u2019 themselves and not follow the church\u2019s teachings on climate change?\u201d The Pope\u2019s entry into the U.S. debate on climate change will come in two stages: first the release of his encyclical this week, and then a speech before a joint session of Congress in September. On the 2016 campaign trail, Republican candidates have started fielding questions about the Pope\u2019s climate message. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a Catholic, questioned whether Pope Francis was qualified to address such a divisive political issue. \u201cI don\u2019t get economic policies from my bishops or my cardinals or my Pope,\u201d Bush said at a town hall in New Hampshire this week. \u201cI think religion ought to be about making us better as people and less about things that end up getting into the political realm.\u201d Others White House aspirants are treading carefully. \u201cThe last person on Earth I want to try to argue with will be the Pope,\u201d former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a Southern Baptist preacher, told CNN in South Carolina. OPINION: 15 facts about sea level rise that should scare the s^*# out of you Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has yet to officially launch a White House bid, said in an interview that while humans have an \u201cobligation\u201d to take care of the environment, he\u2019s wary of any kind of \u201cextremism\u201d that translates to \u201cworshiping the environment.\u201d (Kasich was raised Catholic and later became evangelical Protestant). Like Bush, some of his fellow Catholic candidates in the GOP field, such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, have in the past expressed skepticism about the extent to which human activity contributes to global warming. Many Republicans have an interest in appeasing the deep-pocketed energy industry. The oil and gas industry contributed $52 million to Republican candidates and committees in the 2012 cycle, compared with around $6.5 million to Democratic candidates and committee, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics (these figures do not include contributions to groups that don\u2019t disclose their donors). The Pope\u2019s encyclical pointed to the \u201cintensive use of fossil fuels\u201d as one of the core causes of global warming. But Republicans also face the political reality that climate change is an important electoral issue. National polls show that swing voters including independents, millennials and Hispanics tend to be more alarmed about global warming than the more traditional GOP base. Environmental advocates hope GOP elected officials who view global warming as a serious problem but fear the political ramifications of advocating for climate action will seek refuge in the Pope. \u201cThe Pope is the leader of the church, and he\u2019s taking this issue as seriously as he can,\u201d said John Coequyt, director of federal and international climate campaigns at the Sierra Club. \u201cThis provides a huge opening for a number of politicians to change their position.\u201d Others are more skeptical. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, who recently hosted Catholic bishops on Capitol Hill last month to discuss Francis\u2019 encyclical, told CNN this week that it seems unlikely that the document will sway her fellow GOP colleagues who do not view global warming as a serious problem. In fact, surveys show that Catholic Republicans tend to be far less concerned about global warming than their Democratic counterparts. Just 24% of Catholic Republicans believe that the Earth\u2019s warming is caused by human activity and that it is a \u201cvery serious problem,\u201d compared with more than six in 10 Catholic Democrats who hold these views, according to a new Pew Research Center poll out this week. Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who co-hosted the Catholic bishops with Collins, said the \u201cmoral dimension\u201d of the Pope\u2019s argument should not be underestimated. \u201cEvery Catholic school, every Catholic parish, every Catholic university, all the Catholic societies \u2013 they take on the responsibility to propagate the encyclical and make sure that people are aware of it,\u201d Whitehouse said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be huge.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Maeve Reston and Elizabeth Landers contributed to this story",

            "article_content": "The Pope will release an encyclical this week on climate change Republican presidential hopefuls fall into several different camps on the issue Climate change \u2013 long the subject of a divisive political debate \u2013 is getting a boost of fresh attention heading into the 2016 presidential campaign thanks to an unlikely public figure: the Pope. The Vatican is set to release Pope Francis\u2019 highly anticipated encyclical \u2013 an official document delivering teachings from the Pope \u2013 on the environment and climate change this week. Marking the second such document from the Pope since he assumed the papacy in March 2013, the encyclical is expected to cast the battle against global warming as a moral obligation. With his famously warm and humble gestures and a vision for a more inclusive Catholic Church, Pope Francis has publicly addressed other sensitive political topics like same-sex marriage, abortion and economic inequality. Environmental advocates are eager to see the head of the Catholic Church lend his enormous stature and influence to their cause. Democrats are largely united on climate change: They agree that global warming is caused by human activity, and that the government must take urgent action to head off deep, long-term consequences. Rick Santorum: 'Clearly the Earth has warmed' RELATED: EPA moves toward regulating airplane emissions But the issue is trickier for Republicans. The conservative base is fiercely resistant to government regulation, and the party receives enormous financial support from fossil-fuel companies. Many Republican elected officials have expressed skepticism about climate science; some have said outright they believe global warming is a hoax. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party\u2019s presumed frontrunner, slammed the GOP candidates for their positions on climate change during her first campaign rally on Saturday. \u201cAsk many of these candidates about climate change, one of the defining threats of our time, and they\u2019ll say: \u2018I\u2019m not a scientist,\u2019\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWell, then, why don\u2019t they start listening to those who are?\u201d Voters typically don\u2019t point to climate change as their most pressing concern. But over the last few election cycles, climate change \u2013 similar to the issue of same-sex marriage \u2013 has emerged at the center of a significant generational divide. While issues like the economy and national security easily trump the environment in national polls, for some swing voters such as Hispanics and independents, climate change is a key indicator of whether a candidate is in the political mainstream. The stakes are high for both sides: Environmentalists say the outcome of the next White House campaign will determine whether President Barack Obama\u2019s environmental policies can be preserved. Critics of environmental regulations, some of whom deny that global warming is a provable phenomenon, argue the administration\u2019s green agenda threatens to stymie economic growth. \u201cThe 2016 presidential election will determine whether we continue on the path of reducing carbon pollution, working with other countries to get them to reduce their pollution, investing in clean energy \u2013 or undoing all of those things,\u201d said Daniel Weiss of the League of Conservation Voters, a liberal group that mainly supports Democratic candidates. So far, the 2016 presidential candidates fall into a few broad groups when it comes to climate: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, one of many candidates vying for the Republican nomination for president in 2016, represents a faction of the GOP that\u2019s skeptical that global warming is a real phenomenon. \u201cThe satellite data demonstrate that there has been no significant warming whatsoever for 17 years,\u201d Cruz said earlier this year, making the case that the \u201cglobal warming alarmists\u201d don\u2019t base their claims on facts. Within the GOP base, this is not an uncommon view. The Pew Research Center, which has surveyed public views on climate change for years, found in August that 43% of Republican and Republican-leaning U.S. adults believe there is \u201cno solid evidence\u201d that the Earth is getting warmer. The majority of people across the political spectrum, however \u2014 around seven in 10 adults \u2014 say they believe there\u2019s solid evidence of global warming. \u201cRepublicans as a group are less convinced that the Earth is warming and where they see warming, they\u2019re more likely to think it\u2019s based on natural patterns relative to their Democratic counterparts,\u201d said Cary Funk, associate director for research at Pew. Other candidates, like Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, have also expressed serious skepticism about the theory of global warming. \u201cSomeone is an ignoramus who would say, \u2018Oh, we\u2019ve had three hurricanes this year, this proves that somehow the climate is warming,\u2019\u201d Paul said last year. Santorum, who landed in hot water for criticizing the Pope for weighing in on climate change, said this month that he\u2019s disturbed by scientists who say the debate is \u201csettled.\u201d \u201cAll the predictions that were made 15 years ago, none of them have come true,\u201d Santorum said on Fox News. \u201cSo all of this certainty \u2013 this is what bothers me about this debate.\u201d The majority of 2016 GOP presidential aspirants fall somewhere in the murky middle when it comes to climate change. They acknowledge that climate change is a real and likely problematic development. But they\u2019re also hesitant to put the blame squarely on the shoulders of humans and their pollution-creating activities like coal-burning. \u201cI don\u2019t think the science is clear of what percentage is man-made and what percentage is natural. It\u2019s convoluted,\u201d former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who is expected to launch his White House bid on Monday, said last month in New Hampshire. Fellow Floridian and declared presidential candidate Marco Rubio has followed a similar tack: \u201cHumans are not responsible for climate change in the way some of these people out there are trying to make us believe,\u201d the senator recently said on CBS. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has also said global warming is \u201creal\u201d and that he believes human activity is a contributor to the phenomenon, though to what degree is up for debate. It\u2019s a tricky balancing act for GOP candidates, who have to contend with the reality that swing voters like independents, millennials and Hispanics tend to be more concerned about the threat of climate change. According to Pew\u2019s August survey, 44% of independents see global climate change as a major threat to the country (compared to 25% of Republicans); 70% of Hispanics believe the Earth is getting warmer because of human activity (compared to 56% of African-Americans and 44% of whites); and adults 18  to 29 years old are most likely to say global warming is man-made. Former New York Gov. George Pataki, a longshot candidate for the GOP nomination for president and an environmentalist, is the favorite within the GOP field among environmental advocates. Meanwhile, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, seeking the presidential nomination for the first time this cycle, is also trying to push his party on climate change. His message: Climate change is real, it is a man-made problem and the GOP needs a comprehensive plan to tackle it. Graham said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash this month that the GOP must both be the party of an energy policy \u2014 pursuing resources like oil, coal and natural gas \u2014 as well as environmental solutions. \u201cWhat is the environmental policy of the Republican Party? When I ask that question, I get a blank stare,\u201d Graham said. \u201cIf I\u2019m president of the United States, we\u2019re going to address climate change and CO2 emissions in a business-friendly way.\u201d Mike McKenna, a Republican strategist and energy lobbyist, said positions on climate change serve as a \u201csignal\u201d to voters. \u201cWhen Lindsey Graham said \u2026 that climate change is real and when I\u2019m president we\u2019re going to do something about it, that goes after the moderate votes in the Republican primary,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cHe wants to be the moderate standard bearer.\u201d Environmentalists hope that if Democrats keep the White House next year, the next president will preserve and further promote Obama\u2019s work to reduce carbon pollution and address global climate change. Clinton has not yet delved deeply into policy proposals, but her campaign has billed climate change a priority for the former secretary of state. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee, all seeking the party\u2019s nomination for president, addressed climate change in their respective campaign launch speeches. \u201cThe announced Democratic candidates \u2013 Chafee, O\u2019Malley, Clinton and Sanders \u2014 all have exhibited very strong climate leadership in their various positions,\u201d said Weiss of the League of Conservation Voters.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Lindsey Graham introduced a bill on Thursday banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker endorsed a similar ban in his own state last week The race to be the most anti-abortion candidate in the 2016 Republican field is on. Sen. Lindsey Graham became the latest Republican presidential contender to stake his claim on the issue when he introduced a bill on Thursday banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, when abortion opponents say fetuses can feel pain. That followed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s endorsement last week of a similar ban in his own state, which drew criticism because he has said he would sign such a bill without exceptions in the case of rape or incest. Nearly every Republican running in 2016 has backed the 20-week abortion ban, and some have gone even further, with former Texas Gov. Rick Perry signing a 20-week ban into law in 2013. A federal appeals court this week upheld that law, a ruling that abortion rights groups say could put most abortion clinics in the state at risk of closure. Perry again defended the law this week, calling it an \u201cissue of women\u2019s health.\u201d Graham\u2019s proposal has been enthusiastically endorsed by anti-abortion activists, with Marjorie Dannenfelser, head of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, praising Graham\u2019s \u201cstrategic leadership\u201d and \u201ctenacity\u201d in introducing the bill. It\u2019s a clear political winner for the candidates as they jockey for support from the social conservative voters that can be decisive in some of the early nominating states, like Iowa and South Carolina. Rand Paul sparks abortion uproar with democrat RELATED: The women on the front lines of the latest abortion battle And it\u2019s telling that both Walker and Graham are maneuvering to get out ahead on the issue, as both may have a long way to go in earning their stripes with conservative activists. Graham is generally eyed warily by conservatives for his willingness to compromise with Democrats, his declaration that man-made climate change exists and recent embrace of transgendered individuals. Walker, meanwhile, must reassure conservative skeptics that remember an ad he ran during his 2014 re-election fight touting his support for legislation that \u201cleaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.\u201d But the issue holds political peril for the party looking towards the general election, where presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton could use the proposal to exploit an already sizable advantage with female voters. Clinton herself tweeted her opposition to \u201ca group of senators\u201d making women\u2019s health decisions for them on Thursday afternoon, a reference to Graham\u2019s bill. \u201cA group of senators trying to make medical decisions for millions of women: That isn\u2019t leadership \u2013 it\u2019s malpractice. -H\u201d she tweeted. A group of senators trying to make medical decisions for millions of women: That isn't leadership\u2014it's malpractice. -H And the GOP\u2019s embrace of the ban could severely damage their chances at the Senate level, where they\u2019re facing their toughest odds in years and a real risk of losing control of the upper chamber next cycle. They\u2019re defending 24 seats to Democrats\u2019 10, with a handful of those incumbents in states President Barack Obama won last cycle. If Graham\u2019s bill comes up for a vote it would put vulnerable Republican senators running for re-election in tough toss-up states \u2013 like Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio and Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire \u2013 in a difficult spot. McConnell: No Lynch vote unless Dems relent on bill Concerns over the potential political fallout initially derailed efforts to bring a 20-week abortion ban up in the House. Rep. Renee Ellmers, the North Carolina Republican who led the effort to spike the bill, said at the time that \u201cthe first vote we take, or the second vote, or the fifth vote, shouldn\u2019t be on an issue where we know that millennials \u2013 social issues just aren\u2019t as important (to them).\u201d Those disagreements, however, were eventually ironed out, and the House passed the 20-week ban in May. That version of the bill remains stalled in the Senate. Proponents of the proposal argue that a ban at 20 weeks is widely popular even among women that may consider themselves broadly pro-choice, and that it\u2019ll be difficult for Democrats to message against what they see as a common-sense bill. Gallup found last week that, for the first time in seven years, a majority of Americans identified themselves as \u201cpro-choice.\u201d But a Washington Post poll in 2013 found an even greater portion, 56%, support a ban on abortions after 20 weeks. But Democrats were already warning that Republicans would face consequences if the bill comes up for a vote. Marcy Stetch, spokeswoman for the pro-abortion rights women\u2019s group EMILY\u2019s List, noted that there wasn\u2019t a similar push for the legislation from the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential fields and suggested that indicated a shift in the party. \u201cRepublicans\u2019 extreme abortion ban legislation is a prime example of how far to the right the Republican Party has moved,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen are watching and will hold them accountable at the ballot box.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rick Santorum's strong performance in the 2012 presidential race isn't helping much in polls for 2016 He's trying to shift emphasis away from social issues, and he's sporting a new look, too Rick Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator who mounted an unexpectedly strong bid for the Republican nomination in 2012, is making another bid for the White House. Santorum launched his campaign on Wednesday evening from a factory in the blue collar town of Cabot, Pennsylvania, on the outskirts of Pittsburgh, with a starkly populist tone. He held aloft a piece of coal while telling his family\u2019s story and that of others in western Pennsylvania\u2019s coal country. He said that not only \u201cbig government,\u201d but also \u201cbig business\u201d had demolished the American middle class. RELATED: How evangelicals are fighting big business \u201cAs middle America is hollowing out, we can\u2019t sit idly by as big government politicians make it harder for our workers and then turn around and blame them for losing jobs overseas. American families don\u2019t need another president tied to big government or big money,\u201d Santorum said during his kick-off rally. He spoke to building applause before delivering the kicker: \u201cAnd today is the day we are going to begin to fight back!\u201d Who is Rick Santorum? The location is no coincidence, as Santorum drew on his own blue-collar roots, just 10 miles away from Cabot, setting the stage for his campaign\u2019s focus on working-class and middle-class Americans. Santorum also highlighted his family story in his speech, touching on veterans\u2019 issues, as both of his parents worked for the Veterans Administration. For a politician who won the Iowa caucus in 2012 and was able to keep his campaign \u2013 fueled by support from Christian conservatives \u2013 running through the spring, Santorum is starting the 2016 race in a humble place: the bottom. He came in at 3% and 2% in the latest CNN/ORC and Fox News polls, respectively. That\u2019s a dramatic difference from other Republicans who have sought the nomination again after narrowly losing it in the past. John McCain and Mitt Romney, for example, began their second presidential bids in strong shape after failing to clinch the nomination in earlier bids. McCain and Romney went on to take the nomination, though they lost the general election. Part of Santorum\u2019s challenge is that he finds himself in a crowded field of politicians seeking the GOP nomination. He would first need to get by top evangelical vote-getters like former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, Sen. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson if he wants to break into the broader GOP field that already includes Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Marco Rubio of Florida, along with businesswoman Carly Fiorina. Other heavy-hitters, such as Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, will also likely get in the race this summer. Known for his close ties to Christian conservatives, Santorum begins the 2016 race as a politician who has evolved from his days on Capitol Hill where he was known for making controversial statements about homosexuality and abortion. While he didn\u2019t disavow those positions, Santorum began to focus more on economic populism in 2012 \u2013 a theme he will revive again in 2016. But while he aimed many of his policies toward small business owners last cycle, Santorum 2.0 will train his sights on employees and the value they can add to American businesses. That effort will kick off Thursday as Santorum heads to Davenport, Iowa for his first post-announcement event where he\u2019ll meet employees of a Hy-Vee grocery store, an employee-owned company. He will then swing to South Carolina this weekend, where two of his sons attend The Citadel military college, giving Santorum an opportunity to pitch the next focus of his 2016 campaign: a tough foreign policy, which could appeal to many Republicans at a time of global turmoil. Driven in part by the ISIS threat and turmoil in the Middle East and by likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state, the 2016 campaign is shaping up to have a heavy foreign policy bend. That\u2019s a challenge for many Republicans who are light on foreign policy experience and Santorum is hoping voters see him as the most prepared to take on the job of commander in chief, having earned his foreign policy chops in eight years on the Senate Armed Services Committee. READ: Rick Santorum: \u2018Love and accept\u2019 Bruce Jenner And that foreign policy would be decidedly hawkish and built on neoconservative pillars: Santorum has called for 10,000 American \u201cboots on the ground\u201d to defeat ISIS. Other likely Republican 2016 candidates, including Jeb Bush, have been more reluctant to commit to additional ground troops in the Middle East. Santorum is also sporting a new look. He turned heads at the Conservative Political Action Conference earlier this year with a trimmer look and more fitted suit. And the sweater vests at the center of his 2012 brand? Gone as well, aides say, for good. Santorum will also hope to move on from the controversies that marred his last presidential effort, including comments about homosexuality and same-sex marriage, which he compared to polygamy and, years earlier, to bestiality. If there\u2019s anything Santorum will be looking to repeat from 2012, it\u2019s his surprise Iowa victory, when he barnstormed through every one of the state\u2019s 99 counties and edged past his GOP opponents. But as he launches his presidential campaign, Santorum is without the political operative who helped steer him to victory in Iowa. Chuck Laudner, the Iowa GOP operative who crisscrossed the state with Santorum in his \u201cChuck Truck\u201d and was considered crucial to that win, left Santorum\u2019s political operation earlier this year to manage Donald Trump\u2019s political prospects in Iowa. While Santorum\u2019s 2012 campaign was marked by grassroots activism and a cash-strapped effort, he is looking to overcome the fundraising hurdles that sank his fortunes in 2012, forcing him to drop out. He hired a new finance team early on to steer his fundraising efforts, a task led by Rob Bickhart, former finance director for the Republican National Committee. And heavyweight Republican donor Foster Friess, who helped bankroll Santorum\u2019s 2012 effort, has already started his efforts to draw more money to Santorum\u2019s new campaign.

            "article_content": "Rand Paul\u2019s long-anticipated presidential rollout hasn\u2019t gone quite as smoothly as he might have hoped. In just his first week as an official candidate, he\u2019s faced the dual headwinds of negative ads highlighting conservative criticism over his foreign policy views as well as charges of sexism for his combative reactions in high-profile interviews. The early days of a presidential campaign are critically important: It\u2019s a first shot for candidates to define themselves at a time when they\u2019ll attract a swell of generally positive media coverage and get screen time in front of audiences that don\u2019t normally pay attention to politics. Rand Paul: I'm universally short tempered with all reporters READ: Paul best GOP bet in three swing states, poll says And this early on \u2014 Paul was only the second candidate to jump in the race after Ted Cruz \u2014 newcomers face an onslaught of political media coverage. That means closer than usual scrutiny of a candidate\u2019s record and statements, along with incessant horse race evaluations of based on optics and the logistics of campaign rollouts. \u201cNo matter how well-known a candidate may be going into a roll out tour, the goal of any presidential announcement event is to provide the optics and visuals that say, \u2018Meet the next president of the United States,\u2019\u201d said John Legittino, who led Mitt Romney\u2019s national event production. For Paul, it\u2019s widely viewed that his Tuesday announcement in Louisville, Kentucky, successfully set the tone for his campaign. He aimed to appear like a nontraditional candidate with diverse appeal that would help expand the Republican base and make him more electable in a general election. The kickoff event was followed by a media blitz and an early voting state tour that took him through New Hampshire, South Carolina and Iowa. On Saturday, he completes the tour in Nevada. It was during his media appearances that the narrative of his rollout started shifting gears. On Wednesday morning, Paul clashed with NBC\u2019s Savannah Guthrie over what he considered editorialized questions and tried to direct her on how she should conduct an interview. The tense exchange quickly spread and comparisons were drawn to his heated reaction in a different interview two months ago when he shushed a female reporter. And when Paul was in New Hampshire later on Wednesday, he got aggravated with an Associated Press reporter who asked the senator specifics about his views on abortion ban exceptions. Rand Paul sparks abortion uproar with democrat SEE: Rand Paul says Dems should be grilled on abortion, too \u201cI gave you about a five-minute answer. Put in my five-minute answer,\u201d a frustrated Paul said. He also got into a mudslinging match with the Democratic National Committee when he told a reporter at NH1, who also asked a question about abortion, to challenge the Democratic group\u2019s chairwoman. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we ask the DNC, \u2018Is it okay to kill a seven-pound baby in the uterus?\u2019 You go back and you ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she\u2019s okay with killing a seven-pound baby that is just not yet born yet,\u201d he said. While Paul is known for being accessible to the media and granting a lot of interviews, he later admitted that he can be \u201cshort-tempered\u201d with the press. \u201cI think I should have more patience,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday, though he argued that he\u2019s not just irritable with female interviewers, a narrative that Democrats had been pushing all day. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty equal opportunity. I was annoyed with a male reporter this morning. I will have to get better at holding my tongue and holding my temper,\u201d he said. Republican strategist Ford O\u2019Connell, who worked on Sen. John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign, said candidates need to understand the level of attention and close examination that presidential candidates can be exhaustive. \u201cEven when you breathe, it\u2019s news,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always going to be mistakes, the question is how do you handle those mistakes and move forward.\u201d Taking on the media can sometimes be strategic for candidates, O\u2019Connell said, but candidates need to pick their battles wisely. \u201cWhat they want to see you do is be diplomatic about it and then be able to triangulate and return fire when it\u2019s something really, really big,\u201d he said. Whether those contentious moments will have an effect on his campaign is unclear. A woman who attended Paul\u2019s rally in Charleston, South Carolina, on Thursday told Paul she saw his appearance on Fox News the previous night with host Megyn Kelly, who grilled Paul over the way he handled himself in the NBC interview. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about your interview with Megyn,\u201d the woman in South Carolina said. \u201cYou don\u2019t offend women. Just keep at it.\u201d Also taking a toll on Paul\u2019s announcement week was a million dollar ad push by the right-leaning group Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America, criticizing his foreign policy views. The round of ads and web videos, which kicked off the same day as Paul\u2019s presidential announcement, painted Paul as soft on Iran, using comments he made in 2007. The attack was bolstered when conservative columnist Charles Krauthhammer said Paul was the \u201cone Republican who\u2019d be running who is the closest to Obama in his view of foreign policy,\u201d a major blow to any Republican seeking the nomination. It\u2019s long been clear that one of Paul\u2019s biggest challenges in winning the GOP primary would be his anti-interventionist views, especially as the public has grown more favorable toward military action in the Middle East to defeat ISIS. His position against foreign aid also received renewed attention this week. Paul has been an outspoken proponent of ending all U.S. foreign assistance, including to Israel. Doug Wead, a friend of Paul\u2019s who also worked for Paul\u2019s father, Ron Paul, said the senator\u2019s week had been \u201ctumultuous,\u201d but argued the attack ad was simply a sign Paul is a top-tier candidate whose unconventional GOP views on foreign policy could cross party lines and play well in the general election. He pointed to a new Quinnipiac Poll that showed Paul was ahead of Hillary Clinton in a hypothetical matchup in three swing states. But Wead said the senator, who was first elected to public office in 2010, could benefit by learning how to embrace a \u201cso what\u201d attitude when it comes to negative attention. \u201cI think he has to recognize that he does not control the medium through which people learn his ideas and views,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative on fiscal issues But he's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are eager to avoid them Cruz says the GOP needs to unite young libertarian-minded voters and evangelicals As aides politely tried to rush Ted Cruz from an event in Cedar Falls to one in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Thursday, the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him. Finally, after the selfies and conversations started to die down, his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall, burly man stopped him. \u201cSenator,\u201d he said, \u201ccan I pray with you real quick?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d Cruz said, as he clasped the man\u2019s upper arm and the two bowed their heads. It was one of the many moments when Cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week, as the senator from Texas hit the trail in Iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate. Being the only official contender in the race, Cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state. He\u2019s counting on Iowa, known for its vocal and active evangelical base, to propel him forward in what\u2019s expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of GOP candidates. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Cruz, himself, displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room. The senator regularly avoids using a podium, instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone, a scene reminiscent of a Sunday morning sermon. When he meets with people after events, he embraces each one\u2019s hand with both of his, softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye \u2013 a familiar interaction between churchgoing Christians and their pastors. The past two winners of Iowa\u2019s caucuses rose to victory with support from the Christian right, and Cruz, who announced his bid last month at the well-known Baptist school Liberty University, is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize. Evangelicals make up a large segment of Iowa\u2019s Republican voter bloc. According to a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Politics poll from January, 44% of likely 2016 Republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical Christians. Cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck GOP leadership on fiscal issues, but he showed in Iowa last week that he\u2019s also eager to champion social issues at a time when many Republicans are anxious to avoid them. He was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in Indiana, which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians. He described the outrage over the laws as \u201cshameful\u201d and an \u201cassault\u201d on First Amendment rights. 2016ers step into Indiana debate \u201cThere are a lot of people here in Iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking, watching what has happened in the last two weeks,\u201d Cruz said Friday night at an event in Des Moines. \u201cWe have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty.\u201d RELATED: Republican 2016 hopefuls back Indiana\u2019s \u2018religious freedom\u2019 law He\u2019s more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a Christian and a pastor. Rafael Cruz, who\u2019s become a celebrity among Christian conservatives, will frequently visit Iowa over the next year, Cruz told voters. And Cruz\u2019s Iowa director, Bryan English, is a former pastor. Cruz\u2019s first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on Fox News and NBC that are pegged to Easter Sunday. In the ad, Cruz talks about the impact of the \u201ctransformative love of Jesus Christ\u201d on his life. While neither Mike Huckabee, who won Iowa in 2008, nor Rick Santorum, who won in 2012, went on to win the nomination, their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners. And with both of them likely running again in 2016, the competition will be stiff. That\u2019s why, for Cruz, courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base. His stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction. He received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the IRS, and, in a knock against the National Security Agency, he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so President Obama \u201ccan hear every word I have to say.\u201d Cruz argued Thursday that the Republican Party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the Ron Paul-Rand Paul faction of the party \u2013 young libertarian-minded voters \u2013 and the Santorum base \u2013 evangelicals. The two blocs, he said, are \u201cnot necessarily the best of chums.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re going to win, we\u2019ve got to bring that coalition together,\u201d he said in Cedar Falls. \u201cAnd I think we can do that.\u201d Cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels, when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election, a higher than normal turnout for the demographic. That number has waned slightly since 2004 \u2013 but it\u2019s not too far off from the 56% of the overall population that voted in 2012. Still, his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who\u2019ve been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform, then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls. \u201cIf you look at available places for the party to expand the vote, it doesn\u2019t exist in the middle, it exists in the evangelical vote,\u201d said Rick Tyler, a top Cruz adviser. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a pond, it\u2019s an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative.\u201d Russell Moore, president of the Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention, said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says. Moore points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the U.S., as well as increased attention to the killing of minority Christians in the Middle East and rising anti-Semitism. \u201cI don\u2019t think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good.\u201d Later in April, voters in Iowa will see the bulk of the GOP field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition. While the past two winners of the Iowa caucuses \u2013 Santorum and Huckabee \u2013 are likely running for president again, Steve Scheffler, president of the group, argued that the field is wide open in terms of who\u2019s going to win favor among evangelicals. Jeb Bush, while not popular among conservative activists, was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as Florida governor and touts his Catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views. Scott Walker is the son of a pastor. Ben Carson, the former neurosurgeon, rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the Obama administration at a national prayer breakfast. And other likely candidates \u2013 from Marco Rubio to Rick Perry to Rand Paul \u2013 have made serious efforts to court the religious right. \u201cIt\u2019s up for grabs. It\u2019s a clean slate regardless of if you\u2019ve run before,\u201d Scheffler said. \u201cNaturally those two (Huckabee and Santorum) have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past, but by and large voters are going to say, \u2018Let me take a good look at all of these candidates.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "Congressional law enforcement officials want to rein in the growing number of parties in the Capitol during the annual Memorial Day and July Fourth concerts, according to a letter from the U.S. Capitol Police Board that was sent to top congressional leaders this month. The letter, obtained by CNN, cites security concerns, mounting overtime costs and an abundance of \u201ccoolers containing liquids\u201d as prompting the need for action. It says the changes are needed \u201cin light of the current heightened threat environment\u201d and \u201cto reduce the potential for a breach of decorum or conduct that could prove embarrassing to the Congress.\u201d READ: The complete Capitol Police Board letter Authorities are concerned the parties, hosted by lawmakers, their staffs and organizers of a nationally televised concert and fireworks display, have grown out of control and potentially dangerous in recent years. During July Fourth celebrations last year the U.S. Capitol was overrun with heavy drinking party-goers. And it wasn\u2019t the first time the building was filled with drunken revelers wandering the historic hallways during patriotic celebrations. Congress isn\u2019t in session during these holidays but many members stay in town to attend the concerts and parties. The letter, from the officials charged with protecting the U.S. Capitol, is a stunning admission of how much the security situation has deteriorated during these events. While there have been no arrests, there have been falls and injuries that were blamed on excessive drinking, according to a congressional source who said there was a near fall from a balcony that could have been catastrophic. Now authorities have had enough and are trying to crack down. \u201cThe enormous growth in the sheer number of people inside the Capitol on the evening of both concerts has made enforcement of the basic rules of decorum extremely difficult to manage or enforce,\u201d the letter states. \u201cIt is especially difficult to monitor and enforce restrictions on the House floor, private hallways and leadership and committee offices. Due to the large number of unescorted guests inside the Capitol, it is virtually impossible for Capitol Police to maintain the integrity of all private areas and offices within the building.\u201d SEE: Secret Service chief grilled at Hill hearing The Police Board says increasing costs are another reason to curb activity in the Capitol. Taxpayers paid $735,252 for 12,174 hours of police overtime during \u201csetup, rehearsals and the concerts themselves\u201d last year, the letter says. The board is recommending two major changes to avoid another free-for-all this summer. By limiting access to members of Congress and their guests and staffers who have offices in the Capitol building, the board would block most congressional staffers and employees \u2013 who work in the House and Senate office buildings \u2013 from entering the Capitol on the evenings of the two concerts. This would decrease the number of people attending the informal gatherings in in offices, balconies and other places overlooking the West Front grounds. These parties have built a reputation in recent years as out of control and freewheeling. One congressional source familiar with the situation described the board\u2019s efforts as an attempt to take control by reeling the parties back before there is a security threat or someone gets hurt. \u201cThe Upper West Terrace has been open to members, staff and guests for the past several years to view the concerts. What started out as a small accommodation for staff with offices in the Capitol has grown to the point where it is virtually impossible to control and/or limit numbers to achieve safe evacuation levels,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThe enormous number of attendees inside the Capitol and on the terrace on both Memorial Day and July 4, places undue pressure on the Capitol Police and therefore increases the risk not only to the Capitol but to members, staff, and attendees alike.\u201d Since 9/11, security at the Capitol has increased dramatically, but law enforcement says they are still vulnerable. The $621 million Capitol Visitors\u2019 Center was built to screen most guests a few blocks from the Capitol building. Visitors face tight limits on what they can carry in. But the letter says those restrictions \u201chave been lessened in recent years during the concerts, thus rendering secure access protocols of the building unenforceable.\u201d RELATED: Obama, Netanyahu spat seeps into Israeli election People who work in the Capitol are allowed to bring in liquids but visitors are not. The letter points out that on the evening of the concerts all bets are off as \u201cnumerous guests of staff arrive at the Capitol with bags and coolers containing liquids. These liquids are very frequently sanctioned as \u2018staff property\u2019 and allowed to bypass the regulation to expedite the security screening process.\u201d \u201cLiquids\u201d is a euphemism for alcohol, according to the multiple congressional sources. The board also wants to move post-concert receptions to the U.S. Botanic Gardens, a glass-encased, greenhouse-type building at the edge of the Capitol grounds. Doing so would mean fewer police officers would be needed to screen guests coming into the Capitol when the concerts end. But that would mean hundreds of wounded service members and veterans would not be able to be honored at the receptions in Statuary Hall, a stately and impressive room adjacent to the Capitol Rotunda that houses life-sized statues of American patriots. These receptions also include members of Congress, other government dignitaries as well as the entertainers, television producers and corporate sponsors of the concerts. \u201cThe post-concert receptions hosted by the concert organizers have outgrown Statuary Hall,\u201d the letter from the Police Board says. \u201cGuests roaming such a large area, encompassing two floors, make it very difficult, if not impossible for the Capitol Police to monitor everyone effectively and thus prevent persons from wandering into restricted areas and private congressional spaces.\u201d The letter says service members will still be granted \u201cthe special access and recognition they deserve as the tour the Capitol free of disturbance or distraction.\u201d A congressional source said details are still being worked out as to when those tours will take place. READ: Democrats squabble over abortion The March 12 letter was sent to House Speaker John Boehner, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. It was signed by the Frank Larkin, the Senate Sergeant at Arms and chairman of the Police Board; Paul Irving, the House Sergeant at Arms; Steven Ayers, the Architect of the Capitol; and Kim Dine, the chief of the U.S. Capitol Police. The four men make up the U.S. Capitol Police Board, which oversees law enforcement on the sprawling campus. CNN reached out to the concert organizers, Capitol Concerts, but they did not respond to requests for comment. Former Louisiana Republican Rep. Bob Livingston, who is now a lobbyist and who represents the company, also declined to comment. The congressional leaders haven\u2019t yet approved the access restrictions, but one source familiar with the situation said a decision was expected in the coming weeks. \u201cWe will continue to work with the Capitol Police Board and other leaders on this issue but no decisions have been made,\u201d said Kevin Smith, a Boehner spokesman. In 2007 when House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi was speaker, she began the tradition of inviting injured service members to the Capitol events.  A spokesman for Pelosi said she \u201cwill carefully consider\u201d the board\u2019s recommendation.",

Tim Ryan came out as pro-choice in an op-ed published on Tuesday After running on an anti-abortion platform in 2002, he's shifted leftward over the years He dismissed speculation his shift was in preparation for a potential Senate bid Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan fully reversed his anti-abortion position and came out as pro-choice in an op-ed published on Tuesday. \u201cI have come a long way since being a single, 26-year-old state senator, and I am not afraid to say that my position has evolved as my experiences have broadened, deepened and become more personal,\u201d Ryan wrote in the Akron Beacon Journal. READ: Walker sees \u2018gaps\u2019 in 2016 field \u201cI have come to believe that we must trust women and families \u2014 not politicians \u2014 to make the best decision for their lives,\u201d he said. After running for Congress on a pro-life platform in 2002 and initially voting with Republicans on the issue, Ryan, who is Catholic, has shifted leftward on abortion. In recent years, he\u2019s drawn criticism from pro-life activists that once supported him for voting to protect public funding for Planned Parenthood and access to contraception. Ryan wrote in the op-ed that his shift was inspired by conversations with women during his political career, but the move also puts him in a better position politically as he contemplates a potential 2016 challenge to Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican. Ryan told Roll Call that \u201cwe\u2019re certainly looking very closely at\u201d a Senate run. And while he\u2019s won re-election to his heavily Democratic district with comfortable margins nearly every cycle since 2002, Ryan\u2019s pro-life stance could have been an obstacle for him in a Democratic Senate primary in the swing state. Indeed, Portman himself has shifted on a key social issue since he was elected in 2010 with Tea Party support. He came out in favor of gay marriage in 2013, also in a newspaper op-ed, citing his experience with his gay son as partial inspiration for the shift. RELATED: Which GOP hopeful is the most like Reagan? Ryan, however, dismissed speculation that his change of heart was politically motivated. \u201cI realize that people can be cynical about politics and think this is something tied to a Senate aspiration,\u201d Ryan told the Plain Dealer. \u201cThe reality is, this is just where my heart is right now. I want to be clear about that. I would be abandoning my own conscience and my own judgment if I somehow led people to believe I was supporting a position I no longer thought was the appropriate position to have.\u201d",

But that bill was a backup, after another proposal to ban so-called \u201clate -term\u201d abortions was suddenly yanked the late Wednesday night because of blow back from moderate Republicans who argued it was too extreme. The bill barring federal taxpayer funds was approved in the last Congress. On Thursday it passed 242-179, with three Democrats joining virtually all House Republicans to support the bill. GOP Rep. Richard Hanna of New York was the one Republican who voted against it. Earlier on Thursday, the White House promised to veto the legislation if it ended up on the President\u2019s desk. The vote came as tens of thousands of anti-abortion rights activists descended on the National Mall for the annual \u201cMarch for Life.\u201d Thursday\u2019s event coincides with the 42nd anniversary the of the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision which upheld a woman\u2019s access to abortion based on privacy rights in the Constitution. READ: House GOP leaders cave on abortion bill Republican leaders initially planned to pass the \u201cPain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act,\u201d a bill banning abortion procedures for women who are beyond 20 weeks into their pregnancy.  A similar version of that bill was approved by the House in 2013. But a bloc of female GOP members - led by North Carolina Rep Renee Ellmers - opposed a provision in the bill that provided an exception for women who are raped, but required that that they show evidence they filed a police report in order to have access to an abortion.  These members argued the vast majority of rapes go unreported, and some are the result of incest. Some male members agreed that provision shouldn\u2019t be included, and urged leaders to strip it out. \u201cI\u2019m pro-life,\u201d Florida GOP Congressman Carlos Curbelo told reporters on Thursday. But he added, \u201cI\u2019m certainly not going to ever put myself in the position where I\u2019m telling any woman that their account of a rape is valid or not.\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi needled the GOP about the internal spat, saying, \u201cThey didn\u2019t even have their act together.\u201d And she criticized the GOP for spending time on the abortion debate instead of debating measures focused on job creation. \u201cThey\u2019re putting a bill on the floor that undermines the health of America\u2019s women. The bill is worse than the bill they pulled from the floor yesterday,\u201d Pelosi said in a news conference. \u201cThat affected thousands of women, maybe, this affects millions of women. It not only affects their health, it affects the personal decisions of how they spend their own money for health insurance.\u201d RELATED: Is it finally morning in Obama\u2019s America? Religious activists pushing for more abortion restrictions were unhappy with the Republican leadership\u2019s decision to cancel the vote on that measure. \u201cI have nothing but respect for the speaker but this was not the best moment for the House Republicans by far \u2013 and happening on the day on the March for life,\u201d Dr. Russell Moore, president of the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, told CNN. The late-night decision to pull the bill was a unusual win for more centrist members, who argued that the bill sent the wrong message - especially to women and young people - at a time that the party was working to expand its support ahead of the 2016 national election. \u201cThis appeared to be messaging bill, and the message that was being sent was not a very good one,\u201d Republican Rep Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said, noting that the bill was not going anywhere in the Senate. \u201cI would prefer that our party spent less time focusing on these very contentious social issues, because that distracts us from broader economic messages where I think we have much greater appeal to the larger public,\u201d he said. Since Republicans took control of the House in 2011, House Speaker John Boehner has tangled with conservatives on a range of bills, and in some cases their opposition has thwarted Boehner\u2019s legislative agenda. After the 2014 midterm election, the GOP conference now has 246 members, including 22 female members. The willingness of many of these members, and those who represent competitive districts, to challenge their leaders may complicate future legislation. \u201cThere is a growing sentiment in the conference that we want to move legislation that can make a difference for the American people and not take an infinite number of symbolic votes that might be good for a campaign ad or get people riled up,\u201d Curbelo told CNN. North Carolina Republican Rep. Richard Hudson, who said he wasn\u2019t involved in the discussions about the bill, said, \u201cNone of us saw it coming.\u201d Court strikes down abortion buffer zones He pointed out that members voted on the same bill last year, and said, \u201cNow there is a concern, then there wasn\u2019t.\u201d Much of the criticism from anti-abortion rights groups centered on Ellmers. Moore said activists at the Match for Life took notice of the North Carolina Republican\u2019s role. \u201cI\u2019ve heard the name Renee Ellmers once every 20 seconds this morning on the mall,\u201d he said. She issued a statement after Thursday\u2019s vote saying she still was still discussing bringing the 20-week abortion bill ban bill back to the floor. \u201cOur goal is to find a way to get this legislation in its best possible form,\u201d she said. Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona, the author of the bill that didn\u2019t get a vote, told reporters he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d and said he was confident the measure would have passed. He said he didn\u2019t question his leaders commitment to fighting for anti-abortion rights bills and said he had their \u201cword of honor\u201d the House would eventually hold a vote on it.",

            "article_content": "At the March for Life on Thursday, thousands of pro-life activists pledged to end abortion The night before, House GOP leadership decided to drop a bill banning abortion at 20 weeks of pregnancy The move reflects the challenge for the GOP heading into 2016, as it tries to expand its appeal Tens of thousands of pro-life activists descended on Washington on Thursday for the annual March for Life, marking the 42nd anniversary of the Supreme Court\u2019s Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal \u2014 by promising to end it. By the size of the crowds and the enthusiasm of the speakers, it was impossible to tell that just the night before, Republican leaders on Capitol Hill had spiked one of social conservatives\u2019 biggest priorities, a bill banning abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy. READ: House passes abortion measure The scramble over the bill behind closed doors was the latest in a series of conflicts within the caucus, and again underscored the challenge facing the GOP as they head into a presidential election year: How to expand the party\u2019s appeal with untapped demographic groups, while still appeasing their conservative base. That was the concern raised by Rep. Renee Ellmers, the North Carolina Republican who, along with a group of GOP women and centrists in the party, led the successful effort to get the bill pulled. \u201cThe first vote we take, or the second vote, or the fifth vote, shouldn\u2019t be on an issue where we know that millennials\u2014social issues just aren\u2019t as important [to them],\u201d she told National Journal last week. Ellmers and Rep. Jackie Walorski pulled their sponsorships because of concerns over a requirement that rape victims file a police report to get an exemption from the ban. Other centrist Republicans expressed concerns on Thursday that the party should be focusing on less controversial issues with broader appeal. \u201cThis appeared to be messaging bill, and the message that was being sent was not a very good one,\u201d Republican Rep Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said. \u201cI would prefer that our party spent less time focusing on these very contentious social issues, because that distracts us from broader economic messages where I think we have much greater appeal to the larger public,\u201d he said. The GOP has long faced significant issues in wooing single female voters and young voters, which contributed to its unexpected loss of the White House in 2012. After that election, an RNC post-mortem report diagnosing the party\u2019s problems suggested the GOP \u201cmust in fact and deed be inclusive and welcoming\u201d on social issues. SEE ALSO: House GOP leaders cave on abortion bill But as centrists in the party look to move away from the abortion issue, they\u2019ll run up against fierce opposition from social conservatives, who were calling for revenge against Ellmers and other lawmakers who led the effort to drop the bill. Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, told CNN she met with House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Wednesday night and was \u201cshocked and surprised\u201d when she was told they wouldn\u2019t be bringing the bill to a floor for a vote. \u201cNo one ever brought up any of these issues. No one ever brought it up in the Senate races where we injected it in the middle of the campaign,\u201d she said. \u201c[House Republicans] have managed to really pull [defeat] out of the jaws of victory for sure.\u201d House leadership has told her that the bill will eventually come up for a vote, but gave her no time line. A leadership aide said lawmakers are going to discuss how to move forward with the bill, but it\u2019s not clear what\u2019s next for it. Dannenfelser said Ellmers is almost certain to face a primary challenge in 2012. \u201cMy phone does not stop ringing with people asking me, what are we going to do about her next year? I want to stay focused on getting the bill passed \u2014 but some people \u2026 there\u2019s no protecting some people once they\u2019ve gone past the tipping point,\u201d she said. Ellmers represents a GOP-leaning district and won her last primary with less than 60% support, so the threat of a challenge in 2016 over the abortion issue is a significant one for her. But it\u2019s less clear how the issue will play out for the GOP as a whole. This time last year, the RNC passed a resolution urging Republican candidates to speak out on the abortion issue on the campaign trail, and attendees at the event, including RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, said it was a winning issue. This time around, Priebus was elsewhere, and Republicans made little mention the abortion issue at their winter meeting. Most of the GOP\u2019s likely presidential contenders kept mum on the developments on Capitol Hill. Rick Santorum, who was the favorite of social conservatives during the 2012 race and is contemplating another run, was relatively subdued about leadership pulling the bill. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed,\u201d he said, \u201cbut leadership is just doing what good leadership does \u2014 which is listen to its members and try to work out a bill that is acceptable to the most within the caucus.\u201d And  few dozen protesters, mostly college students and older activists, gathered outside Ellmers\u2019 office after the march to express their frustration with her move. One, Students for Life President Kristan Hawkins, called Ellmers a \u201ccoward\u201d for previously supporting a similar bill, before working to block this one. But asked whether candidates should run on the abortion issue if they hope to appeal to millennials, she demurred. \u201cObviously, there are a ton of important issues that millennials care about\u2026but I think they shouldn\u2019t shy away from it,\u201d she said.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Paul Waldman: Some think Paris attacks will pull voters to GOP establishment candidates for experience, not bombast. Wishful thinking. Donald Trump has asked whether Iowa voters were \"stupid.\" Fact is, voters display stunning ignorance of basic issues.  Bombast is winning. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris, establishment Republicans are hopeful that their voters will finally come to their senses, realize that they need a seasoned hand on the tiller of state and stop their dalliance with \u201coutsider\u201d candidates who have little idea how to handle foreign and military affairs. \u201cBombast doesn\u2019t cut it. Inexperience doesn\u2019t cut it,\u201d former Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge told The New York Times. \u201cThose who have a record of governance and demonstrated leadership capabilities \u2013 their stock is going to rise.\u201d That\u2019s what you call wishful thinking. When was the last time the voting public responded to an external threat by becoming serious and thoughtful? If anything, Republican voters are likely to be even more attracted to those who offer bombast and bluster \u2013 and the truth is, that\u2019s what they\u2019re getting from most every candidate, experienced or not. Don\u2019t be surprised if Donald Trump \u2013 who literally says that the answer to the problem of ISIS is, \u201cWe go in, we knock the hell out of them, take the oil\u201d \u2013 winds up even stronger. Can Trump survive? And Trump isn\u2019t going to mince words. Unlike most politicians who shower voters with praise like they\u2019re preschoolers bringing home their first art project, Trump will tell them when they let him down. Faced with the fact that he is trailing Ben Carson in Iowa polls (and some national polls as well), last week Trump went on a spectacularly weird 95-minute rant that laid into the good folk of the Hawkeye State for accepting some of the stories in Carson\u2019s autobiography and elevating him to the top of the pack. \u201cHow stupid are the people of Iowa? How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cDon\u2019t be fools, OK?\u201d Trump seems to believe that only a fool would reject him in favor of any other candidate, a questionable assertion to say the least. But on the broader point, was he right? Well, yes. When it comes to politics, the American people are indeed not so sharp. But perhaps \u201cstupid\u201d isn\u2019t quite the right word, since it suggests a fundamental and unchangeable state of their minds. \u201cUninformed\u201d or \u201cignorant\u201d might be better. \u201cFoolish\u201d works, too. Right now, the idiocy is on particular display in the intense Republican primary contest.  Half of the GOP electorate is supporting either a vulgarian reality TV personality or a doctor who has zero experience in politics or government, believes in bizarre conspiracy theories and can\u2019t manage to string together a coherent paragraph on the issues he\u2019d actually confront if he were president. Even some Republican Party stalwarts are horrified at where these voters are leaning; as one told The Washington Post, \u201cWe\u2019re potentially careening down this road of nominating somebody who frankly isn\u2019t fit to be president in terms of the basic ability and temperament to do the job.\u201d It\u2019s something political scientists have known for decades: as a whole, the public knows distressingly little about the issues government deals with and candidates argue about. Even basic, unchanging facts about the political world are lost on significant portions of the electorate. For instance, in this study from the Pew Research Center, three out of 10 people could not identify the Republicans as the more conservative party \u2013 the most fundamental distinction you\u2019d need to grasp anything about politics. Just 61% knew that it was the Republicans who want to restrict abortion, while 53% said they\u2019re the party that wants to reduce the size of government. These are questions where respondents had a 50% chance of getting the answer right with just a random guess. So you can forget about their ability to evaluate the differences in the candidates\u2019 tax plans. If everyone had even a basic understanding of what separates the two parties, we\u2019d hardly need general election campaigns at all. Ask yourself this: Is there likely to be anything that happens in next fall\u2019s campaign that will change your mind about your vote? A powerful TV ad, a candidate\u2019s \u201cgaffe,\u201d a clever riposte in a debate? The fact that one candidate is taller, or another has a soothing voice, or a third is better at explaining just how damn much he loves this country? Obama Democrats: Do any GOPers have the right stuff to win? You\u2019d probably say, \u201cOf course not. Stuff like that doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d But it obviously matters to somebody, because that\u2019s what we spend a year or two before every election talking about. There is, of course, another possibility: People aren\u2019t dumb; they just don\u2019t care. They have lots of other things to worry about besides politics \u2013 their jobs, their families, their fantasy sports teams \u2013 and they know plenty about those things. They choose not to pay much attention to political affairs, but if they did, they could be as informed as any political junkie. That makes sense, but it still leaves us with a problem. The people we elect to high office make decisions that affect all our lives in profound ways. You can decide to ignore something like sports and it won\u2019t make much difference. But as an old saying has it, you may not take an interest in politics, but politics will take an interest in you. And when people suddenly start paying attention \u2013 like when there\u2019s a dramatic terrorist attack \u2013 there\u2019s little reason to believe they\u2019re suddenly going to be wiser about politics than they were before.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Sally Kohn:  Fiorina's boost in polls doesn't mean she -- or any other GOP candidate -- support pro-woman policies.  Far from it Kohn: GOP has big problem with women, from opposing hike in minimum wage and funding Planned Parenthood to backing equal pay The 2016 Republican primary contenders may look much more like Americans than the GOP candidates of the past. They are more ethnically diverse and, crucially, there is (still) a woman in the mix. But if the race so far is any indication, the Republican Party still has the big problem with women voters it had last election: Back then, Mitt Romney edged ahead on male voters, but President Obama won women voters by 12 percentage points. You might think the storied soul searching that followed that election \u2013 when the Republican National Committee studied how to better appeal to women voters, as well as blacks and Latinos and the gay community \u2013 would have changed the way the party\u2019s candidates, including the lone woman contender, approached the race. But don\u2019t be fooled: The same anti-woman nonsense that turned off mainstream voters before is once again pouring forth from this year\u2019s Republican crop. Take, for instance, gender: Carly Fiorina may be gaining on frontrunner Donald Trump after her assertive showing at last week\u2019s CNN debate, but her candidacy has in large part served to highlight the sexism of the Republican Party in general: fellow Republican Donald Trump mocking her face, for example, and Chris Christie mansplaining to her during the debate about interrupting. And Carly Fiorina, it turns out, ain\u2019t no feminist heroine herself. Fiorina has poo-pooed the idea of \u201cidentity politics\u201d and feminism, even as she promotes her candidacy, and her deflection of other candidates\u2019 attacks, as a battle waged by the only woman in the race. Carly Fiorina's political career But how does her being a woman translate into pro-women policies?  Here\u2019s a clue:  Last month Carly Fiorina said she thought there should be no federal minimum wage.  Friendly candidate to women?  Not the women who make up two-thirds of minimum wage earners.  (Jeb Bush has taken the same position.) And consider: All \u2013 every single one \u2013 of the 15 remaining GOP candidates firmly opposed pro-women policies. For instance, they all support cutting funding for Planned Parenthood \u2013 though a few wouldn\u2019t actually shut down the entire federal government to do so, on their overall opposition they\u2019re unanimous.  And they don\u2019t blink as they offer willfully misleading statements to justify this anti-women stance. Relying on a series of edited smear videos, and in turn misrepresenting what those videos depict, for example, Sen. Ted Cruz said at the CNN debate that they showed Planned Parenthood \u201cbartering and selling the body parts of human beings,\u201d essentially confessing \u201cto multiple felonies.\u201d This assertion, which candidates like Fiorina and Christie regurgitated \u2013 and embellished \u2013 before millions, is false.  Period. The organization, which provides health services to more than 5 million Americans every year, does indeed perform abortions as a small percentage of its work.  And in some cases, women can choose to donate the fetal tissue from their abortions to science.  However, no profit is made off those donations, something already clearly barred by federal law.  And in any case, laws also already ban Planned Parenthood from using government money for abortion services. The fact is, most Americans consistently support safe and legal access to abortion, but even many of those who don\u2019t support that still support women\u2019s access to health services.  During the CNN debate not a single candidate talked about \u201caccess to contraception\u201d or even \u201cexceptions for rape\u201d or \u201cincest\u201d when talking about their extremist positions on abortion. In fact,  none of the candidates at the GOP debate talked about \u201cequal pay\u201d or \u201cworking women\u201d or the \u201cchallenges women and families face.\u201d They didn\u2019t even bring up the word \u201cinequality.\u201d  They may have had a woman in the room, but that was as far as they went. Meanwhile, despite the fact that women who work full-time, year-round still make roughly 80% of what men make, an alarming number of the Republican candidates are apparently opposed to equal pay.  Gov. Scott Walker repealed his state\u2019s equal pay law.   And Sens. Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio oppose federal equal pay proposals.  The GOP candidates appear to be competing with each other to see who can champion the most outlandish, fact-less, unpopular anti-women policies possible.  If they keep it up, they won\u2019t need an autopsy after the 2016 election.  There will be no viable party left to examine.

Carson\u2019s rise began when he bashed President Obama\u2019s signature policy achievement in front of his face at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, landing a book deal and embarking on a tour that he\u2019s managed to successfully transform into one of the GOP\u2019s most formidable online fund-raising machines. Without the benefits of broadcast television, or the political infrastructure befitting a governor or United States senator, Carson took his book tour as lead time to build a national online fund-raising apparatus beginning in 2014.  That May, Carson began a road show throughout the heart of the evangelical South \u2013 North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas \u2013 which culminated with four stops in Iowa.  And when you look at his last Federal Election Commission report, you can see it paid off. The states from which the most contributions came are \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama and Iowa, for a total of more than $10 million in small donations. Carson questions authenticity of Trump's faith Carson has bragging rights to one of the most robust fund-raising lists of the GOP field, though bragging is not his thing.  According to Phil Musser, chairman of the digital media agency IMGE (which is unaligned in the GOP race), \u201cCarson quietly built an online fundraising and grassroots leviathan in 2014 and 2015.  That has helped him successfully raise small dollar money like no other contender for the GOP nomination. It\u2019s a major asset to his candidacy, and will prove to be a very smart early investment that powers his candidacy late.\u201d Carson\u2019s support, especially in states like Iowa, is strongest among Christian evangelicals and women. His enthusiasm numbers in that state are higher than Trump\u2019s. Carson has eclipsed Mike Huckabee, Sen. Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum as the viable moral majority candidate for 2016. The quiet candidate gains on Trump Ben Carson has what Iowa caucus-goers favor \u2013 the soft touch and outsider status, and no fear of going after Obamacare and the excesses of Washington.  In a time where the middle class is squeezed by stagnant incomes and rising health care costs, Ben Carson looks like he cares. In Iowa, he speaks to Rotary clubs and banquet halls, and has been there for more than 12 months \u2013 not just helicoptering into the Iowa State Fair, but taking the time to get to know the folks. That\u2019s the difference. Trump, Carson, Fiorina -- rise of the outsiders As the debate looms, Dr. Ben Carson also has the best strategy for dealing with The Donald: be bigger than the bully.  After questioning Trump\u2019s faith, the son of a Seventh Day Adventist minister apologized and thereby avoided the continued tsunami of insults afforded regular dolts in Trump\u2019s crosshairs. Does this mean staying power?  Not necessarily \u2013 I like to remind people that the only civilian (not former military general) to win the presidency without having ever held elective office was Herbert Hoover. And Hoover, my great grandfather, was a hero of World War I for organizing the first massive international humanitarian relief effort to feed occupied Belgium, then served in the cabinets of Democrat and Republican presidents for eight years before winning the presidency. This path to the presidency is not well trodden. Nor does Carson\u2019s base of support suggest the possibility for broad mainstream support.  His comments about gays and abortion have been notably outside the mainstream \u2013 I\u2019ve even suggested his views on LGBT people are \u201cuntethered to reality\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s galvanized and streamlined support from one of the most significant legs in the modern conservative movement, and that\u2019s why Ben Carson enters \u201cRound 2\u201d tonight, as a close front-runner for the GOP nomination.

Cupp is the author of \u201cLosing Our Religion: The Liberal Media\u2019s Attack on Christianity,\u201d co-author of \u201cWhy You\u2019re Wrong About the Right\u201d and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. S.E. Cupp: Clinton making women central to outreach, but she should really focus on men In 2014 election, overplaying to one gender failed -- particularly with \"war on women\" It\u2019s clear from Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign rollout \u2013 a video announcement/campaign ad/short film that debuted Sunday afternoon \u2013 that she will make women and being a woman central to her outreach. In case you\u2019re skeptical, Vox has posted a handy \u201cby the numbers\u201d for her campaign video, and there are 38 people besides Clinton in the two-minute ad. Twenty of them are women. There are three separate mentions of motherhood. This is all fine and good (and predictable) if you acknowledge that the proportion of women who vote has exceeded the proportion of men who vote in every presidential election since 1980. And let\u2019s not overlook the fact that Clinton is in fact a woman, and that\u2019s a fine thing to celebrate. But in reality, she doesn\u2019t have to wonder if a woman-centered campaign is the best strategy. She can simply look back to the most recent elections to see that overplaying to one half of the eligible-voting population failed spectacularly all over the country, in red and blue states, when that strategy was employed by both male and female candidates. As I\u2019ve previously written, the 2014 midterm elections saw the death of a political meme: the \u201cwar on women.\u201d Granted, that\u2019s not because Republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women. But it is noteworthy that Democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues (and men) crashed and burned. To wit: In Colorado, Sen. Mark Udall was nicknamed \u201cMark Uterus\u201d for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women\u2019s reproductive issues, only to end up, according to exit polls, eight points ahead among women. His opponent, Cory Gardner, finished 17 points ahead among men. In New York, a Democratic candidate for Congress, Martha Robertson, drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a \u201cwar on women.\u201d To repeat, she was a woman, a Democrat, in New York. Reporters run after Hillary Clinton's van in Iowa In Louisiana, Sen. Mary Landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for Democrats\u2019 lack of popularity in the South. Not surprisingly, Southerners voted for her opponent, Bill Cassidy. In Texas, where liberal Wendy Davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform, she accused Republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography. Her opponent, Greg Abbott, won by 20 points, and Davis only ended up with 47% of the women vote. Whether in Texas or Colorado, New York or Louisiana, voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and weren\u2019t going to be bullied into voting Democratic by false cries of sexism. But while Democrats were screaming about the Republicans\u2019 \u201cwar on women,\u201d few in the media acknowledged that the Democrats\u2019 deficit among men was actually greater than the Republicans\u2019 deficit among women. Exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for Republicans over Democrats by a 16-point margin, and women voted for Democrats by only a four-point margin. Regardless of whom Republicans run for president, Hillary Clinton will most likely get the women vote. What she needs are men. So instead of running a woman-centered campaign, she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex. \u200bRead CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

            "article_content": "Chris Massaro tugs at his clerical collar, swapping it out for another as he pulls on a black cassock and white surplice in preparation for Mass. It\u2019s the sort of repeated daily change \u2013 between black clerical clothes, vestments for Mass, work clothes and back again \u2013 that he\u2019s still getting used to as a first-year Catholic seminarian. \u201cI\u2019ve been sweating constantly and that\u2019s frustrating, I got to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cI enjoy the schedule, but there are parts of the schedule I don\u2019t like \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing. It works on obedience.\u201d Ask Massaro what he used to think his life would look like at 24 and the answer is immediate: \u201cNothing like this.\u201d He had girlfriends. He was a sports nut who couldn\u2019t get enough of his New York Giants. He enjoyed the adrenaline rush of triathlons and Tough Mudder obstacle courses. He enrolled in a Ph.D. program in medical physics at Vanderbilt University and imagined a career that would allow him to care for a family. Now he\u2019s one of nine men taking part in their \u201cSpiritual Year\u201d at Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary \u2013 one stop in a seven-year journey to become priests. Unlike the other 130-plus seminarians living at Saint Charles\u2019 sprawling, picturesque campus on Philadelphia\u2019s Main Line \u2013 where Pope Francis will stay this weekend \u2013 these men are spending the year in a no-frills brick building 20 minutes away. Living with them is the Rev. Christopher Cooke, who directs the one-year program and serves as an adviser. It\u2019s a dedicated time spent apart \u2013 free of tests, grades and outside tensions \u2013 to go deep, focus on prayer and develop their personal relationships with God. \u201cBut,\u201d says Cooke, \u201cdon\u2019t get the idea that this is a year of resting in hammocks.\u201d Saint Charles is part of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, which last month announced the seminary\u2019s enrollment had grown three-fold. Twenty new seminarians entered this fall, compared to seven the year before. It\u2019s the largest increase in more than a decade. Coming two years after Francis\u2019 election, could the uptick in wannabe priests be linked to the Pope\u2019s popularity? The Rev. Charles Frederico, a vocation director for the Jesuits, has suggested as much. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Pope Francis is having an effect on young people,\u201d says Frederico, who serves as a sounding board to those considering the priesthood. He\u2019s been fielding anywhere from five to seven inquiries a week. Before Francis, he says, he received one inquiry a week, and sometimes none. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard so many Jesuits talk about the Pope,\u201d Frederico says of members of the Society of Jesus, which works with people on the margins and carries a strong social justice component. \u201cHe\u2019s speaking our lingo.\u201d As he should, given that Francis is the first Jesuit to become pope. But the vocation director for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia is more guarded. The Rev. Stephen DeLacy trusts that the \u201cFrancis effect\u201d is real, but he says all of the guys he\u2019s worked with since the start of this papacy would have made the leap to seminary even if Pope Benedict XVI was still leading the Catholic Church. He thinks next year will be a better time to measure Francis\u2019 influence. A new vocation recruitment program, \u201cCalled by Name,\u201d is being introduced this fall to build on the Pope\u2019s Philadelphia visit and the ways the archdiocese expects him to inspire parishioners. Francis may be important to would-be seminarians in that he\u2019s \u201ccreating an atmosphere that\u2019s freeing them up to come in,\u201d DeLacy says. But Philadelphia was also caught up in the priest sex abuse scandal, which had a \u201cdampening effect\u201d on enrollment \u2013 an effect that, with time, may only now be lifting. The need for more seminarians and, by extension, priests, is real, says Mary Gautier, senior research associate at the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate. She points to statistics to show the glaring decline over the years. Peak seminary enrollment, she says, was in the late 1960s. In 1965, there were 8,325 graduate-level seminarians. Today, at 3,650, the numbers are less than half. Meantime, the number of priests in the United States fell from nearly 59,000 in 1965 to less than 38,000 today. And while the number of seminarians has held pretty steady over the past 15 years, in the 3,500 range, Gautier says the country is ordaining each year \u201conly about a third of what we need.\u201d Whether Pope Francis will help bring in the needed numbers, she says, remains to be seen. The Pope: Not just for Catholics anymore Ultimately, it was not the Pope, but rather a string of girlfriends and priests that led Chris Massaro to Saint Charles. He grew up in the Catholic Church in Coatesville, Pennsylvania \u2013 an old steel town west of Philadelphia \u2013 though his family was not particularly devout. He got involved with a parish youth group in high school, and his devotion grew further when he went to nearby West Chester University and began frequenting the Catholic ministry center on campus. The center\u2019s director asked him a couple times if he\u2019d ever thought about the priesthood, but his answer was a knee-jerk \u201cno\u201d \u2013 not because the idea disgusted him, Massaro says, but because he assumed he was on track to wed. \u201cMy Catholic upbringing wasn\u2019t very in depth, so I wasn\u2019t around priests other than Mass on Sunday,\u201d he says. \u201cMy only exposure was to marriage. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, but it doesn\u2019t really open you up so much to other possibilities.\u201d Massaro says he appreciates how Pope Francis has made the Catholic faith accessible. He\u2019s \u201con a level that ordinary Joes can grasp, which is great,\u201d Massaro says. \u201cThat\u2019s what we need to meet people where they are.\u201d And while he\u2019s been influenced by the Pope, Massaro says he\u2019s in seminary thanks to others \u2013 including the priests and Catholic communities he came to know in high school, college and graduate school. But it\u2019s through his relationships with women that he traces how he ended up at Saint Charles. He arrived at college already a year into a relationship, which continued into his sophomore year. She was Christian, but not Catholic, and \u201cI couldn\u2019t get her to come to Mass,\u201d he says. As he became increasingly devout, this became more of a struggle. To his relief, his next girlfriend was Catholic, but she also wasn\u2019t as committed to the faith. By his third relationship, he found a woman who was an involved Catholic \u2013 but to his dismay, they, too, had differences. \u201cI was expecting others to conform to me as opposed to me really looking inside,\u201d he says. He began to realize that he was looking at these relationships in a \u201cprideful and selfish way.\u201d A switch flipped, and he turned to prayer. For 54 days straight he recited the Rosary Novena, asking for humility. He began to see that \u201can authentic Catholic relationship, an authentic Christian relationship with our Lord and the people around us, is supposed to be selfless \u2013 and I hadn\u2019t been living that way.\u201d He opened himself up to possibilities. He realized \u201cmy life was meant to be lived as a gift in the way God intended from the beginning.\u201d At Vanderbilt, he began going to Mass four or five times a week. On top of that, he did an hour of prayer every day. And in a leap of faith, he came here. Massaro says at first he was nervous to tell people. Friends who weren\u2019t Catholic. The director of his Ph.D. program. (Massaro left Vanderbilt early with only his master\u2019s.) His family. \u201cI was expecting some kickback,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I didn\u2019t really get too much, which was great.\u201d Instead, he found people were supportive in ways he didn\u2019t anticipate. He credits \u201cthe power of prayer\u201d for this \u2013 not just his own, but the prayers he received from others who knew he was grappling with this decision. But he still isn\u2019t 100% sure he\u2019ll see his new journey through to the end. \u201cMarriage is a beautiful vocation. It truly is,\u201d he says. \u201cI was drawn to marriage and still am in a lot of ways. It\u2019s not resolved. That\u2019s one of the reasons this process is so long. This is not something to take lightly.\u201d According to DeLacy, the vocation director for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, about 50% of seminarians go on to the priesthood and 50% \u201cdiscern out.\u201d They, too, though are a success in his mind, \u201cif they have greater clarity in what God\u2019s will is in their lives.\u201d A typical day during the Spiritual Year starts with prayer at 6:15 a.m. And it ends with prayer at 9 p.m., followed by silence. Interspersed there are meals, Mass, rosary, more prayer, \u201cinterior time\u201d for studying, reading, more prayer, and classroom time. They attend classes on scripture, Catechism and spiritual classics. They engage in courses on a broad range of topics including celibacy, evangelization and salvation history. The seminarians here are on a media fast \u2013 no cell phones, TV, computers or Giants for Massaro. They do have Saturdays off and get some free time each day, which is when he squeezes in a run \u2013 and another clothing change. They also must work to keep their collective home clean. As Massaro vaccums the entryway (he\u2019s now wearing sports shorts, a T-shirt and running shoes), Ryan Nguyen approaches, his hands covered in long green rubber gloves. Just weeks ago, the former pharmacist, 33, was managing 10 associates and overseeing the distribution of 2,000 prescriptions a week for Rite Aid. Now he\u2019s on a break from cleaning toilets. \u201cStaying humble,\u201d Nguyen says with a laugh. He describes himself as a \u201ccradle Catholic,\u201d born into the religion. But he came back to the faith with a full embrace about three years ago. That was when, amid doomsday talk surrounding December 21, 2012, and the Mayan calendar, he felt compelled to walk into a confessional. He\u2019s not proud of who he was then. His hair was dyed yellow. He was partying. He was dating three women at the same time, \u201clike a pimp,\u201d he says. \u201cLust,\u201d he remembers the priest telling him, \u201cis poison to the soul.\u201d They were words he says he needed to hear. Soon he found himself \u201cin love with the Blessed Mother.\u201d All of his siblings are doctors and pharmacists. Initially, they thought he was nuts. \u201cMy sister told me, \u2018You need a psychological examination,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cI was so pissed at her.\u201d But now, as he heads back to clean more toilets, he couldn\u2019t be happier. \u201cI feel like I have to pinch myself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like a dream.\u201d What Pope has said about key issues facing the church Over a communal lunch of pasta, meatballs and salad, two other seminarians chime in with snippets of their own stories. Gus deSimone, 27, was doing pro-life and chastity education before he landed here. Andrew Auletta, 22, recently graduated from Penn State. For both of them, the journey to this place was an extended process \u2013 a calling that began as a whisper, not as a sudden beckoning that arose overnight. Like Massaro, they don\u2019t credit Pope Francis for their decision. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here because of him,\u201d says deSimone. \u201cHe\u2019s more of an affirmation than a reason.\u201d Before deSimone took the leap, he remembers his grandmother saying to him, \u201cWhen are you going to find a nice girl?\u201d When he finally revealed why that wasn\u2019t going to happen, she gave him a card with a Bible quote. Auletta says his family was not surprised when he announced his intentions; only his grandfather \u2013 an ex-Catholic turned agnostic \u2013 expressed initial disappointment. More nerve-wracking for them than telling their families was sharing the news with peers. Auletta talks about the sex-abuse scandal that\u2019s dogged the church. He says he had to ask himself, \u201cAm I going to let this take me away from Christ or bring me closer?\u201d DeSimone thinks on this and invokes the saying about not throwing the baby out with the bathwater. \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cSome want to throw out the baby, but it\u2019s still a baby.\u201d And that baby \u2013 their church and faith \u2013 still needs tending to. These men, and others like them who flock to seminaries, pray to do their part. 9 quotes show Pope\u2019s reshaping of Church politics",

            "article_content": "Ismael Ozanne is the first African-American district attorney in Wisconsin history Ozanne ran for attorney general last year but came in last in the Democratic primary He is a 6th-generation Wisconsinite who hails from a pro-union, civil rights activist family Ismael Ozanne wiped a handkerchief across his forehead, nervously tapped a stack of papers on the podium and slowly cleared his throat. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d made history; that happened in 2010 when he became Wisconsin\u2019s first black district attorney. Still, the Dane County district attorney seemed acutely aware of his role on the national stage Tuesday as the man who would decide whether an officer should be charged for the March 6 shooting death of an unarmed biracial man, 19-year-old Tony Robinson. Eventually, Ozanne told reporters that he\u2019d cleared Matt Kenny of the Madison Police Department, declaring that the officer\u2019s gunfire was \u201ca lawful use of deadly police force.\u201d No charges filed against cop in death of Tony Robinson But before he revealed his long-awaited decision Tuesday, the prosecutor also made it a point to talk about his past. Ozanne is no newcomer to Wisconsin or its politics. A sixth-generation Wisconsonite, he hails from a pro-union family in an increasingly anti-union state and unsuccessfully ran for attorney general as a Democrat in last year\u2019s primary. Here are five things to know about the latest local prosecutor to garner national attention in a controversy over a police shooting: Ozanne became the first African-American district attorney in Wisconsin history in August 2010, when former Wisconsin Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, appointed him as Dane County district attorney. Ozanne\u2019s appointment filled a vacancy created when the prior DA was elected as a Court of Appeals judge. New Wisconsin protests over shooting At the time, Ozanne had been a top aide in Doyle\u2019s Cabinet, specifically in the Department of Corrections. Ozanne then ran unopposed in 2012, winning that election in the state\u2019s second largest county. Ozanne is married to Stacy Nichols Frank Ozanne, a real estate agent, and the couple have two small daughters. \u201cI am a man who understands the pain of unjustified profiling, and I am the first district attorney of color not only in Dane County, but in the state of Wisconsin,\u201d Ozanne said Tuesday. \u201cI make note of this because it is through this lens that I approach and accept my leadership responsibilities.\u201d Six generations ago, Ozanne\u2019s family arrived in Wisconsin in the late 1800s and settled in Neenah, Wisconsin, which at the time was home to flour mills, the lumber industry and paper mills. Neenah\u2019s location on the Fox River attracted those industries back then, and in fact, paper mills continue to play an important role in that city. Teen killed by officer once wrote: 'I hate my mind' Ozanne\u2019s grandfather, Robert Ozanne, was a high school teacher, a labor organizer, an author and a professor of economics at University of Wisconsin at Madison in the 1950s, according to Ismael Ozanne\u2019s biography. His parents are also teachers: His father taught at Tuskegee University in Alabama and in Madison public schools, and as of last year, his mother was still in the classroom, teaching reading at a middle school. Ozanne describes himself as biracial. \u201cI\u2019m a person of color from a biracial marriage. \u2026 I am the son of a black woman who still worries about my safety from the bias and privilege and violence that accompanies it,\u201d he said Tuesday. After graduating with his law degree from UW Madison in 1998, Ozanne began his career as a prosecutor as an assistant DA. Madison police chief: 'Life is sacred to me' While in school, Ozanne played soccer at West High School in Madison and at the state\u2019s flagship university, \u201cleading West to two state titles and lettering as a freshman for the Badgers,\u201d his biography says. As prosecutor, he initially handled civil traffic cases and then moved up to first-degree intentional homicides. For almost eight years, he handled domestic violence case, and then he was assigned felony drug cases. On Tuesday, he pointed out that he\u2019s bound to the oath he took to uphold the Constitution of the United States of America, and Wisconsin\u2019s state Constitution \u2013 and \u201ccognizant of the very real racial disparities and equity issues which exist in this county.\u201d Following in his grandfather\u2019s footsteps as an advocate for labor, Ozanne represented the Association of State Prosecutors, the union for assistant DAs, as an executive board member, a bargaining committee member and a union representative in his office. In February 2008, Doyle appointed Ozanne to be the executive assistant for the state\u2019s Department of Corrections, the largest Cabinet agency, and Ozanne worked on the department\u2019s $1.2 billion budget. Breaking down the facts of the Tony Robinson shooting A year later, Ozanne was promoted to deputy secretary, in charge of daily operations. Those posts were the No. 3 and No. 2 political appointment in the DOC, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported. In 2014, Ozanne ran for attorney general of Wisconsin but lost in the primary, coming in last among three candidates. Though a defeat, the campaign marked something of a personal family triumph. Ozanne campaigned with his mother, Gwen Gillon, who was the youngest member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the 1964 Freedom Summer. And he pointed to his mother\u2019s background with pride at Tuesday\u2019s news conference. SNCC began as a nonviolent civil rights group but later advocated greater militancy in the mid-1960s as part of the \u201cblack power\u201d movement, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Uncle of victim: 'This was an individual act' Ozanne\u2019s mother \u201cwent throughout Mississippi registering people to vote, knowing she could lose her life,\u201d Ozanne said, according to the State Journal. Ozanne cited his mother\u2019s participation in his campaign as a personal highlight. \u201cOne of the most special and sort of battery-charging things about this campaign was being able to go with my mother, who was in 1964, the youngest member of SNCC, at 17, going through Mississippi, registering people to vote, risking her life,\u201d Ozanne told supporters after losing last year\u2019s primary, according to the Isthmus news outlet in Madison. CNN\u2019s Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The trials of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Aaron Hernandez are coming to a close Voting has put Rahm Emanuel and Ferguson, Missouri, back in the headlines Rand Paul has announced his bid for the presidency The nation\u2019s top stories will be unfolding Tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country. Massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory \u2013 those of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Both lengthy trials are coming to a close. In Louisville, Kentucky, Sen. Rand Paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president, while in Chicago, voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and challenger Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia. And in Ferguson, Missouri, the shadow of Michael Brown and the protests over his shooting by Officer Darren Wilson will loom large over the city\u2019s elections. Here\u2019s a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here: Davis: The death penalty is called for in Tsarnaev case Tsarnaev, who\u2019s accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 Boston Marathon along with his now-deceased brother, faces the stiffest of penalties \u2013 life in prison or the death penalty \u2013 if he\u2019s found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him, including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. The 13th juror: What defense? On Monday, survivors and victims\u2019 families wept and Tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old \u201cbrought terrorism into the backyards and main streets.\u201d The jury on Tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges, before the so-called penalty phase, should he be found guilty on any counts. Patriots owner: Aaron Hernandez said he was innocent It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd, yet on Monday, Hernandez\u2019s defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day. Closing arguments are scheduled for Tuesday, and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter. Jurors in Fall River, Massachusetts, will be asked to decide if Hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of Lloyd, whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013. Much of the evidence against Hernandez is circumstantial, and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s testimony, the testimony of Hernandez\u2019s fiancee, some grainy footage from Hernandez\u2019s home security system and a footprint left by a Nike Air Jordan shoe. Hernandez known for swagger, even in court Rand Paul to launch 2016 run today OK, sure, no one was floored when the Kentucky senator announced his bid for the Oval Office, but of course it was news when he made it official Tuesday. Paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada. The physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the Senate in 2010, where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism, and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House. Paul and Sen. Ted Cruz are the only declared candidates for the GOP nomination, though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of Florida\u2019s Jeb Bush, New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie, Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker, South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham and Florida\u2019s Marco Rubio. Would Rand be here without Ron? Underdog vies to take Chicago mayoral race It\u2019s the Windy City\u2019s first runoff for a citywide office, and it\u2019s being billed as a battle for the \u201cfuture of Chicago.\u201d In one corner, you have Emanuel, President Barack Obama\u2019s notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff, and in the other, you have Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia, a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal Democrats\u2019 frustrations with the Chicago incumbent. After Emanuel failed to snare half the vote in February\u2019s general election, he will go head-to-head with Garcia. The timing is interesting, too, as Easter, Passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes, up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in February. Change is in the air for Ferguson City Council Following Michael Brown\u2019s death, the national spotlight shone on Ferguson, particularly how the city\u2019s predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and City Council. Yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership, only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in November to cast ballots. Residents speak out ahead of vote Tuesday\u2019s election will bring change, no matter how the ballots are cast: Two black men are running for one of the open seats, and the current lone black council member isn\u2019t up for re-election. In another ward, two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat. And a white protester is running for a third post.",

            "article_content": "Watch the CNN Republican debate Tuesday, December 15 at 6:00 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. ET. Ted Cruz has overtaken Donald Trump in recent Iowa polls Neither man is the favorite of the Republican establishment but they are pulling away from the other contenders Call it the Republican establishment\u2019s nightmare scenario. The GOP establishment, confronted by a recalcitrant electorate that refuses to leave Donald Trump, is being forced to take a fresh look at Ted Cruz, a man with grassroots strength in key early primary states and few friends in Washington. Suddenly, the Republican Party\u2019s best hope could be a man hell-bent on transforming it: a senator who openly spars with fellow GOP colleagues, and has campaigned by painting its leaders as spineless and feeble. READ: Poll: Clinton beating Trump, Cruz but not Rubio Headed into Tuesday\u2019s CNN Republican presidential debate, Cruz and Trump have turned Iowa into a two-man race, with the Texan leading in two new polls. Cruz is up 31% to Trump\u2019s 21% among likely GOP caucus-goers, according to the Bloomberg Politics-Des Moines Register poll released Saturday. A Fox News poll Sunday has Cruz leading Trump 28% to 26%. A small and growing number of Republicans allied with the establishment \u2013 the force long thought to quickly consolidate against a surging Cruz bid \u2013 are coming to terms with the idea that he may be palatable in an election cycle where Trump has pushed the envelope well beyond what they considered acceptable. \u201cOh God, yes,\u201d said Ed Rogers, a top Republican lobbyist, when asked if he\u2019d prefer Cruz. \u201cCompared to Trump, he\u2019s OK.\u201d Read: Stage set for final GOP debate of 2015 Establishment Republicans had enough of a problem when Trump began his populist-fueled move to the top of national polls, where he has stubbornly remained for five months. But Cruz\u2019s steady rise means that even if Trump were taken out by a well-financed negative campaign, they might have to deal with a stronger Cruz, who has more political polish than the more improvisational Trump. \u201cIf you talk to my peers around town, collectively it\u2019s an appreciation the guy is smart as hell,\u201d explained a senior Washington Republican who is backing another candidate. \u201cHe can be a more acceptable alternative to Trump, if it comes to that.\u201d The irony hasn\u2019t escaped them. Said the Republican: \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting life \u2013 and everything\u2019s relative.\u201d Most establishment Republicans have been drawn to the half-dozen candidates who come from that wing of the party, especially Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has lived in the mid-teens in most polls, and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has dropped down to 3% nationally. But given Cruz\u2019s surging poll numbers and Trump\u2019s remarkable political durability, some wonder if it could be Cruz that emerges as the compromise candidate. Moments from Ted Cruz's career \u201cThe second he starts to look like a winner in Washington,\u201d Rogers said, \u201che\u2019s going to have a bunch of new friends.\u201d It\u2019s a dilemma swatted away on Capitol Hill \u2013 perhaps optimistically. Asked about choosing Trump or Cruz, 2008 nominee Sen. John McCain would only allow that they are \u201csmart people.\u201d Bush backer Sen. Susan Collins would just offer that they are \u201cobviously not my choice.\u201d And there\u2019s no guarantee either one can beat Hillary Clinton. \u201cHe\u2019s not as outrageous as Trump, but I don\u2019t know that he\u2019s any more electable than Trump,\u201d said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Republican presidential campaigns for over two decades. Brian Walsh, a longtime Senate campaign aide, said it\u2019s an out-of-control Trump \u2013 not an in-control Cruz \u2013 that explains the Texan\u2019s growing appeal. \u201cTrump has gone so far that it has in some ways masked how problematic Cruz would be as the nominee as well,\u201d he said. Read: Trump and Cruz tangle on Twitter Pro-Clinton super PAC sends Trump hats to GOP candidates Despite his background as an Ivy League-educated attorney and his time in the Bush administration, Cruz rose to prominence as a tea party darling who became the national face of the 2013 government shutdown. Cruz has spent the two years since working to salvage his relationship with some potential investors in his campaign, but he has reveled in his image as a Washington bad boy, the only senator willing to do on Capitol Hill what he campaigned on back at home. It\u2019s something that has made him enemies in Washington, where he has not convinced a single Senate colleague to back his campaign. Cruz helped push Republicans to shut down the government in a high-stakes fight over Obamacare, a strategy that failed to get results but didn\u2019t cause a predicted electoral meltdown. On the trail, he has shown no willingness to moderate his positions, bragging about his conservative purity and his rabble-rousing reputation in the Capitol. Read: Pro-Clinton super PAC sends Trump hats to GOP 2016ers But even compared to Cruz\u2019s burn-it-down rhetoric, Trump\u2019s campaign has been more incendiary and worrisome for party elders determined to beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The mogul had harsh things to say about Hispanics, prisoners of war, women in the media, the disabled, and most recently, Muslims, who he thinks temporarily should not be allowed to enter the United States. And most concerning for GOP leaders, Trump has frequently floated leaving the Republican Party altogether to mount an independent bid, which would significantly increase Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the White House. The pair appears to be heading toward a clash that Cruz, at least, long sought to delay. On Friday evening, about 24 hours after audio leaked of Cruz questioning Trump\u2019s judgment at a private fundraiser, the real estate mogul launched his first attacks on Cruz. Cruz had attempted to head that off by alleging that mainstream Republicans were trying to sow discord. \u201cThe Establishment\u2019s only hope: Trump & me in a cage match,\u201d he tweeted Friday morning. \u201cSorry to disappoint \u2014 @realdonaldtrump is terrific. #DealWithIt\u201d Cruz has done little to woo the Republicans he used as his bogeyman: He has raised the lion\u2019s share of his money far from the New York-to-Washington corridor, raced to the party\u2019s right flank on every issue of the day, and campaigned loudly on the polarizing social issues that one well-placed Republican said puts some contributors permanently out of reach. Read: Trump: \u2018I have far better judgment\u2019 than Cruz Cruz, on paper, should not be as repellent to the GOP political class as he is. Nurtured by the George W. Bush network in Texas, he served as solicitor general before winning an upset bid in the 2012 Republican U.S. Senate primary. To Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign, that resume should theoretically make him attractive to the party\u2019s elite. \u201cAt a core of Cruz\u2019s candidacy is a great phonyism,\u201d Stevens said of the self-stylized insurgent. \u201cYou can wear all the plaid shirts and shoot off all the automatic weapons you want, but you\u2019re an insider.\u201d And some of his positions, such as on national security, do hew closely to the party\u2019s center. As Cruz held court on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe\u201d last week, \u201cyou could\u2019ve sworn he was working for George Herbert Walker Bush on his foreign policy,\u201d a senior Republican said. But a leading Republican in frequent touch with high-level donors, said even though those contributors may despise Cruz, they are learning to live with him. \u201cIf that\u2019s what we need to do to beat Trump,\u201d the Republican said, \u201cthen that\u2019s what you get.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this story",

Trump also attacked Graham\u2019s foreign policy Thursday, questioning the war veteran\u2019s plans in defeating ISIS. Graham has had a contentious relationship with Trump since he decided to run for president. Most notably, Trump revealed Graham\u2019s personal cell phone number during a press conference this summer, leading Graham to publicly destroy his phone. But Graham said Friday that Trump is in no position to question anyone\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cDonald Trump is the most uninformed person I\u2019ve ever met running for president when it comes to foreign policy. He has no clue what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d he said. \u201cDo not replace Barack Obama with Donald Trump.

He has no idea what he\u2019s talking about,\u201d Graham added. \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is going to hurt us for generations to come with Hispanics.\u201d Graham told Republican voters Friday at the Sunshine Summit that Republicans need to be proactive in connecting with minority communities. \u201cTo those who say Republicans have to be socially liberal to win an election \u2013 you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re re talking about,\u201d he said in Orlando, Florida. \u201cRepublicans have to reach out to faith-based minorities who share our values and form a coalition.\u201d The South Carolina senator said the values of many Hispanics would fit with the Republican Party. \u201cThey\u2019re entrepreneurial.

            "article_content": "Carly Fiorina ran for the Senate in 2010 during a year in which Republicans won many races Her loss offers lessons as she rises to the top of the 2016 GOP pack Carly Fiorina is surprising many Republicans with her meteoric rise to the top tier of the 2016 GOP race. But here in California, her sparkling performances on the campaign trail look more like a case of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Before plummeting to a 10-percentage-point loss during a wave year for Republicans in 2010, the former chief executive mounted a fierce challenge to U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer with all of the same assets she is displaying now. She dazzled voters, particularly women, with her secretary-to-CEO life narrative. She impressed them with her toughness \u2013 from her well-placed jabs at Boxer to her own gutsy story as a breast cancer survivor. She demonstrated a brilliant ability to synthesize complex issues into sound bites, even if critics often took issue with the way she framed the facts. But the 2010 race offered a window into something else: the ease of constructing a brutal and relentless takedown of the one-time Hewlett-Packard chief executive that could well be repeated in the presidential cycle. The anti-Fiorina playbook in California packed a powerful one-two punch: pairing the stories of dismissed H-P workers with details of her compensation package and luxurious CEO \u201cperks\u201d \u2013 from private jets to yachts \u2013 defining her as the face of corporate greed. RELATED: In Iowa, lines blurred between Fiorina campaign and super PAC The attacks were particularly potent, because opponents used Fiorina\u2019s own words against her, plucking damaging quotes from the vast trove of video that comprises her business career. \u201cEarly on, we were very concerned,\u201d said Boxer\u2019s lead strategist, Rose Kapolczynski, recalling her alarm when she first experienced Fiorina\u2019s powerful appeal to moderate women of all political parties in early focus groups. \u201cSome voters found her so appealing that when we told them about her laying off workers, they didn\u2019t believe us. They\u2019d say \u2018She wouldn\u2019t do that.\u2019 \u201c Facing that disbelief in an election climate favoring Republicans, the Boxer team set out on an intensive scrub of Fiorina\u2019s business record, sifting through her countless interviews, speeches and public statements. \u201cWe worked hard to find video of her talking about layoffs and shipping jobs overseas,\u201d Kapolczynski said, \u201cbecause that was the proof point \u2013 that we aren\u2019t making this up; it isn\u2019t a political attack; it is her in her own words.\u201d \u201cWe barely scratched the surface,\u201d said Kapolczynki said, looking back at the campaign where Boxer spent nearly $28 million to Fiorina\u2019s $22 million. Fiorina\u2019s record at H-P is already a major issue in the 2016 Republican campaign. Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner, slammed her tenure at CNN\u2019s Republican presidential debate earlier this month. \u201cThe company is a disaster and continues to be a disaster,\u201d Trump said. Asked about the criticism of Fiorina\u2019s corporate record in 2010 and how the campaign would handle H-P related attacks this cycle, a Fiorina spokeswoman referred calls to former Iowa House Speaker Christopher Rants, a senior adviser to the campaign, who noted that an increasing number of Fiorina\u2019s colleagues were coming forward to tell the positive side of her H-P legacy. \u201cThere\u2019s a compelling story to tell,\u201d he said. On Wednesday, a Fiorina spokeswoman also emailed a compilation of quotes from Fiorina\u2019s co-workers at H-P and AT&T praising her vision, insights and compassion, which the campaign assembled into a post on Medium. Five years after her failed Senate bid, Fiorina is trying to transform her presidential campaign from upstart to that of a party standard bearer. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of the GOP race released this week, Fiorina tied for third place with Marco Rubio at 11%. She didn\u2019t register at all in the same poll in July. As she rises, Fiorina is facing a critical test: offering a more compelling defense of her H-P record to prove to donors and GOP voters that she is the strongest contender to face off against Hillary Clinton. Largely through the help of an allied super PAC, the CARLY For America committee, there are signs of a more proactive effort to take control of the H-P narrative than in 2010, when Fiorina\u2019s campaign manager, Martin Wilson, often told reporters that you couldn\u2019t win a campaign \u201con defense.\u201d In recent weeks, former employees supportive of Fiorina have come forward in carefully placed op-eds to praise her achievements and her effort to shake up what they described as a slumbering culture at H-P (unfortunately for Fiorina, those efforts coincided with a fresh round of layoffs at the tech giant). The super PAC website dedicated to describing her journey \u2013 fromsecretarytoceo.com \u2013 is also soliciting personal stories under the banner \u201cHave you worked with Carly? Tell your story.\u201d Is America ready for a CEO president? When asked about the differences between 2010 and 2016, Rants said many of those favorable stories would emerge to bolster Fiorina\u2019s case. He pointed in particular to the testimony of former H-P board member Tom Perkins, who Fiorina once accused of orchestrating her ouster from H-P. In full-page letter published as an ad in The New York Times by the pro-Fiorina super PAC, Perkins countered those who claim she was fired at HP because she was \u201cunsuccessful.\u201d Instead, Perkins said the board was \u201cineffective and dysfunctional\u201d and wrong to fire her \u2013 a description Fiorina has neatly framed herself in her stump speech line that she was \u201cfired in a boardroom brawl.\u201d \u201cWe are making sure that the truth gets out, that the actual record is in context,\u201d Rants said.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the story out, shame on us. But if we do our job, then I think people will understand that she was brought in to be a change agent; that it was a rocky time for the economy and the tech industry as a whole; and that the company grew \u2013 and because of what she did, they\u2019re actually in decent shape.\u201d Fiorina\u2019s record at H-P only became the dominant issue during the general election in 2010. It didn\u2019t draw as much attention during her primary campaign. Running as a staunchly pro-life conservative, she was not well known in California and ran fairly evenly against her two underwhelming and underfunded Republican opponents: Orange County Assemblyman Chuck DeVore and California Rep. Tom Campbell, a law professor who had advanced controversial ideas such as distributing heroin to heroin addicts in an effort to reduce crime and drug addiction. Fiorina downplays her insider credentials on the trail While Democrats would later use Fiorina\u2019s wealth as part of their attack against her, Republican voters keen on ousting Boxer viewed it as a sign of her wherewithal in an expensive California campaign. (At the time of her 2005 firing from H-P, Fiorina received more than $21 million in severance, and the financial disclosure forms that she filed with the Senate Ethics Committee in 2009 showed an asset range for Fiorina and her husband of between $27.7 million and $121 million). Carly Fiorina's political career By loaning her campaign $5.5 million, Fiorina ramped up her television presence in the final phase of the campaign and easily dispatched her opponents \u2013 helped, in part, by a late endorsement from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Boxer, a polarizing figure whose approval ratings had dipped at times below 40%, appeared ripe for a challenge. Shortly before the California primary in 2010, only 34% of voters said they wanted to re-elect the three-term incumbent in a University of Southern California/Los Angeles Times poll, while 49% said they wanted to elect someone else. Fiorina rose to the challenge. With the economy still recovering from a recession, she filleted Boxer as a feckless and unimaginative bureaucrat who had presided over a bloated bureaucracy while acting \u201caccountable to no one\u201d during 28 years in office. She used many of the same talking points about her H-P tenure that she does today: that she doubled the company\u2019s revenue and employment under her watch (a result of the controversial merger with Compaq Computer Corp. in 2002).  She was self-assured and unapologetic, never seeming to second-guess her actions during her six years at H-P. Fiorina defends waterboarding Still, her campaign couldn\u2019t stay on offense. The roiling debate over Fiorina\u2019s tenure and the circumstances of her firing raised questions for voters about her competency. But it was the stories from former employees that dealt the most devastating blow, by putting a human face to her history of presiding over 30,000 layoffs and her unapologetic embrace of the offshoring of those jobs to other countries. \u201cWhile Californians lost their jobs, Fiorina tripled her salary, bought a million-dollar yacht and five corporate jets,\u201d one of the ads said. \u201cCarly Fiorina. Outsourcing jobs. Out for herself.\u201d The ad did not mention that in the process of acquiring five corporate jets while Fiorina was chief executive, H-P retired four jets. Fiorina had many defenders, but their vigor seemed outmatched by the passion of the employees she dismissed. Those workers regularly called reporters and pro-actively sought out the campaigns of her opponents, offering to tell their stories, and seeking to portray her as a ruthless self-promoter who had destroyed the famed culture of H-P. The campaign ads featuring ordinary H-P workers who had been laid off were so effective that the Boxer campaign never felt the need to turn to the alternative lines of attack in their arsenal. In one spot, Boxer\u2019s ad makers stitched together the accounts of workers speaking to camera, recounting how they had planned to retire at the company. \u201cShe shipped our jobs to China,\u201d one employee identified as Teri said. \u201cAnd India,\u201d an employee identified as Farrell added. \u201cI had to pack my bags \u2013 and I was out the door that night,\u201d a third employee said. The ads, Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said, were so effective because they turned Fiorina\u2019s greatest strength into her greatest weakness. Why Fiorina has quieted her attacks against Clinton Even Fiorina\u2019s former foes do not rule out the possibility that she could seize the Republican nomination, but they foresee a rough road for her campaign ahead. In a replay of 2010 history, one rival campaign has already fielded offers from fired H-P workers to tell their stories on camera, according to a campaign aide with knowledge of those conversations. The aide couldn\u2019t speak for attribution because of the sensitivity surrounding the discussion. Wilson, Fiorina\u2019s former campaign manager, said her detractors are underestimating her potential to overcome those kinds of obstacles, particularly in a campaign where she will have more resources to tell her story. \u201cShe was a very good candidate in 2010, and she\u2019s a better candidate now,\u201d he said. \u201cHer ability to crisply deliver a message hasn\u2019t subsided; she\u2019s upped her game. She\u2019s taken it to places I didn\u2019t know she had in her \u2013 maybe she didn\u2019t know. You don\u2019t until you get out there and push yourself.\u201d And it is unclear whether a national audience will have the same reaction to Fiorina\u2019s H-P tenure as voters did in California. Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California, noted that Fiorina\u2019s challenge in 2010 was to convince large numbers of Democratic voters not to vote for a Democrat \u2013 in effect to stay home. \u201cThat was a very tough hill to climb in deep-blue California,\u201d Schnur said. \u201cEven in a general election campaign, she\u2019d be talking to a much more ideologically diverse electorate. Whether in a primary or a general election, she\u2019s certainly going to face very difficult questions about her record at Hewlett-Packard, but a national electorate might not be as predisposed to reject her argument.\u201d Fiorina pushes for Keystone pipeline, draws contrast with Clinton",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump has been inspiring comedians since before he launched his presidential bid, but now one comic has put the larger-than-life campaign to music. Comedian and two-time Miami Beach mayoral candidate Steve Berke croons that Trump is \u201cin your head\u201d in his in his latest parody music video posted online Tuesday, which also features a cameo from Trump\u2019s former political adviser Roger Stone, who makes a Nixonian peace sign salute and closes out the video. Berke wrote the song, setting it to the tune of The Presidents of the United States of America\u2019s \u201cLump,\u201d an infectious song Berke said he couldn\u2019t shake, making it perfect for a Trump parody. Stone\u2019s appearance in the video isn\u2019t the only nexus between Berke and the billionaire presidential candidate: Like Trump, Berke was advised during his own political campaign by Stone, the former Richard Nixon acolyte known for his media savvy who until last month advised Trump\u2019s flirtation with presidential politics for nearly two decades. \u201cHe was my senior political adviser much like he was to Donald Trump,\u201d Berke said. \u201cEven before Roger was in the news, when Trump\u2019s campaign was in its infancy, I was telling everyone this has got Roger. It smells of Roger.\u201d RELATED: Trump campaign claims it fired top adviser \u2013 who says he quit Like the chorus to the song, Berke himself hasn\u2019t been able to get Trump out of his head since the presidential candidate\u2019s behavior at the first GOP primary debate, and the video captures everything that\u2019s made Donald Trump such a political and media sensation: From his brazen demeanor to the unabashed opulence. The video opens with a man-in-drag re-enacting Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly questioning Trump at the GOP debate about his disparaging comments about women. The response is even more Trumpian than Trump\u2019s \u201cJust Rosie O\u2019Donnell\u201d retort as Berke, dressed as Trump, shoots dollar bills into the air. But Berke isn\u2019t just looking to milk Trump\u2019s candidacy for its comedic value \u2014 or hits on his YouTube account. He\u2019s genuinely intrigued. \u201cHe\u2019s changed the public discourse in this election \u2026 he\u2019s motivated young people in this primary to pay attention a year in advance,\u201d Berke said. \u201cI support his candidacy because he is the anti-politician and because he is forcing people to  look at issues that weren\u2019t previously being looked at.\u201d That\u2019s not an endorsement, Berke insists, but he is \u201cabsolutely\u201d considering voting for Trump, though it\u2019s too early to tell, he said. There is something about Trump\u2019s campaign that reminds Berke of his first campaign for Miami Beach mayor in 2011, albeit on a much smaller scale. Berke\u2019s mayoral campaign, launched largely as a joke and as a platform to push his pro-marijuana legalization views, quickly morphed into a serious effort whose unorthodoxy drew national media attention. Berke didn\u2019t reach out to the Trump campaign as he produced the video, instead pulling off the project with his friends in just one week, hoping to push the video before the next GOP debate in just two weeks. Berke has high hopes for the video: \u201cWe plan on breaking the internet,\u201d he declared. For a YouTuber whose most popular parody video \u201cPot Shop,\u201d inspired by Macklemores\u2019 \u201cThrift Shop,\u201d racked up more than 14 million views on YouTube, that might not be so far-flung.",

            "article_content": "Democratic power brokers gathered in Minneapolis for their annual meeting Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley and Lincoln Chafee addressed the meeting Hillary Clinton continued to tie Donald Trump to the rest of his party Friday, using a fiery speech at the Democratic National Committee\u2019s summer meeting on Friday to slam the Republican front-runner. In a long riff about the real estate mogul, Clinton blasted the party for getting away from its founding principles. \u201cThe party of Lincoln has become the party of Trump,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton blasted Trump for arguing that he would be better than she on dealing with women\u2019s health issues. \u201cNow, that is a general election debate that is going to be a lot of fun,\u201d she said to a markedly pro-Clinton audience. Stickers with Clinton\u2019s \u201cH\u201d logo were ever-present and the American Federation of Teachers stacked the area of the event open to the public with 75 Clinton supporters in T-shirts that read, \u201cAFT For Hillary 2016.\u201d At multiple times during the speech, the audience broke out into chants of \u201cHillary, Hillary.\u201d In addition focusing on Republicans, the message of Clinton\u2019s visit was clear: She won\u2019t make the mistakes she made in 2008. Clinton promised the state Democratic leaders and party operatives that she would be their \u201cpartner every step of the way\u201d in rebuilding the Democratic Party, adding that her work would not just be on winning the White House and Congress, but also statehouses across the country. In a conversation with reporters after her speech, Clinton acknowledged the importance super delegates, party activists, leaders and elected officials whose support counts to the eventual delegate count that decides the party\u2019s nominee. Clinton\u2019s failed 2008 campaign was plagued by poor delegate counting and it was not uncommon for Clinton to win the popular vote in a state but lose the delegate count. \u201cAs some of you might recall, in 2008, I got a lot of votes but I didn\u2019t get enough delegates,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd so I think it is understandable that my focus is going to be on delegates, as well as votes, this time.\u201d Clinton added, \u201cWe are working really hard to lock in as many supporters as possible. Of course that would include super delegates. \u2026 I am heartened by the positive response I am getting.\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign has brought a sizable team to Minneapolis to do just that. In addition to the aides who regularly travel with her, Robby Mook, her campaign manager, Marlon Marshall, the campaign\u2019s director of state campaigns and political engagement, Marc Elias, the campaign\u2019s lawyer, and Charle Baker, the campaign\u2019s chief administrative officer, are all at the DNC meeting to help convince delegates to commit to Clinton. The campaign is already hyper-focused on the number of super delegates \u2013 party activists, leaders and elected officials whose support counts to the eventual delegate count that decides the party\u2019s nominee \u2013 that have endorsed the former secretary of state. Clinton and her top aides receive daily briefings that tally their super delegates, and Mook said Friday that Clinton aides feel very confident in their super delegate strength. Clinton was not the only candidate in Minnesota on Friday, however. Part team building, part pep-rally, the meeting was an opportunity for Clinton, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee to reach out to people who, come 2016, will be considered coveted endorsements. Sanders, an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats in Washington and is seeking the party\u2019s presidential nomination, took his fiery anti-establishment rhetoric to the most establishment Democratic meeting in the country Friday. \u201cDemocrats will not retain the White House, will not regain the Senate or the U.S. House, will not be successful in dozens of governors races all across this country, unless we generated excitement ad momentum and produce a huge voter turnout,\u201d he said. \u201cThat turnout, that enthusiasm, will not happen with politics as usual.\u201d He added, \u201cThe same old, same old, will not work.\u201d RELATED: Hillary Clinton: \u2018The hair is real, the color isn\u2019t.\u2019 This setting is unfamiliar terrain for Sanders: He told reporters that this was the first time he has ever addressed a DNC meeting and that the only convention he attended was in 2008. O\u2019Malley used his 15-minute speech to blast the number of presidential debates the Democratic National Committee has organized, telling the very party officials who made the decision that the number of debates are \u201cundemocratic.\u201d \u201cIs this how the Democratic Party selects its nominee, or are we becoming something else, something less?\u201d he said. DNC officials say it is highly unlikely that the party sanctions any more debates, even with O\u2019Malley\u2019s complaints. It is also unlikely, they say, that the party will lower their strict rules about participating in unsanctioned DNC debates. Speaking with reporters after his speech, O\u2019Malley flatly said \u201cyes\u201d when asked whether the debate schedule outlined by the DNC is aimed at helping Clinton. Chafee, a former Republican senator and independent governor, spoke before Clinton, delivering a far more subdued speech that was not well received. Chafee noted during his speech that in 30 years of public life, he \u201chas had no scandals.\u201d Many of the DNC members took that at a shot at Clinton, who has been dogged by controversies and scandals for much of her career. There were audible boos from the audience. Chafee, however, told reporters after the speech that the line was not aimed at Clinton. Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb did not speak at the event. He informed the DNC last week that he would be seeing his daughter off to college on Friday and unable to make it to Minneapolis. \u201cWe saw no plan offered by DNC officials for meaningful interaction with their members,\u201d said Craig Crawford, Webb\u2019s spokesman. \u201cTime-limited 10-minute speeches and a hospitality room? Direct mail vendors probably get more exposure.\u201d Candidates like Webb and O\u2019Malley have openly complained about the DNC\u2019s ties to the Clinton campaign. Those complaints grew louder on Thursday when the DNC and Clinton\u2019s team signed a joint fundraising agreement, allowing the Democratic frontrunner to raise money for the party. Although a DNC spokesperson said they hope to sign similar deals with other campaigns, none have yet. \u201cThe Democratic National Committee,\u201d said Crawford, \u201cis like watching another really poor parody of The Sopranos.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It was a huge win for President Barack Obama but, as is so often the case in polarized Washington, it may just be a prelude to a bigger battle ahead. Congress finally granted the president fast-track trade authority on Wednesday, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the Republican who once plotted to deny him reelection, saved a centerpiece of the president\u2019s second term by forcing a bill opposed by most Democrats through the Senate. The vote revived Obama\u2019s trade agenda, was a lifeline for his signature Asia \u201cpivot\u201d policy \u2013 for which the vast trade pact in the works is crucial \u2013 and was a rare instance of leaders working across the aisle. READ: Senate sends key trade bill to Obama But opponents of the Pacific Rim trade pact, known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, are promising to muster a growing coalition of union, environmental and community groups to heap pressure on lawmakers who will now face a vote on ratifying it in the volatile political atmosphere of the 2016 election campaign. That\u2019s also bad news for Hillary Clinton. The front-running Democrat was an architect of the TPP as secretary of state but has taken on the skepticism of many liberals towards big trade deals since she started running for president amid a populist economic storm. Obama himself fought a ferocious legislative duel that estranged him from some of his closest allies in his own party in order to get it through. Still, on Thursday, the passage of trade promotion authority \u2013 which gives Obama the power to submit trade deals to Congress for an up-or-down vote, seen as essential to getting such pacts approved \u2013 was a novel break with Capitol Hill\u2019s habitual inertia. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy. Many thought it would never happen,\u201d McConnell said. White House officials spun the vote as a victory for almost extinct bipartisanship, despite the failure of the bulk of Democrats to sign on and the stunning and uncomfortable showdown between Obama and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi over the measure. White House spokesman Josh Earnest hailed \u201cRepublican majorities in Congress working closely with Democratic minorities in Congress to build bipartisan support for legislation that then arrives on the desk of a Democratic president.\u201d He added, \u201cThat is the way the legislative policymaking process in Washington is supposed to work in an era of divided government.\u201d Key trade bill passes the Senate Privately, there was satisfaction among White House aides that just a few days after many in the media wrote obituaries for Obama\u2019s trade agenda and, not for the first time, proclaimed him a lame duck, he was able to wrack up another big victory for presidential power. Had the fast-track provision crashed, U.S. partners in the Pacific, including Japan, would never have accepted tough political concessions on market access required by the TPP and the deal would have died, likely taking U.S. credibility in Asia and Obama\u2019s pivot to the region with it. Now, Obama\u2019s trade negotiators can pursue a final agreement on a deal involving 12 nations accounting for 40 percent of global GDP that would significantly enhance his political legacy. The deal\u2019s survival also means Obama will be at center stage in Washington fighting for a major legislative priority right until the waning months of his second term, at a time when many presidents have already run out of steam and domestic clout. He will have little choice but to wage an intense campaign to convince the American people of the TPP\u2019s merits. Still, final passage of any TPP deal is no sure thing \u2013 and not just because Obama will be low on leverage at the end of his mandate. Supporters of the TPP hoped that they could get Congress to sign off on the pact before the notion of global trade gets caught in the inevitable election-year backlash against Wall Street, corporations and low-wage economies overseas that have syphoned jobs from rust belt swing states in the Midwest and elsewhere. But now, lawmakers will be asked to take a tough vote that could expose them to attacks from opponents of the deal. TPP nations may ink a final agreement at a ministerial meeting this summer and could present the deal as the highlight of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum later this year. But there\u2019s no guarantee the fragile coalition assembled by Obama and McConnell \u2013 mostly Republican but bolstered by pro-trade Democrats \u2013 will survive. And the clock is ticking. \u201cI am very doubtful we can have a ratification vote before the end of this year,\u201d said Mireya Solis, a specialist on Japanese economic policy at the Brookings Institution. \u201cWe are thinking this is going to spill over to 2016 and this opens up all kinds of interesting possibilities.\u201d READ: How secretive is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? Between now and then, Obama must work hard to repair ties with Democrats on Capitol Hill. More mastery of Senate procedure will also likely be required from McConnell, who secured support for the fast-track authority only after promising to adopt a workers\u2019 assistance bill Republicans largely disparaged but Democrats demanded. The wily Senate leader\u2019s normal antipathy to Obama\u2019s priorities was overcome because Republicans generally still firmly back free trade \u2013 and he was keen to use the fast-track vote to convince voters in 2016 that the GOP has delivered results and deserves to keep its slim Senate majority. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed working with the president on this issue,\u201d McConnell said on Tuesday in an incongruous show of warmth, five years after he told National Journal the most important GOP achievement would be \u201cfor President Obama to be a one-term president.\u201d \u201cHopefully, we can find some other things that we can agree on to work on together during his remaining year-and-a-half in office. \u201c Few in Washington will be holding their breath, given the scorched-earth policy McConnell has adopted towards Obama and the president\u2019s own clear disdain for Congress as a whole \u2013 not just the Republicans who run it. While Obama and McConnell can claim a share of the spoils, the big loser could be Hillary Clinton. The debate over fast-track has put Clinton in a dicey political spot given her past support for the TPP, which she once called the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade agreements. Since then Clinton, already facing suspicion among Democratic primary voters about her links to Wall Street and big business, has rowed back \u2013 insisting that Congress should use the fast-track authority as leverage to getting a better TPP arrangement. If a final TPP deal is agreed to, the lengthy ratification process will likely mean Clinton is stuck with the issue through the Democratic primary season. Wherever she comes down on TPP, she would be open to dreaded charges of flip-flopping by Republicans, which could exacerbate questions of trust in her character that have emerged in recent opinion polls. Here's why the TPP is such a big deal And TPP opponents will not make her life any easier. \u201cWe feel emboldened after this fight. We see fast-track as a momentary loss and feel really confident about attacking the TPP head on,\u201d said Ilana Solomon, director of the Sierra Club\u2019s Responsible Trade Program. \u201cThere is going to be an even bigger fight about stopping the TPP,\u201d said Solomon, who like many opponents believes that when the TPP\u2019s secret provisions are revealed when the final agreement is struck by the U.S. and its Pacific partners, it will prove their case that the deal empowers corporations at the expense of American workers. Some TPP opponents believe the backlash could force the White House and Republicans to delay ratification until a lame-duck session of Congress after the November 2016 election. And RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of the National Nurses United union, which also opposes the TPP, predicted that support for the pact could be incompatible with an election in which economic inequality and the power of corporations will be driving issues. \u201cThis is a betrayal at the highest levels. These folks that voted with the President have spoken very clearly,\u201d she said. \u201cYou had to choose here. This was pretty black and white. You are with us or against us. Us is the American people. They chose Wall Street.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A small group of 2016 presidential contenders took turns Friday making their pitch to a large gathering of South Carolina\u2019s Republican activists, keenly aware of the state\u2019s first-in-the-South primary status. While Ted Cruz, Rick Perry and Rick Santorum competed for the audience\u2019s love, it was South Carolina\u2019s own senator, Lindsey Graham, who easily carried the night at the state GOP\u2019s annual Silver Elephant Dinner in Columbia, dropping serious hints about his own potential White House bid and entertaining the crowd with his witty string of one-liners. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be home with people who talk like I do,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThe next President of the United States should have an accent. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019m going to say about that.\u201d RELATED: Rubio leads GOP field in national poll Graham, who was first elected to the Senate in 2002 after representing the state in the House for seven years, went through rounds of thanks to the state\u2019s elected officials and widely-known public figures before offering praise of the three presidential hopefuls who preceded him. He described Cruz as \u201cvery funny\u201d and \u201cenergetic,\u201d while Perry, he said, was a \u201cjob-creating juggernaut\u201d in Texas. As for Santorum, the former Pennsylvania senator, there\u2019s \u201cno stronger voice for the unborn,\u201d Graham said. 2016 GOPers' foreign policy credentials One of the most outspoken Republicans on issue of national defense, the senator also teased a preview of his own presidential aspirations with a word of advice: \u201cGet ready.\u201d \u201cGet ready for a debate that\u2019s been long overdue in the party,\u201d said Graham, a colonel in the Air Force Reserve. \u201cGet ready for a voice that understands you can\u2019t save America without somebody willing to sacrifice and die for America.\u201d \u201cTo our enemies, get ready because there\u2019s a new way of doing business coming,\u201d he continued. \u201cTo our friends, get ready for the America that you used to know. To Iowa and New Hampshire, hello. To South Carolina, you have my heart.\u201d While Graham barely registers in recent 2016 polls, his speech nonetheless drew the crowd of close to a 1,000 to its feet. Also Friday night, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus delivered a pep talk with some tough love on how the GOP can do better in the next presidential race. He blasted the last process as a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d because of what he called the \u201c23-debate traveling circus\u201d and criticized the GOP for becoming \u201ca candidate-crazy party to the detriment of all the mechanics.\u201d RELATED: GOP field heavy on hawks, light on experience Priebus has worked to sharply limit the number of primary debates that will take place over the next year and move up the national convention so the nominee can have more time as a general election candidate. The RNC has also invested heavily in boosting its data-driven strategies and outreach to nontraditional Republicans. \u201cWinning for our party and our country in 2016 is do or die,\u201d Priebus said. Earlier in the night, Cruz, Perry and Santorum delivered brief back-to-back speeches designed to fire up the audience about the next election. Cruz, the only declared candidate on stage, shortened his stump speech and added new Hillary Clinton jabs to the mix. The 'Inside Politics' forecast \u201cThe Democratic debate will consist of Hillary and the Chipotle clerk,\u201d he joked. He allowed for the addition of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, saying now the race for the Democratic nomination is a two-person race: \u201cA wild-eyed socialist with dangerous views of foreign policy \u2013 and Bernie Sanders.\u201d For his part, Perry stayed away from Clinton jokes and tried to strike up a bond with the South Carolina audience, reminding them of William Barret Travis and James Bonham, two South Carolinians who fought and died at the Alamo in 1836. \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for South Carolina, there would be no Texas,\u201d Perry said, joking that the state\u2019s governor Nikki Haley, who was sitting in the front row, \u201creminds me of that on a regular basis.\u201d Perry said he feels \u201ca real kinship\u201d with people in South Carolina and praised Graham\u2019s hawkish views on national security. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone in this country that knows foreign policy better than Lindsey Graham. I\u2019ll just tell you that straight up.\u201d Santorum, meanwhile, spent the first part of his remarks saying \u201cSouth Carolina has changed my life\u201d because two of his sons joined The Citadel, a military college in the state, after they traveled there with their father during his 2012 presidential bid. Santorum won the Iowa caucuses and battled Mitt Romney unsuccessfully late into the primary season for the nomination. Gearing up for another bid, he\u2019s made frequent visits to South Carolina and told CNN in an interview before the dinner that the Palmetto State will be an \u201cimportant part\u201d of his potential campaign. Rick Santorum's political career \u201cThis is a home away from home,\u201d Santorum said. Since his last attempt at the White House, the former two-term senator has been stressing a populist message that aims to appeal to blue-collar workers. \u201cWe need a message that says pro-family, pro-manufacturing, pro-energy, pro-the little guy in America,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause that\u2019s who we are as Republicans. We believe in the little guy\u2019s ability to rise, but we don\u2019t do a very good job of talking about it.\u201d The four contenders from Friday night join former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush on Saturday for another round of speeches, this time at the state\u2019s GOP convention, which takes place at the same convention center in Columbia as Friday\u2019s dinner.",

            "article_content": "Republican presidential hopefuls, all of whom oppose gay marriage, have a new litmus test in the cultural wars: would they attend a same-sex wedding? The question highlights the tricky terrain for Republicans and comes as the Supreme Court is set to hear opening arguments on whether gay marriage is a Constitutional right on Tuesday. Polls, meanwhile, continue to show that the majority of Americans support same-sex marriage. READ: What to watch at Supreme Court gay marriage arguments Republicans eyeing the White House must strike a balance between the moderate business wing of their party, which is more in line with the general public, and the Christian conservative wing which flatly opposes same-sex marriage and any attempts to penalize private business owners for refusing to provide services for gay weddings. Broadening the party means hewing closely to the \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d approach that worked on the national level in 2000 and 2004. But Republicans still have to deal with the reality of their party \u2013 according to a CNN/ORC poll, 55% of Republicans don\u2019t think gays and lesbians have a constitutional right to marry and 42% think that they do have that right. The Supreme Court could offer an easy out to the GOP by legalizing same-sex marriage across the country, allowing some White House hopefuls to say they disagree with same-sex marriage as a matter of faith, but also say that the debate is a matter of settled law. \u201cThe Supreme Court gave Republicans a gift by taking up this issue and taking it up this year,\u201d said Gregory T. Angelo, the executive director of Log Cabin Republicans, a group that supports civil marriage equality. \u201cThere will be 17 months of advanced notice that GOP candidates will have to come to the conclusion that I hope they will come to, which is to understand that gay families are here to stay and part of the fabric of this country. For those Republicans who maintain an opposition to gay marriage, it is only going to get more difficult to hold that line \u201c After same-sex marriage became legal in Florida in January, Jeb Bush said in a statement that \u201cwe have to respect the rule of law\u201d and he called for respecting people on both sides of the debate.  His stance could foreshadow the way other more establishment candidates approach the issue once the court rules. READ: Gay hotelier apologizes for hosting Ted Cruz But a sweeping decision in favor of same-sex marriage could also provide new energy for Christian conservatives who want a battle rather than a truce. The fault line between GOP establishment candidates and those heavily courting grassroots religious voters in states like Iowa and South Carolina is likely to sharpen. \u201cIf the Supreme Court acts as many are anticipating, it will not diffuse the issue. It will escalate all the more. It\u2019s more likely religious freedom could become the biggest wedge issue of the 2016 election,\u201d said Steve Deace, a conservative radio talk show host in Iowa. \u201cTalking point answers simply won\u2019t play. Conservatives are looking for action and want to know what your record is on the issue.\u201d But even staking out a position on religious freedom laws has been less than straightforward. In Indiana, Georgia and Arkansas, states with Republican governors, such laws have faced a backlash, as big business came out in strong opposition, and forcing conservative lawmakers to backpedal or table the issue altogether. Nearly 70% of Republicans think that wedding businesses should be allowed to refuse services based on religious grounds. The shifting legal and cultural landscape finds Republican hopefuls staking out a position on complicated terrain. Of the declared candidates, Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz has been the most strident, standing fiercely opposed to same-sex marriage on religious grounds, even as he attended an event hosted by two gay Republicans.  On Saturday, he urged a Christian conservative audience in Iowa to \u201cfall on our knees and pray,\u201d in advance of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision which is expected in June. \u201cThere is a liberal fascism that is dedicated to going after believing Christians who follow the biblical teaching on marriage,\u201d the Texas Republican said.  \u201cWe need leaders who will stand unapologetically in defense of marriage.\u201d Cruz has borrowed from President George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 playbook in introducing a bill that would nullify any court decision and amend the Constitution to allow states to define marriage in the traditional way. The Texas Republican will likely have company from other conservatives, most notably Rick Santorum who opposed civil unions, and same-sex marriage when he ran in 2012 and also backed a constitutional amendment. Santorum recently said he would not attend a same-sex wedding, putting him at odds with Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal who both said they would attend such a wedding.  Rubio also said that gays and lesbians do not have a Constitutional right to marry. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said he attended a reception for a gay wedding, though he argued the matter should be left up the states. READ: Bobby Jindal says he\u2019d \u2018absolutely\u2019 attend same-sex wedding But the state\u2019s rights argument, which Kentucky Sen. Sen. Rand Paul has also espoused, is exactly what\u2019s at issue for the nine justices, and that approach could sound empty if they decide that everyone has a right to wed. Whoever the eventual GOP nominee is will have to decide what to do about the party platform, which states that \u201cthe union of one man and one woman must be upheld as the national standard, a goal to stand for, encourage, and promote through laws governing marriage.\u201d Already, some factions of the party are pushing for the removal of that language, while others expect it to remain. \u201cIf the Supreme Court attempts to impose same-sex marriage on all 50 states in a single, judicial fiat, it will backfire much like Roe v. Wade failed to put an end to the pro-life movement,\u201d said Timothy Head, Executive Director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition. \u201cTo that end, we expect Republican candidates for President and the Republican party platform to remain steadfast in their support of traditional marriage.\u201d What that support actually looks like \u2013 policy proposals or simply rhetoric \u2013 will remain an open question as Republicans head into 2016.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton fights to put furor over a private email server behind her Early signs suggest Clinton is doing what the Clintons do best: mounting a comeback Hillary Clinton is pressing the reset button \u2013 yet again. She\u2019s quietly fighting back a week after her awkward and occasionally combative news conference on the furor over the private email server she used while running the State Department. Clinton\u2019s Twitter account is buzzing this week with posts that test political messages on health care, college affordability, civil rights and jobs \u2013 issues she hopes will help mobilize President Barack Obama\u2019s Democratic coalition and pave her way to the presidency. Meanwhile, her nascent operation is leaking details of future staffers in an unmistakeable message to Democrats spooked by the email flap that the campaign-in-waiting will become an official effort, possibly as soon as next month. READ: Clinton staffs up press, state operations A CNN/ORC International Poll out on Wednesday found that she\u2019s miles ahead of any potential Democratic challenger and would beat all potential Republican candidates by at least 10 points. Despite fretting among some Democrats who worried that the party\u2019s best \u2013 and perhaps only \u2013 viable Democratic candidate appeared to be in trouble, early signs suggest Clinton is doing what the Clintons do best: mounting a comeback. \u201cThe interest in the story is collapsing onto itself. I don\u2019t see an organic clamoring for more information,\u201d said a longtime Clinton ally who didn\u2019t want to speak for a campaign that hasn\u2019t yet been announced. This person, who has spent time in Iowa, argued that outside the community of political reporters and consultants in Washington and New York who fixated on the story, the people who really count \u2013 voters \u2013 weren\u2019t really interested. \u201cPeople very much want to know what the campaign is going to be about \u2026 what is she going to do about student loan costs, for example?\u201d Tharon Johnson, a Democratic strategist who was Southern regional director of Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012, agreed. \u201cIf and when Hillary Clinton decides to run, she will have to address this issue, but I believe the American people are more interested in her addressing the kitchen table issues that matter most to them,\u201d he said. Of course, Clinton still faces plenty of challenges and the email saga raised questions about whether she can run a more sophisticated, no drama campaign than the one she managed in 2008. But the CNN poll revealed that those critical of Clinton\u2019s role in the email affair appear to break close to party lines and her favorable rating remains at 53%. A slow recent decline in that rating appears to coincide with Clinton\u2019s slow re-entry into partisan politics and does not necessarily reflect her recent stumbles. Perhaps the most intriguing figure in the poll is that only 1% of respondents had never heard of Clinton. That supports the idea expressed by some Democrats that Clinton may be the most vetted figure in public life. There are people who will never vote for her and those who are dedicated to her quest to be the first female president, but very few whose minds may not be made up. A less well-known candidate might have made a terrible first impression if faced with the kind of hyper-covered flap Clinton was. READ: Top Republican grants Hillary Clinton subpoena extension But Republicans believe the email scandal could be a political gift that keeps on giving, as it touches on a narrative that the Clintons are secretive, resistant to transparency and often blur the rules. Poll: Clinton leads potential Democrat rivals by 47 pts There are also other problems \u2013 including the question of foreign funds sent to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton\u2019s whopper speaking fees \u2013 that Republicans believe could reach a political mass and fan doubts about the likely Democratic nominee\u2019s character. Then there are the foreign policy questions, including a now damaging photo op in which Clinton offered a \u201creset\u201d button to Russia only for the country to revert to a Cold War-esque posture. She was also a central player in Obama\u2019s foreign policy, which often appears to be overtaken by the Middle East\u2019s swift descent into chaos. \u201cFor everything that I can see, the Democrats have put all of their eggs in one basket here,\u201d said Sean Spicer, communications director of the Republican National Committee. \u201cThat is more of a downfall in the general election than in the primary.\u201d Spicer argued that even with younger voters, who do not remember the Clinton years, the question of impropriety over her emails could provide an entry point into past scandals. Though Clinton is the prohibitive Democratic front-runner, her support in the party is not universal. But where she faces resistance, it is more likely to be over policy than emails, as grass-roots Democrats are suspicious over her centrist, pro-business and hawkish foreign policy leanings. \u201cAs this discussion was playing out inside the Beltway, our members were focused on issues,\u201d said Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org, which wants Elizabeth Warren to challenge Clinton for the Democratic nomination. READ: Does Jeb Bush have a Hillary Clinton problem? Galland said activists were preoccupied with the preservation of the social safety net, constraining Wall Street and those on the \u201cragged edge\u201d of the middle class. Similarly, the young voters who flocked to Obama in 2008 and who will be crucial to Clinton\u2019s hopes of mobilizing an effective Democratic coalition in 2016 may also offer Clinton a political cushion. This group is hazy over historic references to long ago Clinton scandals like Filegate, Travelgate and even the Monica Lewinsky episode that led to President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThe media loves a Clinton scandal,\u201d said one Democratic source who didn\u2019t want to be named because he doesn\u2019t work for Clinton. \u201cBut young people are more likely to know her as secretary of state, and someone who ran for president in 2008.\u201d Polling bears out the theory. The CNN survey shows Clinton\u2019s favorability among voters age 18 to 34 with a 22 point positive differential. But she\u2019s barely in positive territory among voters age 50 to 64, who are likely to have strong memories of her time as first lady, and is  underwater among those 60 or older. Another well-connected Democrat who didn\u2019t want to go on the record criticizing Clinton admitted that the email issue did play into GOP caricatures about the allegedly \u201cconspiratorial\u201d politicians and that it could challenge the former secretary of state\u2019s early efforts to get her message out about her ideas and rationale for running for president. But Democratic operatives think that once Clinton is actually running, with an infrastructure behind her, and striking messages about the minimum wage, college debt and middle-class economic issues, voters will engage. In many ways, the email furor was a story the media couldn\u2019t wait to write, so it may be that journalists have inflated the importance of the episode, at least in the absence of any evidence that Clinton broke the law or made classified information vulnerable. Political reporters have pined for weeks for Clinton to swing her campaign into action, and her failure to offer a storyline opened a vacuum that was easy for unflattering stories to fill. Her slow response breathed new life into a question that only Clinton can answer: Will her 2016 campaign be as dysfunctional, reactive and distracted as her chaotic and unsuccessful 2008 effort? But there were a few lessons. It\u2019s clear the Clinton machine is not about to morph into a humming, scandal-free effort in the image of Barack Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign. And Clinton\u2019s bitter relationship with political reporters seems as bad as ever. The days when she partied with a State Department press corps more preoccupied with policy than politics seem like ancient history. But here also, Clinton is trying a reset. Her nascent campaign has made it known that she is staffing up her campaign and press operation. John Podesta, who is expected to take a leadership role in her campaign, is respected by reporters, as is Jennifer Palmieri, the outgoing White House communications director expected to take on a similar role for Clinton. On Tuesday, it emerged that Clinton would name Brian Fallon, who has also good ties with reporters, to be lead press secretary.",

            "article_content": "Republicans praise tough Egyptian line on radical Islam Potential 2016 GOP candidates use Sisi comments as cudgel against Obama Comments mark latest twist in diplomatic dance between Washington and Cairo He ousted Egypt\u2019s first democratically elected president in a coup, crushed political dissent, let foreign journalists languish in jail and just jabbed the U.S. by greeting Vladimir Putin as a hero. Yet Egypt\u2019s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is fast becoming the favorite Middle East strongman of American conservatives and Republican presidential hopefuls. Jeb Bush says he can\u2019t understand why the White House has told Sisi \u201cyou\u2019re not on our team\u201d as jihadism spreads like wildfire through the Middle East. Ted Cruz, another GOP 2016 pretender has also praised him, and key conservative media figures are lionizing Sisi. The rush of affection for the former Army Chief contrasts with the strained relationship between Sisi and the White House, reflected in the Obama administration\u2019s decision not to publicly back air strikes by Egypt on a common enemy \u2013 ISIS \u2013 in Libya this week. It\u2019s also the latest manifestation of the decades-long tussle between the U.S. and Egypt, which pits a push for human rights and democracy against the yearning for a stable pro-U.S. partner in a chaotic region, whatever the character of its regime. The spur for the conservative infatuation for Sisi was a speech in January in which the Egyptian leader warned Islam was being \u201ctorn\u201d and \u201cdestroyed\u201d by extremism. \u201cIt\u2019s inconceivable that the thinking that we hold most sacred should cause the entire Islamic world to be a source of anxiety, danger, killing and destruction for the rest of the world,\u201d said Sisi. Sisi spoke in a highly symbolic venue, the Al Azhar Mosque in Cairo, one of the most vaulted seats of learning in the Muslim world. \u201cIt\u2019s antagonizing the entire world! Does this mean that 1.6 billion people (Muslims) should want to kill the rest of the world\u2019s inhabitants \u2013 that is 7 billion \u2013 so that they themselves may live? Impossible!\u200b\u201d On the face of it, Sisi\u2019s speech was a call to cleanse Islam of extremist thought and elements which groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda have used to justify jihad. It continues to impress conservatives in the United States amid a fierce political debate about how to contain ISIS\u2019s march across the region. \u201cHe gave this incredible speech about Muslim extremism, and saying it\u2019s the responsibility of the Arab world to step up to fight this; that the first risks are for countries like Egypt,\u201d Bush said in Chicago on Wednesday. It\u2019s no coincidence that Republicans are praising the speech\u2019s blunt message at the same time as they are accusing President Barack Obama of falling prey to political correctness in his unwillingness to state the U.S. is at war with radical Islam. That comparison is also frequently being made on conservative talk radio. Cruz also praised Sisi on Fox News on Wednesday. \u201cWhat would be far better to see was the kind of courage that was demonstrated just a few weeks ago by President al-Sisi in Cairo,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we see the president of the United States demonstrating that same courage, just to speak the truth, about the face of evil we are facing right now?\u201d Cruz asked. Mike Huckabee, another potential Republican presidential contender, said \u201cthank God for President al-Sisi in Egypt\u201d in an interview with NewsMax TV. Southern Baptist leader Richard Land wrote in The Christian Post that the Sisi speech could be as historically resonant as Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cI have a Dream\u201d speech or president John Kennedy\u2019s declaration : \u201cIch bin ein Berliner.\u201d Conservative commentator George Will said on Fox News Sunday last month that Sisi may deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. But are U.S. political figures ripping a speech redolent with Egyptian political overtones out of context to back up their own positions? Professor Nathan Brown of George Washington University said that Sisi\u2019s remarks were not that unusual and that a number of Arab leaders have previously given similar speeches to limited effect. \u201cIt is standard stuff,\u201d he said. And Sisi\u2019s record toward political opponents and extremists, especially the Muslim Brotherhood, which formed Egypt\u2019s first democratic government until it was ousted by his army amid mass protests in 2013, paints a different picture of the Egyptian leader. \u201cThe way that Sisi represents dealing with them is not through abstract theological arguments but through a severe security and political response,\u201d said Brown, who is also with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThat is what he represents. That part of the message gets lost.\u201d The State Department and rights groups fault Egypt for the removal of a civilian government, using lethal force to disburse MB protests, and for killing hundreds of protestors nationwide and say discrimination against Christians and Jews in Egypt remains widespread. The ISIS terror threat Some analysts interpreted Sisi\u2019s speech as a way to justify the exclusion from politics of Islamist elements from political life in Egypt following his landslide win in an election last year in which the Brotherhood was banned. Since the election, the Obama administration has tried to carefully restore ties with Egypt on the grounds that it remains a vital strategic partner. Secretary of State John Kerry visited Cairo in September and Obama met Sisi on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York last year. Close intelligence cooperation continues behind the scenes. But relations have remained strained. After the coup the U.S. temporarily held up a tranch of $500 million in military aid to Egypt and an order of attack helicopters. Reconciliation has been made more difficult by the detention in Egypt of foreign journalists. The spectacle of Putin getting a warm welcome from Sisi in a visit last week did not go unnoticed in Washington, and was an apparent sign from the Cairo government that if the U.S. does not take better care of its friends, Egypt  will look elsewhere. The Pentagon, meanwhile, said it was not even told in advance about Egyptian air strikes this week on ISIS targets in Libya in revenge for the beheadings of 21 Egyptian Coptic Christian workers by an ISIS-affiliated group. \u201cIt\u2019s a complex relationship that we have with Egypt,\u201d said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby. ISIS\u2019s swift spread in the Arab world has some realists in Washington considering whether it\u2019s time to re-emphasise the stability dimension of the U.S. relationship with Cairo. Bush suggested as much on Wednesday, in remarks that were especially noteworthy because the second term administration of his brother, George W. Bush, angered the government of then Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak by issuing a call for democracy in the Arab world as part of its Freedom Agenda. Jeb Bush asked Wednesday: \u201cIs (Sisi) a little \u201cL\u201d liberal democrat that believes in freedom like we do?\u201d \u201cNo, he isn\u2019t. But I think we have to be practical,\u201d Bush said in the first foreign policy speech of his putative presidential campaign which could augur another turn in the roller coaster US-Egypt relationship. \u201cWe have to balance our belief in liberty with a belief that security and engagement will create the possibilities for the Egyptians to garner more freedom. \u201c",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney focused on how to address poverty, minority outreach as he considers another presidential bid He stressed that the government should encourage people to get married as a way to combat poverty As renewed attention surfaces on his wealth, Romney's team points to another wealthy potential candidate, Hillary Clinton Mitt Romney argued on Wednesday that Republicans need to spend more time targeting nontraditional GOP voters during presidential primaries, saying the party\u2019s messaging gap is greatest with minority voters. \u201cDuring our campaigns for the primary vote, we tend to go to the audiences that vote in a Republican primary and tend therefore not to be as involved in minority communities as we need to be to win the general election,\u201d the 2012 Republican presidential nominee told an audience at Mississippi State University. \u201cAnd so we got to stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election,\u201d he continued. He followed up saying he wasn\u2019t urging Republicans to spend less time thinking about the primary but to devote equal amount of attention to \u201call audiences.\u201d Romney, who\u2019s considering yet another presidential bid, made no mention of where he is in his thought process about a third campaign, but said he felt confident that \u201cthe great days of America have not ended; they\u2019re ahead with the right kind of leadership.\u201d Combating poverty In his speech, Romney hit on familiar refrains about nostalgia from his campaign as well as challenges facing the country. He also wove in swipes against Clinton, who\u2019s widely considered the Democratic frontrunner if she runs for president. If Romney runs again, he\u2019s likely to make anti-poverty policy a key part of his message. Romney said the war on poverty that started under President Lyndon B. Johnson \u201ccame from a good heart\u201d but argued \u201cthe policies weren\u2019t as good as the heart.\u201d To address the problem, Romney argued that the government should not create incentives for people to avoid marriage, saying a single mother on Medicaid or other assistance may not want to get married because she could lose her benefits. \u201cIf marriage \u2026 is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty, then we want to do the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to create incentives for them to get married, not to not get married.\u201d He also said K-12 education needs to improve, and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who haven\u2019t worked before, but didn\u2019t outline specifics. Blasting Clinton Romney is also looking straight past his potential GOP rivals and sharpening his attacks against Hillary Clinton. He argued that the former secretary of state was \u201cclueless\u201d on relations with Russia and would prove inept on economic policy if elected president. \u201cHow can Secretary Clinton provide opportunity for all if she doesn\u2019t know where jobs come from in the first place?\u201d Romney said. He also argued that Clinton helped contribute to Obama\u2019s \u201ctimid\u201d approach to foreign policy. \u201cSecretary of State Hillary Clinton cluelessly pressed a reset button for Russia, which smiled and then invaded Ukraine, a sovereign nation,\u201d Romney said. RELATED: Hillary Clinton stands by \u2018Russian reset\u2019 in face of recent events As Romney was headed to Mississippi, the nation\u2019s poorest state, his political team fought back against perceptions that his wealth could be a political liability if he runs for president again, arguing that Clinton is no model for modest living, either. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard for Hillary Clinton to make Mitt Romney\u2019s wealth a fruitful line of attack, with her multi-million dollar mansions in Georgetown and Chappaqua and her jet-setting lifestyle of the rich and famous,\u201d a Romney aide said Wednesday. That comment was also included in a new report by the Boston Globe that details how Romney purchased or built two new homes after his 2012 election loss. The former private equity CEO, whose wealth became an overriding theme for Democratic attacks, has a total of four homes: a mansion in La Jolla, California; a ski chalet in Park City, Utah; a large home in Salt Lake City; and a house on Lake Winnipesaukee, New Hampshire. The home in La Jolla, complete with a car elevator, has been undergoing renovations to make it bigger since 2012, and according the Globe, is now being shown to potential buys by a broker. Correct the Record, the pro-Clinton communications and research PAC, pushed back against Romney\u2019s response Wednesday. \u201cWhile Mitt Romney tries in vain to reinvent himself as a friend to those who are struggling, Hillary Clinton is continuing her life-long work to lift up the middle class and level the playing field for all Americans,\u201d said Adrienne Elrod, communications director for the group, said in an email to CNN. RELATED: Jeb Bush\u2019s invisible man strategy Romney was constantly playing defense against multi-million dollar Democratic campaigns that pilloried his corporate background and painted him as out of touch. He also sought to overcome a string of gaffes\u2015i.e. \u201cI like being able to fire people\u201d and \u201cI have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners\u201c\u2015that Democrats quickly used as fuel for their fire against the then-GOP nominee. A spokesman for Clinton did not immediately return a request for comment. The former secretary of state, widely seen as the Democratic frontrunner if she runs for president, has fought her own battle against accusations of being out of touch, in part because of her six-figure speaking fees and because of comments she made last summer in which she argued that her family was \u201cdead broke\u201d after leaving the White House. Romney\u2019s $50,000 honorarium (minus travel costs) is being donated to Charity Vision, a restorative eyesight organization based in Provo, Utah. Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Boxer announced her decision not to run for reelection in 2016 in a YouTube video with her grandson \"I am never going to retire,\" Boxer said. \"The work is too important.\" Boxer said she will work to elect the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016 and \"make history.\" She supports Hillary Clinton House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was caught off guard by the news at a press conference and became emotional Sen. Barbara Boxer announced Thursday that she will not run for reelection in 2016, setting up a big money political battle for her seat in the nation\u2019s most populous state. Boxer, the 74-year-old Democratic junior Senator from California, said that she is not retiring from public life and will continue working on \u201cthe issues that I love\u201d through her political action committee, PAC for a Change. Boxer was first elected to the Senate in 1992. \u201cI am never going to retire,\u201d Boxer said. \u201cThe work is too important.\u201d Boxer\u2019s decision sets off one of the most competitive races for a statewide seat in California\u2019s recent history, and the field to replace her began to shape up within hours. The state\u2019s deep bench of Democratic rising stars sets up the prospect of a fierce intra-party fight for the seat. Multiple Democrats on Capitol Hill have already expressed interest, with a source close to Rep. Loretta Sanchez telling CNN she\u2019s keeping the door open to a run but has no time frame for a decision. Rep. John Garamendi also said he would consider it in a statement, and called Boxer an \u201coutstanding senator and public servant.\u201d \u201cI have been asked by several people to consider the U.S. Senate because of my years of service in the U.S. Congress and having been elected statewide as Lieutenant Governor and Insurance Commissioner, along with executive experience in the Interior Department. I will consider it, but my first duty is to the people of the 3rd Congressional District,\u201d he said. Others, still, have already taken themselves out of the running. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer isn\u2019t interested, a spokesman said, and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, who is considered a strong contender for statewide office in the future, ruled himself out of the race in a statement Thursday. \u201cThe first thing we should do today is thank Senator Barbara Boxer for being a powerful champion for our city, state and nation in the United States Senate,\u201d Garcetti said in a statement. \u201cI love my job and I love my city and I am committed to the work here. I will not run for Sen. Boxer\u2019s seat.\u201d California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon also isn\u2019t interested, his spokesman said. All eyes have turned to Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who all have deep fundraising bases in California and are seen as top contenders for the seat. None have commented on their interest in the race, though both Harris and Newsom issued releases commending Boxer for her decades of service. Both Harris and Newsom have expressed strong interest to their confidantes in running for the U.S. Senate seat, but both are also intrigued by the possibility of running for Governor when Jerry Brown leaves office \u2014 setting up the possibility that they could work out a deal, particularly since they share the same political consultant, California-based strategist Ace Smith. In what was viewed as a tea leaf indicating that possibility, Harris took the surprise role of administering the oath to Newsom on Jan. 5 when he was sworn in for his second term as Lieutenant Governor. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein told reporters in the Capitol on Thursday she thinks there\u2019s \u201ca high likelihood\u201d that Newsom and Villaraigosa will run, and that she\u2019s heard of a few House members interested in the race as well. But she said California\u2019s jungle primary system \u2014 which pits all candidates, regardless of party, against each other in a first round of voting, with the top two vote-getters proceeding to a faceoff in November \u2014 makes it difficult to peg a frontrunner at this point. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to predict how people do in that kind of race,\u201d she said. Feinstein also noted that because of the size of the state, it\u2019s important for candidates to coalesce support quickly. \u201cMost candidates don\u2019t realize until they\u2019ve run how big the state is and how you have to reach people,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really comes down to media, unfortunately.\u00a0 And that\u2019s the part of it.\u00a0 It\u2019s costly.\u201d READ: Sen. Dianne Feinstein\u2019s big moment Any of those potential candidates could face a formidable challenge from Billionaire Tom Steyer, who spent $74 million \u2014 much of it his own money \u2014 trying to sway the midterm elections by engaging voters on climate change without much in the way of results. Other possible contenders include Treasurer John Chiang, Secretary of State Alex Padilla and Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones. \u201cEvery house member looks in the mirror and sees a United States Senator,\u201d said Dan Schnur, executive director of the Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California. \u201cSo there are probably 52 members of Congress in California thinking about running for Boxer\u2019s seat this morning.\u201d While California remains a deep-blue state, and the GOP bench of candidates there is thin, Republicans have floated the prospect of a wide field of Democratic contenders splitting the party\u2019s vote and allowing for a Republican to squeak through the primary to the general. But one of their top prospects, Rep. Darrell Issa, isn\u2019t interested in the race, according to a source close to the congressman. He declined to comment on his plans for the race to reporters earlier, but knocked Boxer, commenting that \u201cthe fact that she\u2019s not running doesn\u2019t change the fact it\u2019s always been a vacant office.\u201d Neither Rep. Ed Royce nor businesswoman Carly Fiorina will run, according to statements from their staff on Thursday. A GOP coup there remains a long shot, and on Thursday Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Chairman Jon Tester thanked Boxer for giving Democrats enough time to line up a credible candidate. \u201cI appreciate that Senator Boxer has made an early decision, giving us more than enough time to get behind a strong Democratic candidate who will hold this seat,\u201d he said, adding they\u2019re \u201cconfident\u201d they\u2019ll reelect a Democrat to the seat. Boxer explained her decision to not seek re-election in a mock interview with her oldest grandson in a video posted to YouTube. The liberal senator added that she plans to help Democrats\u2019 2016 candidate for president \u201cmake history.\u201d Boxer has said repeatedly that former Secretary of State Hillary Cllinton should run for president and has fundraised for the Ready For Hillary PAC. She also said she is committed to ensuring her Senate seat stays in the hands of progressive Democrats and is, ultimately, anxious to return to California. The unapologetic liberal was one of her party\u2019s most outspoken advocates on environmental issues and routinely sparred with Republicans as head of the Senate Environment and Public Works committee. But she was also known for forging bipartisan relationships and compromises, and earned the respect of some of the GOP\u2019s most conservative members for her work on transportation and infrastructure issues. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California became emotional during a press conference on Thursday when a reporter asked her about Boxer\u2019s announcement. Pelosi was caught off guard by the question and hadn\u2019t yet found out. \u201cIt\u2019s funny \u2013 she called me, she said she wanted to talk to me personally. I thought she wanted to maybe to have dinner tonight,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cHer leaving will be a great loss to the Congress of the United States, people of California, and to our country.\u201d Pelosi on Sen. Boxer's Retirement: \"What?\" Pelosi called Boxer, who is just under 5 feet tall \u201csmall in size, but a giant in terms of her contribution.\u201d Pelosi on Boxer retirement: \u2018What?\u2019 Boxer emphasized that her age was not a factor in her decision, nor was the hyper-partisan environment that has dominated Washington in recent years. \u201cWhen you stand up there and you fight to make sure there\u2019s a strong middle class and you protect a woman\u2019s right to choose and you fight for jobs and a clean environment\u2026all those things are a fight worth making,\u201d Boxer said in the video. She added that her age was \u201cdefinitely not\u201d a factor. \u201cSome people are old at 40, some people are young at 80. I feel as young as I did when I got elected. I was in my 50s,\u201d Boxer said. California\u2019s senior Sen. Dianne Feinstein, also a Democrat, is the oldest current serving member of the Senate. She has not announced her decision on running for reelection in 2018. Boxer, who apparently has a fondness for rhymes, closed the \u201cinterview\u201d with a few rhymes. \u201cThe Senate is the place where I\u2019ve always made my case. For families, for the planet and the human race. More than 20 years in a job I love, thanks to California and the Lord above. So although I wont be working from my senate space and I wont\u2019 be running in that next tough race. As long as there are issues and challenges and strife, I will never retire because that\u2019s the meaning of my life.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: J. Michael Cole is a Taipei-based senior non-resident fellow with the University of Nottingham\u2019s China Policy Institute, an associate researcher with the French Centre for Research on Contemporary China (CEFC), and editor-in-chief of thinking-taiwan.com \u2014 which is affiliated with the Thinking Taiwan Foundation founded by Taiwan presidential candidate Tsai Ing-wen. The opinions expressed here are solely his. Meeting isn't likely to be a game changer for Taiwan and China relations Beijing might be trying to influence election in Taiwan's rowdy democracy The oft-neglected island-nation of Taiwan was at the center of international news this week after it was announced that its President, Ma Ying-jeou, and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, will hold a summit in Singapore on Saturday. Described as \u201chistoric,\u201d the meeting\u2014the first between the leaders of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait since 1949, when Mao Zedong\u2019s Communists defeated Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s Nationalist forces in a brutal civil war, forcing Chiang and more than a million Nationalists to flee to Taiwan\u2014promises additional drama ahead of Taiwan\u2019s upcoming presidential elections and could have repercussions on future relations between Taiwan and China. Under the auspices of the Singaporean government, Mr. Xi and Mr. Ma\u2014who will address each other as such\u2014will meet in what officials in Taipei and Beijing have optimistically described as a sign of continued stability in the Taiwan Strait following seven years of rapprochement. READ: Taiwan and China: Friends, foes or frenemies? No sooner had news of the upcoming summit been confirmed than analysts worldwide began trying to determine the significance of the landmark meeting: Would it fundamentally alter the face of cross-strait relations? Would it have an impact on the January 16 presidential and legislative elections, in which Ma\u2019s Kuomintang (KMT) party is expected to do poorly? Or was it a purely a symbolic exercise, perhaps an eleventh-hour desperate act by Beijing to influence the domestic politics of the rowdy democracy it claims as its own and help its embattled ally in Taipei? Geopolitically speaking, the meeting could be part of Beijing\u2019s recent efforts to assuage fears within the region, caused in part by mounting tensions in the South China Sea due to Beijing\u2019s territorial claims, and to demonstrate its willingness to talk with its regional partners\u2014Taiwan included. Still, given the sensitive timing, it is difficult not to see a link between the upcoming summit and the January elections. After all, Chinese and Taiwan authorities have had seven years of rapprochement to make this happen, and Xi will be sitting down with a leader who, come May 20 next year, will be out of office. So why now, is the question on everyone\u2019s mind at the moment. If, as Beijing has indicated, the purpose of the summit is to institutionalize cross-strait meetings and improve relations between the two sides, then it would be far more logical for Xi to seek a meeting with Ma\u2019s likely successor, Tsai Ing-wen of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who has been well ahead in the polls largely due to her active focus on domestic matters and general disenchantment with the KMT. The fact of the matter is, the unpopular KMT is in dire straits. It has been struggling to regain its footing in the election after two very difficult years marked by major protests over a services trade pact with China and a disastrous showing in local elections held late last year, in which it lost control of most municipalities across Taiwan. Its current travails were highlighted on October 17 when the party replaced its highly unpopular presidential candidate, Hung Hsiu-chu, who had campaigned on a platform seeking even closer ties with Beijing, with the more palatable party chairman, Eric Chu, a move that so far has only had a marginal impact on the KMT\u2019s prospects in the elections. It is therefore likely that Beijing calculated it needed to do something high-profile enough to help the KMT, its favorite partner in Taipei. And the one area in which it could provide such assistance to the KMT was on the China \u201cissue,\u201d over which it is perceived to have an advantage over the more \u201cpro-independence\u201d DPP. Nothing could help reinforce the commonly held notion abroad that the KMT is better positioned to ensure peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait\u2014and conversely that the DPP would undermine such efforts\u2014than for the two heads of state to be seen together. Ma was keen to play up the international angle to his upcoming meeting during a press conference on Thursday morning, which the entire foreign diplomatic community in Taipei was invited to attend. And by sheer coincidence, the Ma-Xi meeting will take place three days before  Chu, the KMT\u2019s presidential candidate, embarks on a U.S. trip, during which discussions on his China policy are expected to take place. Yet such intervention in Taiwan\u2019s affairs is probably too little, too late, and will not give the KMT enough momentum to dislodge Tsai. It is also a gamble that could backfire, especially if the summit is perceived as a plot by Beijing and the KMT to molest Taiwan\u2019s democratic processes. It doesn\u2019t help either that by meeting Xi, Ma will be breaking an earlier promise, made during his re-election campaign in 2011, that he would not meet with a Chinese president while in office unless he had the public approval to do so. Such public approval doesn\u2019t seem to exist at the moment. Although a majority of Taiwan residents favor dialogue with China and are amenable to the liberalization of ties with the next-door powerhouse, they recoil at the idea that such efforts may be exploited for partisan politics and electoral purposes. READ: Behind threats and supercharged rhetoric: Trade Thus, while highly symbolic and \u201chistoric\u201d for the fact that the leaders on both sides of the Taiwan Strait will be meeting for the first time in 66 years, Saturday\u2019s summit won\u2019t be a game changer\u2014unless it is mishandled badly and causes an uproar back in Taiwan. But that is unlikely. Already, Taipei and Beijing have stated that no agreement will be reached during the meeting, and that no joint press conference will be held. This is probably wise, as anything beyond symbolism, any commitment that forces the future leader of Taiwan to deal with a fait accompli, would spark a backlash in Taiwan and threaten to further erode the KMT\u2019s appeal. It that is indeed the strategy behind the meeting, it is an ill-advised one that will cause serious complications down the road. By now, Beijing probably understands (or certainly should understand) Taiwan\u2019s democracy well enough to know that rash moves will be counterproductive, as it discovered in 1996 when it bracketed the island-nation with missiles before the first direct presidential election there. One consequence of the rapprochement that occurred during Ma\u2019s time in office is that the Taiwanese have become much more sensitive to any move by Beijing or the KMT that threatens to undermine the liberal democratic way of life they cherish. Such alertness, which manifested itself last year during the Sunflower Movement, has also become sharper due to recent political developments in Hong Kong, the Special Administrative Region of China. that serve as a warning to Taiwan of what could happen if they allow Beijing to take control of their destiny, or if one of their leaders hands over the keys to the Chinese leadership. Unless it is ready to undo seven years of d\u00e9tente, which for the most part has been beneficial to Beijing, and alienate Taiwan, Beijing will have to act with restraint. Therefore, those who look for a game changer on Saturday stand to be disappointed. The opinions expressed here and solely those of the author",

            "article_content": "Outside groups are using Virginia's legislative elections Tuesday as a testing ground for messaging and voter contact methods ahead of 2016 Michael Bloomberg's pro-gun control super PAC has invested $2.2 million total in northern Virginia and outside Richmond \"They would like these folks to win, but on the other hand, they want to test some messages out to see what works\" Cody Holt knocked just left of the \u201cBoo\u201d sticker on the front door, waiting a few beats in front of a Minnie Mouse puppet stuffed in a pumpkin and shrubbery dressed in fake cobwebs. When the voter didn\u2019t emerge the evening after Halloween, Holt withdrew his Americans for Prosperity \u201cEconomic Freedom in Action\u201d placard from the stack and draped it over the door handle. \u201cI\u2019ve always wondered, if I knock on the door and someone isn\u2019t there,\u201d Holt said, as he ambled to the next house, \u201chow likely are they to read it?\u201d After Tuesday\u2019s pivotal legislative elections in Virginia, he might no longer have to just wonder. Outside groups are pouring into these suburban neighborhoods as they try and tip the balance in the Virginia state senate, a body that can flip to Democratic control with just one seat turning from red to blue. The leading agitator: New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg, whose pro-gun control super PAC has invested $2.2 million total in northern Virginia and in one other district near Richmond \u2013 an unprecedented sum for an election like this with no president, governor, U.S. senator or U.S. representative on the ballot. But the bigger prize is the White House. This \u201coff-off-year\u201d election in what has become a reliable purple state offers outside groups a playground to try out tools and arguments they hope can change the game in 2016. Are voters more likely to be at their door if they receive advance notice that canvassers are in the area? Are non-English speakers more likely to vote if sent mail in their native tongue? And what\u2019s the harm of not doing any grassroots engagement at all \u2014 and just winging it? \u201cThey would like these folks to win, but on the other hand, they want to test some messages out to see what works,\u201d said Bob Holsworth, a longtime observer of Virginia politics. \u201cIt\u2019s very much what you would see at a private sector company.\u201d The answers could determine what kind of message Hillary Clinton emphasizes, or how much time and effort a Republican candidate spends trying to win votes in the more liberal Washington suburbs. Academics have long pined for candidates to apply the scientific method to their races, but few candidates are eager to sacrifice a possible win in order to prove intellectual points about modern campaigning. What has changed the game is the presence of outside advocacy groups with the funding and patience to think 10 years down the road \u2013 and aren\u2019t tied to any particular candidate or party. These groups don\u2019t need to explain to a ballroom of supporters why they lost \u2014 they can experiment, take whatever lessons they learn, good or bad, and get back to work next time. So at some homes in four different regions across the state, organizers like Holt won\u2019t leave any door hangers \u2014 one of four \u201ctest cells\u201d the group has employed through Tuesday. Then during the weeks after Election Day, AFP brass will check their data set and judge whether the treatment effect was large enough to be worth producing, printing and placing the hangers in the first place, as it promotes an agenda of expanding school choice, rolling back EPA regulations and fighting the expansion of Medicaid. In the parlance of AFP, the conservative grassroots organization at the heart of the Koch brothers\u2019 powerful network, it\u2019s running to, \u201ctest and learn.\u201d \u201cThat took some getting used to, because my entire political career was holding a door hanger in one hand,\u201d Holt said. When testing, he has to guard his volunteers from violating the experiment\u2019s integrity: \u201cDo you have door hangers in your car? Do you have door hangers in your mind?\u201d he joked that he may ask his group. \u201cI want them all.\u201d These tests are unfolding in an unusual campaign season that those in Virginia politics describe as suddenly dominated not by groups like AFP, but by one man: Bloomberg, whose gun safety super PAC, Everytown for Gun Safety, has flooded Virginia with advertisements that conservatives have not been able to match. Virginia is still reeling from the killings of two journalists on live television earlier this summer \u2014 and Everytown is trying to tap into that emotion. \u201cMy daughter Alison and her cameraman were gunned down on live television. I know we can\u2019t stop all gun violence, but we can save lives if our leaders take action,\u201d Andy Parker, father of slain journalist Alison Parker, says in the ads, which then progress to attack the Republicans\u2019 gun records and backing from the NRA. Groups like Everytown are, in a sense, running one big experiment of their own \u2014 whether they can win. But Democrats nationally have been reluctant to run on gun platforms in presidential years, especially in swing-states like Ohio or here in Virginia, where gun ownership is high and the NRA is headquartered. But that challenge is animating \u2014 even daring \u2014 to gun-control groups that are endeavoring to show Democrats like Clinton or her ally, Gov. Terry McAuliffe, that a pro-gun control message could be a political winner next year. \u201cYou can run in the NRA\u2019s own backyard, and you\u2019re going to have support,\u201d said Colin Goddard, a survivor of the 2007 shooting at Virginia Tech who now works for Everytown. In turn, Republicans like Hal Parrish, the Manassas mayor and state senate candidate in district 29, are looking to turn the tables on the New York-based group by casting them as outsiders in their own spots. The other leading gun-control super PAC, former congresswoman Gabby Giffords\u2019 Americans for Responsible Solutions, is less interested than Everytown in proving a point in the South than it is in testing bolder moves to come. In a series of small targeted digital buys across the state, the group is hoping to prove whether flashy video ads or static images work better for turning out voters with high \u201cgun violence prevention scores.\u201d Meanwhile, women\u2019s organizations like Emily\u2019s List are trying to fine-tune their demographic targeting to see which women can be mobilized on their issue. Another liberal group, New Virginia Majority, has two main experiments embedded into its get-out-the-vote program: some new English speakers have been sent mail in their first language, while others are being asked to read it in their second. And at the door, the civic engagement group is trying something fairly unusual in the modern are \u2014 meaningful, time-consuming conversations with voters unsure who they will vote for if they will at all, rather than the quick-touch, waste-no-time mantra of field programs of the high-tech era. \u201cThe beauty of Virginia is that we have elections every year,\u201d explained Tram Nguyen, the group\u2019s head. That\u2019s the thinking of groups that plan to live another day even if McAuliffe is unable to flip the chamber, a task that he has devoted tremendous political muscle toward accomplishing. Gun-control groups think that he might be able to push through firearm legislation if the Senate turns Democratic; Republicans have trained their eyes on delivering the boastful former Democratic National Committee chair a stinging defeat a year before McAuliffe is expected to try and engineer a Clinton victory in November 2016. That\u2019s the race that is being foreshadowed Tuesday \u2014 even if Clinton or the Republicans aren\u2019t yet on the ballot. And for data-driven groups like AFP, it\u2019s a chance to learn exactly how to win it. \u201cThis is about as scientific as you can get,\u201d Holt said, \u201cwhen dealing with people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "U.S. policy under Obama toward Israel and Iran has soured many Florida Jewish voters on Hillary Clinton Republicans have seized on Obama's rocky relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Like most Jewish voters in Florida, Arthur Barr voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary. When she lost the nomination, he supported then-Sen. Barack Obama \u2013 ardently. \u201cI voted for Obama, I made donations, I had phone banks, I set up at condominiums and (sent) thousands of emails,\u201d said Barr, a 74-year-old south Florida resident. \u201cBy the third year, I realized I made a humongous mistake.\u201d The next election, he voted for Republican nominee Mitt Romney as a rejection of Obama\u2019s policies toward Israel. And as the 2016 election nears, Barr has no plans to vote for Clinton, the Democratic front-runner. Republicans have seized on Obama\u2019s rocky relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has publicly clashed with the President over Iran and the Palestinians, to argue that Obama has not been a strong ally of the Jewish state. And they\u2019re extending that criticism to Clinton, who carried out Obama\u2019s policies for four years in her role as his secretary of state. READ: In backing Iran deal, Clinton stresses commitment to Israel Though Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat, conversations with Jewish voters at Ben\u2019s Kosher Delicatessen in Boca Raton suggested the GOP strategy is more than just wishful thinking. Patrons expressed deep dissatisfaction with Obama\u2019s dealings with Israel, and those feelings have tainted their impression of the former New York senator, who won Florida\u2019s Jewish voters 2-to-1 over Obama in the 2008 primary. Hal Silverman, a 78-year-old Brooklyn transplant who\u2019s lived in Boca Raton for the last 25 years, was one of those Democrats who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. In the latter contest, the President won the county \u2013 Palm Beach \u2013 by 17 points, thanks in part to the Jewish vote; the county has the fourth-highest number of Jews in the country. \u201cI\u2019ve always voted straight Democratic Party unless I particularly knew one or two of the people running who weren\u2019t Democrats who were better for the community,\u201d he explained on a sunny Friday outside Ben\u2019s, where CNN spoke with a dozen Jewish voters about Clinton and the 2016 election. But U.S. policy under Obama toward Israel and Iran has turned Silverman off from the President. And from Clinton: \u201cAbsolutely, absolutely,\u201d Silverman said. Ellen and Bob Hausner, a married couple of nearly 30 years divided along party lines, said they have finally found a point of agreement \u2013 or mutual disapproval \u2013 on politics. (Hint: She\u2019s a pantsuit aficionado and the leading Democratic candidate for president.) \u201cI would say a lot of people are disenchanted with the Democratic Party. People down here in particular,\u201d said Ellen, the Democrat in the family. \u201cThey have issues with the Iran deal now. They have issues with what\u2019s happening domestically, and they just have lost confidence and respect in Obama. And I don\u2019t think they\u2019re particularly supportive of Hillary.\u201d Bob, a Republican, gleefully eyed his wife in agreement. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Sitting inside the deli after eating what he called \u201cthe finest pastrami,\u201d Eugene Rudoy said his 2008 support for Hillary Clinton is no barometer of his feelings on the 2016 race. \u201cIf you bring me to today, I wouldn\u2019t support her,\u201d the 84-year-old Boyton Beach resident said. \u201cShe\u2019s just an extension of Obama.\u201d Clinton is already working to fight that perception when it comes to Israel, cognizant of Jewish voters\u2019 distrust of Obama\u2019s policies toward Israel and Iran. While Clinton backs Obama\u2019s Iran deal \u2013 which Israel opposes \u2013 the former secretary of state, who helped launch the negotiations, committed to ensuring Israel\u2019s security and to confronting Iranian aggression in the same breath as she announced her support for the deal in September. And in a letter to several top Jewish donors and pro-Israel leaders this summer, Clinton expressed her staunch opposition to calls to boycott Israel and pledged to fight the boycott movement. The Clinton campaign on Thursday dismissed any concern that its support among Jewish voters could be in jeopardy. Clinton campaign spokesman Jesse Lehrich touted her \u201ccommitment to our unshakeable alliance with Israel,\u201d citing her work to promote security cooperation with Israel and brokering a ceasefire that ended clashes between Israel and Hamas in 2012. \u201cHillary Clinton has always had a deep connection to Jewish-American voters, and she is honored to continue to have strong support from that community,\u201d Lehrich said in an email to CNN. \u201cShe\u2019s made clear that continuing to strengthen this partnership will be a top priority of her presidency. For her, this goes beyond policy; it\u2019s personal.\u201d Despite talk of a slide in Jewish support for the Democratic Party since Obama\u2019s election in 2008, Jewish voters still turned out in droves for Obama in 2012. Obama\u2019s share of the Jewish vote slipped to 69% from 74%, based on exit polling, a fall that mimicked drops among other typically pro-Democratic voting blocs. Though Jews make up about 2% of the national population, they comprised 5% of voters in Florida that year, also according to exit polls. While still a small fraction of the total, every vote in the crucial battleground state is hotly contested. Florida\u2019s Jewish population also tends to be older and less progressive than Jews in many other parts of the country, making them more inclined toward hawkish positions on the Middle East. READ: Hillary Clinton opposes Israel boycott, unilateral moves on peace process Kenneth Wald, a political science professor at the University of Florida who has studied the Jewish vote throughout his career, said that while there\u2019s a clear \u201cunease\u201d about Obama\u2019s policies toward Israel among American Jews, he would \u201cbe surprised if that crystallizes into a significant political shift.\u201d \u201cFor as long as I\u2019ve been studying Jewish voters, people keep telling me this is the year we\u2019re going to see the transformation,\u201d he said. \u201cI just think that this is stuff that happens between elections and the atmosphere changes when you actually get into choice.\u201d And the Clintons, he said, still enjoy \u201ca very deep well of attachment\u201d among Jewish voters. Unfortunately for Clinton, though, her staunchest supporter outside the Boca Raton delicatessen last Friday refused to be named for fear that her friends would mistakenly think she\u2019s anti-Israel. \u201cA lot of my friends, family \u2013 some of whom are Democrats \u2013 do not feel that Obama is for Israel. It\u2019s plain and simple,\u201d she said. She said she was not concerned \u201cat all\u201d about the strength of Clinton\u2019s support for Israel and said that while she waffles on whether the Iran deal is good, she is hopeful it will result in a peaceful outcome. She also hopes that one of her own reasons for supporting Clinton will resonate with fellow Jewish voters. \u201cPeople know the Clintons and I think that that will reign over anything else,\u201d she said. \u201cYou know, voting for Hillary is voting for two presidents, not one president. So you\u2019re getting two for the price of one. And a lot of Jewish voters loved Bill.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Kentucky Republicans will vote Saturday on changing election rules If GOP keeps current rules, Paul would be able to run for president and senator in Kentucky Rand Paul has a choice: Spend nearly half a million dollars to keep his increasingly longshot presidential ambitions alive in his home state or leave the Senate. For now, he\u2019s choosing to pony up. Paul\u2019s political future rests partially in the hands of nearly 350 Republican officials in Kentucky, who will decide Saturday whether to approve a costly plan that would allow him to run in Kentucky for president and the U.S. Senate simultaneously\u2014and possibly salvage his chances of staying in electoral politics after 2016. The proposal, which acts as a work-around of a state law that forbids candidates in Kentucky from running for two federal offices at the same time, would establish a presidential caucus in early March in addition to the state primary scheduled two months later. If it\u2019s approved, Paul would be allowed to run for president in Kentucky during the March caucus and also for his Senate seat in the May primary. But if it\u2019s turned down, Paul would be forced to give up his Senate seat in exchange for a chance to win any presidential delegates from his home state. (The state legislature shot down a bill last year that would have changed the law so candidates could appear twice on a the same primary ballot.) Party officials estimate the March 5 caucus will cost about $500,000, and require 400 work hours on the day of the event. While Paul\u2019s campaign is optimistic that the Kentucky GOP central committee will approve the change in plans, lingering concerns remain among state Republican officials about the cost of holding an expensive, time-intensive caucus with such short notice. And the decision comes at at time when Paul is sinking in the polls, overshadowed by Republicans like Donald Trump and struggling to break through the presidential pack. READ: Post-debate, Trump pulls clear of competition \u201cPeople are very much supportive of seeing Sen. Paul further his efforts to become president. The stark reality becomes do we have the money to pay for it?\u201d said Republican Robert Stivers, the president of the state Senate. \u201cIt has been more of a money concern than anything else.\u201d In a last-minute effort to alleviate such concerns, Paul\u2019s campaign took the extraordinary step of pledging to pay most of the costs out-of-pocket. Earlier this week, his campaign deposited $250,000 into a state party account, but the Lexington Herald-Leader reported Tuesday the funds had not yet been deposited. \u201cI will fully fund this caucus,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cI want to make sure NO COUNTY CHAIR or (the Republican Party of Kentucky) will be on the hook for ANY money for this caucus.\u201d The rest of the required funds, Paul proposed, would be raised by charging other campaigns that choose to participate in the caucus through a $15,000 per candidate access fee. On the ground in Kentucky, Paul\u2019s team has also engaged in a statewide lobbying effort to convince central committee members to support the plan by assuring them it won\u2019t cost the state party. \u201cThey\u2019re really trying hard,\u201d Adair County Republican Chairman Shannon Rowe told CNN. \u201cThey\u2019re being pretty aggressive.\u201d Later this week, Paul\u2014who is currently in Haiti providing pro-bono eye surgery as part of a summer mission trip\u2014will host a conference call with voting committee members to provide more details for his funding plan, his campaign told CNN. READ: Donald Trump sinks GOP\u2019s 2016 dream team When the state party\u2019s executive committee first proposed the plan earlier this spring, Paul\u2019s presidential campaign was soaring. The junior senator was heralded in Time magazine as \u201cthe most interesting man in politics,\u201d and he was in the top tier of presidential polls. But over the past few months, the emergence of other candidates\u2014particularly real estate mogul Donald Trump\u2014combined with Paul\u2019s fundraising struggles and the indictment of the campaign\u2019s close allies on conspiracy charges stemming back to Paul\u2019s father\u2019s 2008 presidential run, Rand Paul has struggled to regain his footing. The effort began as a way to pave the way for what appeared to be a sure-to-be competitive native son in the spring, but Paul\u2019s decline in the polls has left some voting members less enthusiastic about the move. \u201cI think a lot of folks suspected they\u2019d be a bit tighter,\u201d Scott Lasley, a Kentucky GOP official, told CNN. The latest CNN/ORC presidential poll puts Paul in the middle of the pack with just 6% support among registered Republican voters nationally. Talk of Paul\u2019s success as a reason for holding the caucus \u201chas not come up as frequently,\u201d Lasley said. \u201cThat\u2019s gone from about 80 percent of the people I\u2019ve talked to from about ten person of people who bring that up now.\u201d Regardless of Paul\u2019s chances, party officials also see it as an opportunity to make Kentucky more relevant in the presidential process. As a state that traditionally holds its election in late spring\u2014a time when White House primaries are often no longer competitive\u2014candidates largely ignore the state or don\u2019t see it as a campaign priority. But moving the contest to early March could finally make the Bluegrass State a player in presidential politics. \u201cWe\u2019re ignored. It has been pretty boring in presidential races,\u201d Lasley said. \u201cThe most attractive part for a lot of folks is whether or not this will attract attention to Kentucky and make us relevant in the Republican nomination process.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A century ago, party bosses ruled cities. Today, super PACs are in charge. Elections in the nation\u2019s cities are increasingly the territory of deep-pocketed donors who are finding that a dollar spent in a low-cost municipal race can easily put an ally in power. In Philadelphia, where Democratic voters will effectively choose the next mayor on Tuesday, the city\u2019s wealthiest are overwhelming its candidates, flushing super PACs with more money than ever before. Three Philadelphia donors with a super PAC will outspend all the other candidates combined by a wide margin, demonstrating just how deeply big money is becoming a part of modern campaigns at every level. Super PACs are posing nearly identical challenges to operatives and candidates in Philadelphia as they are nationwide, raising concerns about coordination and hypocrisy. From Chicago to to Anchorage, Alaska, elections for City Hall are more and more becoming indistinguishable from elections for the White House: one donor can define a campaign and pluck a winner. \u201cWhen it\u2019s all said and done, the money\u2019s almost inexhaustible,\u201d said Terry Madonna, an independent pollster and a longtime Philadelphia political observer. Super PACs, which can accept unlimited donations from individuals and corporations as long as their spending isn\u2019t coordinated with the campaign, have moved from ornamental additions to a presidential campaign to an essential part of any serious bid for the presidency. And in this year\u2019s mayoral races, the outside spending game is drowning what could be spent by the campaigns themselves. RELATED: Clinton\u2019s super PAC fundraising irks progressives \u201cThey\u2019re not historically subject to the same level of giant spending,\u201d said Robert Weissman of Public Citizen, which has studied how groups making independent expenditures can influence downballot races. \u201cIt\u2019s not been part of the story, by and large, in the United States \u2013 until now.\u201d Becky Carroll, who ran Chicago Forward, a super PAC supporting Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel in his reelection campaign, defended the groups as giving donors another choice when confronted by city laws that rule out big checks. \u201cThey\u2019re the shiny new object in campaigns today, and they provide new flexibility \u2013 especially in municipalities and states where there\u2019s far more stringent control,\u201d said Carroll. Super PACs in Philadelphia spent six times as much as did the campaigns, which are hamstrung by tight contribution limits of $2,900 for an individual or $11,500 for a political action committee. That\u2019s given room for three wealthy traders from Philadelphia\u2019s suburbs to dominate the election in the City of Brotherly Love. The men who run the Susquehanna International Group spent nearly $7 million to back Anthony Williams, a state senator who shares his patrons\u2019 positions on education reform. 97% of the money for the super PAC, American Cities, has come from them. And the operatives in Philadelphia are learning that these new spending vehicles have all the same drawbacks that they do at the national level. At least three lessons have flowed from the national oracles to the local rough and tumble. For starters: Much like in the race for the White House, no super PAC exists in isolation. Williams\u2019 opponent, Jim Kenney, is backed by the teachers\u2019 unions and labor movement who have set up their own spending groups to counterpunch American Cities. Threatened by a super PAC that supports charter schools, labor created their own super PAC to at least neutralize the spending game. They haven\u2019t quite succeeded. The pro-Williams group has dwarfed the pro-Kenney group with more than twice as much spending. But Philadelphia is learning a second rule that Senate and presidential candidates came to understand in previous cycles: More money doesn\u2019t always mean more votes. A Philadelphia Inquirer poll last week showed Kenney with a surprisingly large 27-point lead over Williams despite the mismatched spending arsenals. Some race-watchers say Williams has partially been a victim of his own super PACs\u2019 weight. American Cities\u2019 television spots have focused primarily on the education issues near and dear to their donors \u2013 but not necessarily the paid media assault the Williams campaign would execute if it controlled the budget. Sam Katz, who unsuccessfully bid for mayor three times before, said Williams was hurt by not having a super PAC attack and define Kenney \u2013 as the groups seem to relish in doing on the national level. But those same coordination problems trickled down to a mayor\u2019s race. \u201cIt exposed a disconnect between what the advocates were saying about school choice and between what Tony Williams was trying to tell people he was for,\u201d Katz explained. \u201cThe lack of coordination was very damaging.\u201d The mixed messages, Katz said, created an issue-less campaign that \u201cbored the crap out of the public.\u201d One issue though that did break through was, ironically, campaign finance. Much like the presidential hopefuls, Philadelphia\u2019s mayoral candidates tried to use campaign finance as a winning issue while taking advantage of the status quo. Despite the campaigns depending on an onslaught of outside spending, candidates quarreled over how to change the role of money in politics. Williams and Kenney have sparred with their opponents over how far they would go to require greater transparency from groups that make independent expenditures, such as \u201cdark money\u201d groups that spend money without disclosing their donors. That contradiction \u2013 which detractors blast as hypocritical \u2013 mirrors the national conversation over campaign finance. Hillary Clinton has called for a constitutional amendment to rein in the avalanche of outside spending, but this month embraced the super PAC prepared to spend big to put her in the White House. Her Republican opponents field questions in town halls on money\u2019s role in politics, all the while courting billionaires at lavish resorts years before a single vote is cast. Kenney and Williams have endorsed a ban on dark money, but they have also made sure to note that the donors to their super PACs are disclosed. Those social welfare groups may be the new frontier in local elections, some operatives predict. Alaska political strategist Art Hackney formed a super PAC in Anchorage that struggled to gain traction after the donor base grew skittish about attaching their name to their contribution. That\u2019s the same fear that drives donors to dark money groups nationally and made them the favored vehicle of the moment.

            "article_content": "Florida Sen. Marco Rubio says he won\u2019t wait his turn to run for president because there\u2019s no time for the outdated ideas of politicians from \u201cyesterday.\u201d In other words: Move over, grandma and grandpa. The youngest candidate in the 2016 field made the most explicit case yet that the 67-year-old Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s time has passed \u2013 a point the other first-term Republican senators in the race, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have also pressed in their own ways. READ: Rubio announces presidential bid \u201cThis election is a generational choice about what kind of country we will be,\u201d Rubio said Monday night as he kicked off his bid for the White House. The 43-year-old first-generation American whose parents fled from Cuba took a major risk by launching his campaign just a day after Clinton announced her own. His bet: Rather than being drowned out by coverage of the much-better-known Clinton, he\u2019d capitalize on the stirring contrast. \u201cJust yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cYesterday is over \u2013 and we\u2019re never going back.\u201d Unnamed but implicit in that critique is also Jeb Bush, 62, who won the Florida governor\u2019s office in the late 1990s and hails from a similarly famous political family. Like Clinton, he\u2019s a grandparent \u2013 his fourth grandchild came Monday with the birth of his son George P. Bush\u2019s child. Rubio offered a similar take on Bush \u2013 in a softer tone than his attack on Clinton \u2013 during an interview Monday night with ABC, when he said the former Florida governor \u201ccontinues to be a model\u201d but shouldn\u2019t be the GOP\u2019s standard-bearer himself. Sen. Marco Rubio announces presidential run \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a moment now, not just in my career but in the history of our country, where I believe that it needs a Republican Party that is new and vibrant, that understands the future, has an agenda for that future. And I feel uniquely qualified to offer that,\u201d Rubio said in the interview. Paul has been on the attack against Clinton in recent days as well. His campaign launched a new television ad on Sunday during which a narrator asks if America is set to take \u201ca path to the past \u2013 a road to yesterday, to a place we\u2019ve been to before?\u201d Cruz used similar rhetoric, saying in a video Sunday that Clinton \u201crepresents the failed policies of the past.\u201d But it\u2019s not just a criticism limited to individual candidates. The GOP has long eyed Clinton as their Democratic rival and pounded the narrative that\u2019s she\u2019s old news. It\u2019s a drumbeat that\u2019s only gotten louder since Sunday. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus told CNN on Monday that Clinton is \u201cbringing the same-old, same-old to the table\u201d in her just-launched campaign. The RNC chief compared Clinton\u2019s tactics \u2013 kicking off her bid for the Democratic nomination with a cross-country van trip from New York to Iowa \u2013 with her first solo political campaign, the 2000 Senate race in New York. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing new with Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. It\u2019s the same exact thing that she did \u2013 what, now, 15 years ago,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing new there to see.\u201d Their change-agent arguments echo Clinton\u2019s last opponent, Barack Obama in 2008, signaling the three senators see the upside of a comparison that their freshman status will earn them anyway. It\u2019s a tricky case to make, since Republicans have also argued that Obama \u2013 himself a freshman senator when he defeated Clinton for the 2008 Democratic nomination \u2013 was too inexperienced for the job. \u201cEveryone brings different talents to the table,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Obama\u2019s experience that was an issue. It was the things that he did as a state senator in Illinois and people he hung around and the things he didn\u2019t do when he was a U.S. senator. So, I mean, you take each case one by one.\u201d Faced with a tough electoral map, Republicans are seeking to broaden their outreach \u2013 with the three freshman senators, in particular, courting younger voters. Alexandra Smith, the College Republican National Committee\u2019s national chair, said it\u2019s not about age, but \u201ctrying to show a dichotomy between old and new ideas \u2013 not so much a generational shift, but a shift in our thinking.\u201d A spokesman for Clinton\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t return CNN\u2019s request for a comment. Paul Begala, a long-time Clinton family ally who is a senior adviser to the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action, said Clinton\u2019s argument isn\u2019t her experience \u2013 it\u2019s that \u201cshe can make the system work for you.\u201d \u201cI suspect her message will be based on the values and priorities of the middle class \u2013 asking people who will be more likely to make the system work for ordinary Americans. That\u2019s where her experience comes in,\u201d said Begala, also a CNN political commentator. Democrats see a crucial difference in the attacks Republicans like Rubio are making now and the jabs Obama\u2019s ascendant campaign took against Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary. Begala argued that Republicans won\u2019t be able to back up their generation-change rhetoric with similarly forward-looking policy ideas. \u201cIf the Republicans want to claim they\u2019re new, they\u2019re going to need some new ideas,\u201d he said. \u201cPrivatizing Social Security is not a new idea. Voucherizing Medicare is not a new idea. Cutting taxes for the rich is not a new idea. Discriminating against our LGBT sisters and brothers is not a new idea. In fact, I can\u2019t think of a single economic idea from the Republicans that Herbert Hoover wasn\u2019t in favor of in 1932.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ted Cruz backers have ushered in a new era for super PACs. Supporters of the Texas Republican presidential candidate made a bombshell announcement this week \u2014 that a network of four affiliated super PACs will have raised an eye-popping $31 million by the end of the week. The disclosure, coming within weeks of Cruz launching his campaign for president, has sent deep ripples through the political fundraising world. The idea of not one, but multiple, affiliated super PACs ostensibly working together to haul in donations for the same presidential candidate is unprecedented, campaign finance experts say. Ted Cruz: I can do bipartisanship READ: Network of Cruz super PACs boasts big haul Veteran fundraisers point out that the strategy could give already powerful donors never-before-seen levels of influence \u2014 and choice \u2014 over how their dollars are spent to help a presidential candidate. The unique setup is aimed at giving mega donors \u201cinfluence and control over the expenditures\u201d they are funding, explained Dathan Voelter, an Austin-based attorney and treasurer to three of the four super PACs. As political strategists and campaign finance experts scramble to assess just what this all means for the future of political fundraising, one thing seems clear: Wealthy donors are most certainly about to get more powerful \u2013 not less. \u201cMy bet is that it all has to do with the donors \u2013 donors having different views of what the super PAC should do,\u201d said Cleta Mitchell, a political law attorney at Foley & Lardner, who summed up the strategy as \u201cvery unusual.\u201d \u201cSo rather than having internal arguments about it, they just established different super PACs,\u201d she said. Campaign finance reformers have for years spoken out against the oversized influence of deep-pocketed donors in the political system. There was no bigger blow to their cause than the Supreme Court\u2019s historic Citizens United ruling in 2010, which allowed for super PACs \u2014 a kind of political action committee \u2014 to accept unlimited amounts of contributions from various entities including, individuals, corporations and unions. Cruz: Not our place to dictate to Israel SEE: Paul best GOP bet in three swing states, poll says In recent election cycles, a handful of high-profile, mega-wealthy donors have spent unprecedented sums of money through super PACs, supporting or attacking political candidates often with an eye towards achieving a narrower cause. Liberal billionaire and environmentalist Tom Steyer; pro-Israel conservative casino magnate Sheldon Adelson; and wealthy businessmen Charles and David Koch \u2014 better known to many as simply the \u201cKoch brothers\u201d \u2014 have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into super PACs to influence elections. One Republican strategist who leads a major GOP super PAC called the multi-super PAC strategy a \u201cbrilliant move\u201d that offers potential donors an \u201ca la carte\u201d menu of super PACs to consider. \u201cA super PAC might go into a pitch and say here\u2019s our plan to win: We\u2019re going to tear down Bush. And a donor might say, \u201cNah, I\u2019m not interested,\u2019\u201d said the strategist, who declined to speak on the record so as not to expose their clients. \u201cBut now, they walk in and they say, \u2018We\u2019re going to have data, we\u2019re going to model the voters, do rallies, tear down Bush and build up Ted.\u2019 And the donor says, \u2018All right, I\u2019m interested in that one, this one and that.\u2019\u201d So far, there are four super PACs pulling in cash to benefit Cruz\u2019s campaign: Keep the Promise PAC, Keep the Promise PAC I, Keep the Promise PAC II and Keep the Promise PAC III. Each is tethered to a big donor or donor family. Voelter said more could spring up if another big enough donor walks onto the scene \u2013 a Keep the Promise IV, for example. The four PACs can solicit unlimited amounts of money, thanks to the Citizens United ruling, and can coordinate amongst each other but are banned from working with Cruz\u2019s campaign. The $31 million amount cannot be independently verified until the next Federal Election Commission disclosure deadline. If it\u2019s accurate, that starting figure would easily top the $23 million the Winning Our Future super PAC hauled in \u2013 mostly from Adelson \u2013 to buoy Newt Gingrich\u2019s 2012 primary bid, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Voelter said the super PAC setup sprang up after a \u201cgroup of donors\u201d started looking for ways to contribute to the election effort but also \u201caddress some of the shortcomings\u201d of past super PAC efforts. Austin Barbour, who runs a pro-Rick Perry super PAC, said it\u2019s not unusual for most generous donors to want to have heavy sway over a PAC. \u201cDonors want to know how you\u2019re spending the money. Donors want to know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Barbour said. The setup has  prompted a lot of head-scratching among campaign finance experts who question the upsides of the fragmented organization. \u201cI don\u2019t think there are any efficiency gains from doing it this way \u2013 the accounting headaches are not insignificant having been on that end of trying to report stuff like this,\u201d said David Keating, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a group that tracks political spending. \u201cIt seems like a big hassle.\u201d Regardless, the super PACs have given a big boost for Cruz, who few expected to attract this kind of a hefty financial backing in such a short period of time. \u201cPeople were saying you know Cruz is good and he\u2019s a conservative and this and that, but he\u2019s not going to be able to raise money and he\u2019s not going to be able to win,\u201d campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said of the super PAC haul. \u201cI knew it would be over and it\u2019s over.\u201d Meanwhile, the Cruz campaign has also made strong inroads in the first weeks of his official candidacy, raising more than $4 million in eight days after Cruz launched his bid, mostly from small donors. This is a clear sign, Cruz allies say, of his viability in what is expected to be a crowded Republican field. \u201cIt\u2019s just very difficult to get out your message when you don\u2019t have the resources to do it. Here we have a conservative who actually can raise money,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cAnd not just grassroots money, but major donor money.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Mike Pence is the first victim of America\u2019s new culture war. The Republican governor of Indiana thought he was doing what 19 other states and the federal government had done \u2013 without inciting national controversy \u2013 by signing a new religious freedom law. When charges that the law opens doors to discrimination against gays and lesbians came, his technical arguments about what is and isn\u2019t allowed under the law were feeble in the face of outrage. Pence found himself confronting a new political reality in a country where battles over gay rights now appear to have a clear winner. Indiana governor wants to fix state's new law READ: Pence says he wasn\u2019t expecting backlash And by signing a law that Republicans had thought offered sturdier ground \u2013 religious liberty \u2013 than the same-sex marriage debate they\u2019re close to losing, Pence brought on the force of a fully realigned coalition. Instead of remaining in a tense partnership with social conservatives, fiscally focused Republicans and businesses that now see opposing gay rights as far too costly broke away from their traditional GOP allies and flatly rejected Indiana\u2019s law. They\u2019d also planted an important flag, making clear that they\u2019d come to view the legislation as a new, coded proxy for the same old issue. That such a view hardened so quickly only further infuriated conservatives who feel their religious freedom is under assault. And it raised the stakes for Republican presidential contenders who now must articulate a more effective version of his argument. The imbroglio has wounded Pence, a sometimes-mentioned potential White House aspirant. More important, though, is that the 2016 Republican field was drawn into the fight. And they sided with Pence. They had little choice: A competitive primary means Republican candidates must win over a much more socially conservative set of voters before they can even begin courting a more diverse general electorate. That, polling data suggests, could be a ticking time bomb that hurts the party in a general election. What's next for Indiana? SEE: Arkansas poised to adopt religious freedom law \u201cWe\u2019re headed to the point where a political candidate who is perceived as anti-gay at the presidential level will never connect with people under 30 years old,\u201d GOP pollster Whit Ayers said Tuesday at a breakfast hosted by the Christian Science Monitor. The Indiana debate revealed that the gay rights movement has a powerful set of allies \u2013 all strong enough to sway the voting public. The sports world, historically reticent to wade into politics, strongly opposed Pence\u2019s decision to sign the law. The NFL, NBA and even NASCAR lambasted it. Nike called it \u201cdiscriminatory.\u201d But the most potent condemnation came from the NCAA, which is headquartered in Indianapolis and is set to host its men\u2019s basketball Final Four there this week. Tech giants like Apple, Yelp and Salesforce also sided with pro-LGBT critics of Indiana\u2019s law. Their positions were no surprise. But Eli Lilly, Levis and Walmart also waded into the debate, with the retailer training its fire on Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, whose state legislature on Monday sent him a bill mirroring Indiana\u2019s. Walmart\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, said the bill \u201cthreatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.\u201d The comment, from the state\u2019s most important business, was a warning shot at the 14 others considering similar proposals this year that advancing them will come at a cost. Pence has since vacillated on the law, alternating between supporting it, saying it should be \u201cfixed\u201d and blasting a media that he says has mischaracterized the whole thing. RELATED: Indiana law reveals GOP\u2019s challenge First Pence called Indianapolis Star editorial writer Tim Swarens on Saturday to say he wanted lawmakers to clarify it. Then he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday that the law wouldn\u2019t be changed. On Tuesday, he called a press conference to say he wants it to be \u201cfixed\u201d so it\u2019s clear businesses like Christian florists, bakers and photographers can\u2019t refuse to serve a same-sex wedding. Then on Tuesday night, Pence said on Sean Hannity\u2019s radio show: \u201cI stand by this law. The law doesn\u2019t need to be fixed.\u201d The wreckage around Pence was easy to see. The buzz around his potential White House run was gone. His 2012 Democratic opponent, John Gregg, was chirping to anyone who would listen that he\u2019s now even more likely to take another shot at Pence in 2016. Evan Bayh, the former Indiana governor and senator and the only Democrat whose popularity can rival Pence\u2019s among Hoosiers, laid into the governor in an interview with The Huffington Post, saying the Republican ought to hire a lawyer to help him understand what he\u2019d signed. If his way of handling the debate was the wrong one \u2013 is there a better way to sell his position? Bob Vander Plaats, a socially conservative power broker in the Iowa caucuses, said Republican candidates will need to find one because \u201creligious liberty is going to be a key issue in the 2016 race.\u201d Potential 2016 presidential candidates \u201cI think it\u2019s always important how you message things without abandoning or violating your principles. All of us understand that,\u201d Vander Plaats said in an interview. But with the Supreme Court set to rule on same-sex marriage in June, he said, \u201cwhat\u2019s going to happen is religious liberty, the issue of marriage and the role of the courts are going to be three of the biggest issues not only in the primary election but in the general election because they are center stage.\u201d Several 2016 candidates \u2013 including Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Ben Carson and Scott Walker \u2013 offered support for religious freedom laws. Their challenge is selling it beyond their conservative base. Rubio looked more at ease than Pence during an appearance on Fox News Monday night. He jabbed at Pence slightly only by saying he thought the questions ABC\u2019s Stephanopoulos asked were fair \u2013 and then he admitted what Pence would not. \u201cNobody is saying that it should be legal to deny someone service at a restaurant or at a hotel because of their sexual orientation. I think that\u2019s a consensus view in America,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThe flip side is, should a photographer be punished for refusing to do a wedding that their faith teaches them is not one that is valid in the eyes of God?\u201d Cruz, meanwhile, portrayed Indiana as the new front in a cultural battle. \u201cIndiana is giving voice to millions of courageous conservatives across this country who are deeply concerned about the ongoing attacks upon our personal liberties,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to stand with Mike, and I urge Americans to do the same.\u201d But the new alignment of the business and sports world could push voters more focused on fiscal issues and national security away from the Republican Party. That, Ayers said, is why GOP contenders who hope to be viable in a general election must adopt \u201ca tone and an attitude of inclusion and acceptance.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The lead up to Hillary Clinton\u2019s speech to a Democratic women\u2019s group in Washington on Tuesday night was focused on two things: The controversy around her exclusive use of personal emails at the State Department and questions around her family foundation\u2019s fundraising practices. Her speech, however, was not. Clinton failed to mention any aspect of the two stories that dominated all coverage of Clinton over the past week, instead using her speech to 1,600 mostly women Democratic activists to focus on her vision of the future, the importance of electing women to office and her all-but-announced presidential plans. Report: Clinton had no official State Dept. email address READ: 4 reasons to care about Clinton\u2019s email \u201cDon\u2019t you someday want to see a woman president of the Untied States?\u201d asked the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in 2016 at Emily\u2019s List\u2019s 30th anniversary celebration gala. Clinton\u2019s campaign has long been seen as a forgone conclusion. The former secretary state and her aides are already putting the pieces in place for a campaign team and Clinton is encouraging all assumption by openly teasing her aspirations in speeches. \u201cAlong life\u2019s way you get a chance to make millions of decisions, some of them are big like do you run for office,\u201d she said on Tuesday with a smile. As she has done in the past, Clinton embraced what many Democrats expect to be the defining issue of the 2016 election: Economic inequality. \u201cIf we remember how to work and grow together, we can help more families find their footing in the middle class and make sure every one of our kids has a fair shot to climb that ladder of opportunity,\u201d Clinton said, after imploring Washington to work together \u201cfor everyday Americans whose grit and hard work drove our comeback and have always been the backbone of our prosperity.\u201d Hillary Clinton's potential challengers The former New York senator gave a sizable - and new \u2013 nod to her party\u2019s labor union base, too. \u201cAs a nation,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cwe know that the American middle class was built, in part, by the right for people to organize and bargain on behalf of themselves.\u201d The acknowledgement could be seen as a knock against Republican Gov. Scott Walker, whose successful and defining political fight against labor unions\u2019 collective bargaining rights launched him to Republican prominence and, possibly, a run for president. Clinton also knocked Republicans more broadly during the speech, telling the receptive audience that Democrats have only recently seen the GOP \u201csing out of the same hymnal\u201d on economic issues. Other Democrats, including President Barack Obama, have made that case, charging that Republicans have paid more lip service to the problem of economic inequality ahead of the 2016 campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s like watching the end of Casablanca,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOh my goodness, oh my goodness, people are talking about it. Round up the usual suspects.\u2019\u201d Democrats shouldn\u2019t \u201cwant to discourage their new found interest,\u201d though, Clinton said. \u201cWe welcome them to come with their ideas, and we will match them,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd that is what elections should be about. Elections should be contests of ideas.\u201d Just as Clinton went after Republicans, she nodded to a number of prominent Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator that some liberals are trying to draft to run against Clinton in 2016. \u201cIt is because of you that Elizabeth Warren can work to hold Wall Street accountable,\u201d Clinton said of Emily\u2019s List, which has worked to elect pro-choice, Democratic women to office for the last 30 years. The group has long been supportive of Clinton and leaders have made it clear \u2013 again on Tuesday \u2013 they would be love to back the former first lady for a White House bid. The group pledged to outspend and out-fundraise their 2014 goals for a Clinton run,  they told CNN last week. \u201cIn 2016, it is time to shatter that glass ceiling and put a woman in the White House,\u201d said Ellen Malcolm, the group\u2019s founder. \u201cIt is time to finish the job. We want Hillary Clinton to be president of the United States.\u201d With Clinton sitting just feet from the stage and hearing nothing but applause and roars from the audience, Malcolm continued, \u201cWell, Hillary. You heard us. Just give us the word and we will be right at your side. We\u2019re ready to fight and we\u2019re ready to win in 2016.\u201d",

With their surprise decision to grant the Peace Prize to Tunisia\u2019s National Dialogue Quartet, the Committee unlocked the rusted gates of memory, flooding the present with images and emotions from the early days of the pro-democracy uprisings in the Middle East, when we still used the words \u201cArab Spring\u201d without a hint of irony. This is the second time this decade that the world\u2019s most prestigious award has gone to activists working to bring democracy to an Arab country. But awarding this year\u2019s prize to the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet reflects a maturing of the process against a backdrop of a regional crisis that reminds us that the stakes are even higher than we realized when the Arab Spring first exploded. It began in December 2010 in Tunisia, before spreading across the region. The following year, Yemen\u2019s Tawakul Karman, a key democracy activist, was selected as one of the Peace Prize winners. Since then, though, Yemen has descended into a catastrophic war. Meanwhile, other countries where the people rose up to topple dictators and demand democracy have also seen outcomes that seem to mock the high-minded efforts of those who launched the revolution. Syria, for example, has become a killing field, a maelstrom of carnage and ideological poison that is now spilling into many other countries. Libya is also in turmoil, a failed state. Egypt, which followed Tunisia\u2019s example in the earlier days of the uprisings, has reverted to harsh authoritarian rule. And then there\u2019s Tunisia \u2013 and this well-deserved, deeply poignant Nobel Peace Prize choice. In choosing the Quartet \u2013 comprising the Tunisian General Labor Union, the Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts, the Tunisian Human Rights League, and the Tunisian Order of Lawyers \u2013 the Nobel Prize committee seemed to be saying to the Middle East, \u201cLook at Tunisia. It\u00a0can\u00a0work. It is possible to solve political differences without war.\u201d And by explaining that it was not awarding the prize to any single group but instead to the Quartet they formed, the Committee no doubt sought to highlight the inclusive nature of the Tunisian process, which, to the entire world\u2019s astonishment, appears so far to be succeeding. Remember, democratic success in that tiny North African country was never guaranteed, and at times it looked like it was about to go off the rails. And many challenges still remain. But thanks in large part to the Quartet\u2019s carefully calibrated efforts, Tunisia has a good chance of showing the Arab world that democracy is possible. This would be fitting, because it was a Tunisian man, the street vendor Mohamed Bouazizi, who inadvertently launched the pro-democracy revolutions half a decade ago when he set himself on fire in despair over abuses from government officials. But although he could not have known what his act would spark, it quickly became clear that even a single vendor could shake the world. Back then I wrote that \u201cWe didn\u2019t need a gifted oracle, eminent historian or brilliant political scientist to tell us that the Mideast will one day undergo drastic changes. And we know that an earthquake in that part of the world can set off a giant tsunami. That\u2019s why what happened in Tunisia matters everywhere.\u201d Yet the fact that the push for democratic change has succeeded in Tunisia while it has failed elsewhere owes much to the Quartet. That\u2019s because there have been many times when Tunisia, too, seemed set to lose its way \u2013 two major democratic leaders were assassinated, Islamist parties and liberal activists clashed, and ISIS-linked terrorists have carried out mass-casualty terrorist attacks while recruiting thousands of Tunisians to fight in Syria. Nobel Prize in literature goes to ... So, when opposing political groups seemed unable to agree on the path forward, and when it seemed peaceful resolution of political disputes could not be reached, conflict looked possible. That is until the Quartet \u2013 made up of influential, respected but mostly non-political players \u2013 helped devise a path forward. After guiding negotiations between Islamists, liberals, and others, the Quarter prodded all of Tunisia\u2019s main political groups to sign on to the Road Map, which set out the way towards a transitional government, a new constitution, and a successful election. The process itself, meanwhile, arguably helped set the tone that made all the main players became more conciliatory, more willing to compromise even after elections were held. Of course, Tunisia\u2019s success to date is not only the result of the Quartet\u2019s work \u2013 the country had better odds than any of its neighbors. Even before the Arab Spring, Tunisia, nestled on the Mediterranean Sea with a bustling European tourism industry, had one of the most liberal, most educated populations in the Arab Middle East. Even its Islamist party, Ennahda, was more flexible than most of its counterparts in the region. And yet, Tunisia also faced, as it still does, many of the same problems that doomed other revolutions, including high levels of corruption, ideological extremism, and deep economic problems. History suggests that any celebration of democratic progress should be tempered because there are no guarantees for Tunisia, and there is faint optimism for other countries struggling with war. But all that said, today is still a moment to celebrate the way in which the Tunisia Quartet has demonstrated inspiring, indigenous, method of conflict revolution. The Nobel Peace Prize has shone a bright spotlight on the Quartet\u2019s work, and the way it has itself sent a small ray of light across the Middle East. In doing so, it has revived memories of a more hopeful time, and dares to suggest that maybe, just maybe, the optimism of the past can bear fruit in the future. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of the new book \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Julian Zelizer: Elizabeth Warren was defiant about Wall Street, but Hillary Clinton likely won't be Zelizer: The Democrats need Wall Street's campaign donations to be competitive in 2016 In response to reports of big banks threatening to withhold campaign funds from Senate Democrats, Sen. Elizabeth Warren last week offered a defiant response: \u201cBring it on.\u201d Warren said she isn\u2019t going to slack off on her calls for breaking up banks and other measures to rein in Wall Street. As Hillary Clinton prepares to officially launch her presidential campaign this month, she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who is also running for the Democratic nomination, is trying to steal Clinton\u2019s thunder by talking about the problems of disproportionate wealth. In other words, there are many signs that Democrats are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality. But in other recent news, the likelihood that New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer will replace Harry Reid as leader of the Senate Democrats means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality. While Schumer has been a very effective Democrat and skilled legislative leader, he is also a Wall Street Democrat who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state. He is not alone. Even at his most progressive moments, President Barack Obama relied on Wall Street donations for both of his campaigns. Despite all the talk from conservatives about left-wing \u201csocialism\u201d in the White House, the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to Democrats without much concern, even in the 2012 election. Democratic populism can\u2019t really work within the current campaign finance system.  The enormous pressures for parties to raise funds in campaigns has for many decades created pressure on Democrats, despite their political base, to court big donors. During the 1980s, California Democrat Tony Coelho, serving as the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and then as majority whip, made a strong appeal to savings and loans executives before the crash of the industry to catch up to Republicans who had been outflanking them in raising money. The Democrats were, and have continued to, losing their traditional base of campaign support \u2013organized labor \u2013 which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s, providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns. Without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing, many Democrats concluded they needed business by their side. Democrats running for president have made the same kind of choices. In 2008, Obama disappointed many supporters upon becoming the first president to abandon the post-Watergate public finance system for campaigns altogether, preferring to raise money himself for the general campaign. While small donors were enormously important to his victories, so too were business and Wall Street executives. At the height of the financial crash, when public sentiment had clearly turned against Wall Street, the administration agreed to a financial regulation bill (Dodd-Frank) that was structured in such a way as to give powerful interests more than enough opportunity to limit the bite over the coming years. Wall Street, with an army of counsel, succeeded in eroding the impact of the legislation. Not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices Democrats can make, but it also greatly damages the party\u2019s brand name. As The Washington Post reported, the scandal that might bring down New Jersey Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez is the first involving large scale super PAC donations. At the heart of the story is almost $600,000 that physician Salomon Melgen gave to Senate Majority PAC, possibly in exchange for favors. This is not simply some sort of accommodation of Democrats to the corporate system. They don\u2019t have much of a choice. Without these funds, they won\u2019t be able to compete. In this election cycle, independent campaign donors are causing a huge stir. In conservative circles, the Koch brothers and their allies are throwing around enormous amounts of money to candidates who will support their deregulatory agenda. Individual donors such as Las Vegas gambling magnate Sheldon Adelson are causing ripples every time candidates speak, pressuring them to adjust their agenda. Democrats have found their own magnates for political support, such as Tom Steyer and George Soros. This is why campaign finance reform is so important, Without Congress changing the fundamental dynamics, there won\u2019t be much room for populism to thrive. Even if Democrats select someone like a Elizabeth Warren as their candidate or Hillary Clinton decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy, there won\u2019t be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts. The Democratic Party needs Wall Street more than it needs to take a stand against Wall Street. Those are the facts on the ground. The Democratic Party needs Wall Street more than it needs to take a stand against Wall Street. Julian Zelizer If Democrats really want to take on Wall Street and tackle economic inequality, they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system. If campaigns were publicly funded or there were more stringent limits on independent expenditures, Wall Street would have much more trouble achieving disproportionate influence. Reform could level the playing field. More often than not, campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support. A more populist economic agenda that revolved around progressive taxation and substantial public assistance to strengthen the middle class can only work in a different kind of political system. If things stay the same, Democrats can only continue to win elections by turning to their corporate and financial base of support. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine.

Firefighters killed: Three firefighters died battling blazes in north-central Washington state Wednesday, when they were overcome by flames after they had a vehicle accident. Four other firefighters were injured. Gov.

            "article_content": "NEW: Debate ends after candidate riffs on domestic issues, terrorism Bernie Sanders apologizes to Clinton over data access by his staff Sanders campaign irked that the Democratic National Committee slated debate for a Saturday night Bernie Sanders apologized for his aides\u2019 breach of Hillary Clinton\u2019s proprietary voter data in the opening moments of Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate \u2013 and Clinton dropped the issue. The two Democratic presidential hopefuls opted not to air out what has become a messy fight between their campaigns in front of the cameras as they met along with Martin O\u2019Malley in Manchester, New Hampshire, for their third debate of the 2016 race. Instead, Sanders opened the two-and-a-half hour debate by looking at Clinton and saying: \u201cYes. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d His comment provided a memorable start to a debate that also saw Sanders, Clinton and O\u2019Malley trade blows on taxes, health care and guns \u2013 while agreeing on their distaste for Donald Trump, the GOP front-runner. It seemed unlikely to alter the contour of the Democratic race six weeks before voting begins, while Clinton gave signs that she is already focused on the general election despite trailing Sanders in the state where the debate was held. Sanders was apologizing after at least one campaign aide seized on a glitch in the Democratic National Committee-housed master voter list revealing Clinton campaign data usually protected by a firewall from opponents\u2019 eyes. \u201cThis is not the type of campaign that we run, and if I find anybody else involved in this, they will also be fired,\u201d the Vermont senator said in response to Saturday evening\u2019s first question from ABC. Clinton thanked Sanders for the apology. \u201cNow that, I think, you know, we\u2019ve resolved your data, we\u2019ve agreed on an independent inquiry, we should move on, because I don\u2019t think the American people are all that interested in this,\u201d the former secretary of state said. Despite the public Kumbaya, there have been clear signs that the Sanders campaign sees the fight with the DNC \u2013 which it\u2019s treating as a proxy for the broader Democratic establishment \u2013 as advantageous. READ: Bernie Sanders and the DNC: It\u2019s War His campaign has highlighted the DNC\u2019s move in fundraising notes to supporters, with strategist Tad Devine tweeted a comparison of the data-breach \u201cmistake\u201d to Clinton saying years ago that her vote to go to war in Iraq in 2003 was a mistake. In person, Sanders couldn\u2019t resist letting a little resentment show, complaining that there had been \u201cmany press releases from the Clinton campaign of late\u201d focused on the issue. And Clinton, in what could have been a veiled message to early state Democratic activists, focused her closing statement on her ties to the party, playing the role of uniter against the GOP field while also providing a subtle reminder that Sanders has identified as an independent in Vermont. She also played up the contrast with Republicans as she argued that the GOP would roll back hard-won gains on voting rights and gay rights and would defund Planned Parenthood. \u201cThis is a watershed election. I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House,\u201d Clinton said. Clinton felt good enough about her debate performance to end the night with a mic-drop moment \u2013 winking at the new \u201cStar Wars\u201d movie. \u201cThank you, good night, and may the force be with you,\u201d she said. Still, at least two Clinton comments \u2013 her dismissal of rising health care premium costs under the Affordable Care Act as \u201cglitches\u201d and her claim that \u201cfinally we are where we need to be\u201d in the fight against ISIS \u2013 will be clipped and saved by Republicans for a general election. And she took some positions that could make progressives uneasy \u2013 the former secretary of state broke new ground by pledging not to support any tax hikes on the middle class as she assailed Sanders\u2019 proposal to foot the bill for a paid family leave program that both candidates support. Clinton criticized Sanders for backing a proposal to impose a 0.2% payroll tax \u2013 deducted from checks much like Social Security and Medicare \u2013 to cover his plan and said she\u2019d never support higher taxes on all wage-earners to fund such a program. \u201cThat is off the table as far as I am concerned,\u201d Clinton said, promising not to raise taxes on the middle class. \u201cThat is a pledge that I am making.\u201d Instead, she said that she\u2019d cover the cost of paid family leave with higher taxes on the wealthy. Democratic debate in New Hampshire Sanders, though, responded that his plan is backed broadly by Senate Democrats. And he said Clinton\u2019s criticism of payroll taxes is out of step with Democratic giants such as Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, who oversaw the creation of Social Security, and Lyndon B. Johnson, who shepherded Medicare into law. \u201cWhat the legislation is is $1.61 a week. Now you can say that\u2019s a tax on the middle class. It will provide three months of paid family and medical leave,\u201d Sanders said, arguing it was well worth it. The two also disagreed over health care, with Sanders arguing that his Medicare-for-all vision of ending private insurance would save Americans money, while Clinton warned that it would leave more power in the hands of Republican governors. Sanders landed his biggest blow against Clinton when he assailed her support for ousting Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi and her push for a political end to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s tenure. \u201cI worry too much that Secretary Clinton is too much into regime change and a little bit too aggressive without knowing what the unintended consequences might be,\u201d Sanders said. Clinton shot back that Sanders had supported a congressional resolution calling for Gadhafi\u2019s removal in Libya. She also warned against any policy that would allow Iran to increase its role in Syria, equating such a move to \u201casking the arsonist to come and pour more gas on the fire.\u201d But Sanders stated, \u201cWe have got to get our foreign policy and our priorities right. It is not Assad who is attacking the United States \u2013 it is ISIS.\u201d READ: Sanders touts union, liberal endorsements The candidates once again struck different tones on gun rights \u2013 with Clinton saying more citizens purchasing firearms wouldn\u2019t help matters and Sanders focusing on a search for \u201cconsensus\u201d on gun regulations. \u201cGuns in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans safer. We lose 33,000 a year already to gun violence. Arming more people \u2013 to do what? \u2013 is not the appropriate response to terrorism,\u201d Clinton said. Sanders, though, pointed to his state \u2013 Vermont \u2013 and said more than half of its residents own guns. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say that everybody\u2019s in agreement \u2013 it\u2019s a divided country on guns. But there is a broad consensus on gun safety regulation,\u201d Sanders said, calling for background checks for potential gun owners and the closure of loopholes that allow easier purchases at gun shows. O\u2019Malley, for his part, took a big swing at both candidates and charged that \u201cSecretary Clinton changes her position on this every election year, it seems.\u201d He continued, \u201cWhat we need on this issue is not more polls. We need more principle.\u201d The other candidates hit back \u2013 with Sanders interjecting, \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa.\u201d \u201cWe can do all the great speeches we want, but you ain\u2019t gonna succeed\u201d without broad-based support, Sanders said. But one topic brought all three candidates together: They really don\u2019t like Donald Trump. \u201cHe is becoming ISIS\u2019 best recruiter,\u201d Clinton said, pointing to the billionaire businessman\u2019s proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. \u201cThey are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists,\u201d she continued, though her contention hasn\u2019t been backed up. O\u2019Malley hit Trump on the same topic, saying that the United States \u201cmust never surrender our American values to racists, must never surrender them to the fascist pleas of billionaires with big mouths.\u201d And Sanders, sticking to his income-inequality message, said to attendees of Trump rallies: \u201cHe thinks low wages are a good idea.\u201d The debate also had its lighter moments, like when ABC moderator David Muir asked: \u201cShould corporate America love Hillary Clinton?\u201d \u201cEverybody should,\u201d Clinton responded. Sanders took a different tone when asked the same question. \u201cNo, I think they won\u2019t,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cWall Street will like me even less.\u201d And at one point, Clinton was moments late in returning to the stage after a commercial break, leading the crowd to interrupt a question Muir had started to ask Sanders by cheering her tardy arrival. \u201cSorry,\u201d Clinton said.

Christina Aguilera headlined a fundraiser for her. America Ferrera has vocally backed her. But despite the hip celebrity love, Hillary Clinton is having trouble with the kids. The 68-year old former secretary of state has Democratic establishment backing, key union endorsements and strong support from seniors, yet has thus far been unable to crack the code with millennials and GenXers. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Bernie Sanders, her 74-year old primary opponent, is winning nearly 60% of voters under 45 years old. Sanders is beating Clinton 41%-35% among Democratic millennials, according to The Harvard Institute of Politics\u2019 annual survey of millennials, released last week. And among all age groups, she\u2019s running neck-and-neck in some head-to-head polls against the pair of 44-year-old GOP senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. It\u2019s a sticking point for the otherwise dominant Democrat. In 2008, Clinton\u2019s campaign lost the youth vote to then-Sen. Barack Obama and eventually lost the Democratic nomination. While she is on far more stable footing this time around, the concern among some Democrats supporting Clinton is that the deficit with young voters may be more emblematic of a wider enthusiasm problem that could hurt her in the general election. READ: Hillary Clinton racks up rapper endorsements So the campaign behind one of the most experienced and well-known politicians is working on millennials with renewed gusto. She joined Snapchat, launched her account with a lighthearted selfie about \u201cchillin in Cedar Rapids\u201d and snapped about Planned Parenthood. She has participated in interviews aimed at young people, like when she chatted with BuzzFeed\u2019s Another Round podcast. And the campaign has worked with internet \u201cinfluencers\u201d like Karen Civil. Aguilera hosted a fundraiser for Clinton earlier this year, Ferrera has helped headline events for Clinton and Dunham, the star of HBO\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d will campaign for the former secretary of state\u2019s presidential bid in Iowa in January. Clinton also taped an appearance on the Comedy Central show \u201cBroad City\u201d to air next year. And Chelsea Clinton \u2013 seen as an asset with younger voters and students \u2013 will become a more prominent voice in the campaign as well. The former first daughter headlined a fundraiser with her mother Thursday in New York, will headline two more in Boston in January and plans to start traveling to early nominating states like Iowa and New Hampshire early in 2016. Read: Chelsea Clinton to step up role in her mother\u2019s campaign Clinton aides are still confident that despite the polling that shows their boss trailing with young voters, she will be able to win them over by speaking directly to issues that they care about, namely college affordability, social issues and women\u2019s rights. They also feel targeted rollouts like the one she made on campus sexual assaults in Iowa earlier this year will help. The gender card is key because it gets at something young voters love: her potential to become the first woman president, said Monmouth University Poll director Patrick Murray. \u201cOne of the things she should probably hit on more is the historic nature of her candidacy,\u201d Murray said. The disparity can be seen at the campaign\u2019s respective rallies. Sanders\u2019 supporters, particularly in Iowa and New Hampshire, are generally younger, often with more unruly hair, thick plastic hipster glasses and the occasional waft of patchouli. And Clinton\u2019s supporters generally appear a little older and a little more kempt. Nancy Sweetman, a longtime Clinton supporter, first saw Sanders speak at Iowa\u2019s Wing Ding dinner in August. After only a few minutes at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Sweetman said she noticed how much older Clinton supporters were. \u201cIn my lifetime I would like to see a woman that I agree with in the White House,\u201d said the 71-year old retiree who said she remembers a time when the thought of a woman president was laughable. \u201cThat is a part of it.\u201d Even amid the Clinton campaign\u2019s focus on young voters, Sanders, the oldest candidate seeking the White House, has held onto a strong lead among young voters \u2013 a seeming anomaly that makes even a few Sanders aides chuckle. A Des Moines Register poll last week found that Clinton has the support of 64% of Iowa Democrats 65 and older, while Sanders has the support of 58% of people younger than 45. A Fox News poll found similar results in New Hampshire: Sanders wins 59% of people under 45, while Clinton wins 52% of people over than 45. Lynda Tran, a partner at 270 Strategies and a former spokeswoman for President Barack Obama\u2019s separate campaign arm \u2013Organizing for America \u2013 said that for Clinton, the best strategy is probably staying the course she\u2019s already charted, Tran said. \u201cThe Clinton campaign team in particular has already demonstrated real savvy in their approach, with concerted efforts on everything from Snapchat to Periscope, from college organizing teams to interviews with thought leaders and perceived trendsetters like Lena Dunham,\u201d she said. READ: Rapper drops Clinton for Sanders But young voters are still less politically engaged than their older counterparts who are far more likely to not only vote in November, but show up at caucus night in Iowa. In 2004, voters 17-to-29 made up 17% of the Iowa Democrats who caucused that year, a dismal turnout of 4%. Even in 2008, where young participation was at an all-time high in Iowa thanks to Obama, only 22% of the electorate was 17-to-29 years old, the same portion of the voters that were 65-and-older. And the Harvard survey reported that only 20% of millennials said they were engaged and fewer than half of the respondents said they were following the 2016 campaign. That, however, won\u2019t stopped Clinton from trying. Clinton used Snapchat to knock Republicans while acknowledging that she is aware the latest Star Wars movie was coming out at midnight. \u201cThis year,\u201d read Clinton\u2019s Snapchat account, \u201cRepublicans reminded us that the Dark Side is alive and well.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Texas senator held a \"Rally for Religious Liberty\" at Bob Jones University Cruz courts evangelicals in South Carolina, a key group if he's to win the nomination Ted Cruz used the backdrop of the terror attacks in Paris as the latest evidence that Christians are under siege, making a pitch on Saturday to evangelicals here that tied together his take-no-prisoners foreign policy with his faith-driven domestic agenda. The Texas Republican, kicking off his most extensive trip yet in South Carolina, had planned for a month a large, highly-produced \u201cRally for Religious Liberty\u201d that mirrored a similar event this summer in Iowa. But Friday\u2019s attacks in France recalibrated Cruz\u2019s message and its overall tone: He began the event with a lengthy moment of silence, and Cruz spent nearly as much time discussing the perils of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d as he did government persecution of Christian merchants and educators. \u201cRight now as we speak, it is persecuting Christians. It is persecuting Jews. It\u2019s even persecuting fellow Muslims,\u201d Cruz said of Islamic extremists, as part of a prayer at Bob Jones University, a prominent Christian school. \u201cWe ask for unity for the people of America, and we ask finally, that you bless this gathering in celebration of the liberty to worship you with all of our hearts, minds and souls.\u201d RELATED: Santorum: \u2018People are dying because this president refuses to face the truth\u2019 Cruz\u2019s path to the nomination depends largely on winning born-again Christians, particularly in states like Iowa and South Carolina. His campaign has worked to win over some of the evangelical movement\u2019s leading lights and to recruit local pastors to endorse him in each county in that pair of early-voting states. And if he is the nominee, Cruz told voters here that all he needed to win a general election was 10 million more Christians to vote for him than did in 2012 \u2013 a number the presidential candidate portrayed as doable. The campaign said about 2,500 people came to watch the series of videos and on-stage interviews, in which Cruz himself was featured very little. But the event Cruz convened had the feel of a high-tech service at a megachurch, with sharply cut videos between sermons from movement leaders like Tony Perkins and testimonials from ordinary people who said they weren\u2019t allowed to pray or share their beliefs in public. After chastising the media on Friday for \u201cbelittling\u201d these stories of religious persecution and at one point taunting television cameras to air videos critical of Planned Parenthood, Cruz told reporters before the rally on Saturday that his argument didn\u2019t just apply to Christians, though he said they were the ones most ostracized today and that they needed constitutional protections. \u201cIt protects Christians, it protects Jews, it protects Muslims, it protects anyone who is engaged in peaceful exercise of their faith,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cThat being said, though, the Obama administration has demonstrated a particular antipathy for Christians.\u201d RELATED: Trump says Paris attacks \u2018much different\u2019 if residents had guns",

            "article_content": "GOP candidates skewered the CNBC moderators RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said CNBC 'should be ashamed' Republican presidential candidates tore into CNBC\u2019s moderators at Wednesday night\u2019s GOP debate, issuing the sharpest attacks on the mainstream media of the 2016 election cycle. Sen. Ted Cruz accused the moderators of trying to instigate a cage match, Sen. Marco Rubio called the media a super PAC for Hillary Clinton, and Donald Trump slammed the \u201cridiculous questions.\u201d The candidates took to the airwaves again early Thursday morning and continued to rip CNBC for the tone and substance of the debate. And in the days ahead, sources said, campaign representatives will air their grievances to the Republican National Committee. Ben Carson even told reporters Thursday that he would be demanding a new debate format. \u200e\u201dWe need a change of format,\u201d Carson said during a press conference in Lakewood, Colorado. \u201cDebates are supposed to be to \u2018get to know the candidates,\u2019 what is behind them. What it has turned into is a gotcha.\u201d \u200e Carson declined to specify what changes he would ask for, but said his campaign was reaching out to the other GOP candidates to \u201clay out a plan\u201d going forward. The next Republican debate is on November 10, hosted by Fox Business. The campaigns will find a sympathetic ear in RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, who blasted CNBC late Wednesday night for asking \u201cgotcha\u201d questions and said the network \u201cshould be ashamed.\u201d \u201cI was very disappointed in the moderators. I\u2019m disappointed in CNBC,\u201d he told reporters in the spin room in Boulder, Colorado. \u201cI thought they would bring forward a pretty fair forum here tonight. But I think it was one gotcha question, one personal low blow after another.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s like they tried to design a Rubik\u2019s cube for every question to take the worst element, I think, of what the moderators and what the media should bring to the table. And all I can tell you is that while I\u2019m pretty much proud of our candidates for pretty much sticking together, I\u2019m very disappointed in the moderators and I\u2019m very disappointed with CNBC.\u201d Priebus went even further in an official statement: \u201cOne of the great things about our party is that we are able to have a dynamic exchange about which solutions will secure a prosperous future, and I will fight to ensure future debates allow for a more robust exchange,\u201d he wrote. \u201cCNBC should be ashamed of how this debate was handled.\u201d The candidates\u2019 attacks on the media were red meat for the conservative base, which already has a deep mistrust of the mainstream press. But even by conservative standards, the candidates\u2019 broadsides on Wednesday night were aggressive and unrelenting, and delighted the audience in Boulder. The candidates\u2019 fierce criticism of CNBC \u2013 the first sustained volley against the media of the current campaign \u2013 immediately called to mind the frequent attacks against the press during debates in the 2012 elections. Brian Steel, CNBC\u2019s senior vice president for public relations, stood by the moderators\u2019 performance. \u201cPeople who want to be President of the United States should be able to answer tough questions,\u201d he said in a statement late Wednesday night. RELATED: Rubio, Bush brawl at the debate Yet the morning after the debate on Thursday, GOP candidates continued to criticize CNBC and the mainstream media generally. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on \u201cNew Day,\u201d Rubio took issue with the tone and substance of the debate and said he hoped future debates would do a better job of focusing on important issues. Carly Fiorina, appearing on \u201cNew Day\u201d with Alisyn Camertoa, chided the \u201cliberal media\u201d and The Washington Post specifically for continuing to focus on her remarks about Planned Parenthood. Later in the show, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie told Camerota that he was going to keep standing up to debate moderators. \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow them to ask stupid questions,\u201d he said. The campaigns will further address their frustrations in a conference call with the RNC in the days ahead, campaign sources said. Their goal is to ensure that the Fox Business debate on November 10 focuses on more substantive issues, skips the \u201cgotcha\u201d questions, and provides all candidates with more equal speaking times. On Wednesday night, CNBC\u2019s moderators struggled to maintain control of a debate that, according to many journalists on Twitter, they appeared ill-equipped to handle. The panelists, usually familiar with covering Wall Street and finance, were left scrambling to talk about a presidential race they seemed to know little about. At one point during the debate, Jeb Bush campaign manager Danny Diaz began pounding on the control room door, shouting at the CNBC producers about how the network wasn\u2019t giving equal time to all the candidates, a source with a rival campaign told CNN. The night left GOP hopefuls and reporters wishing for the previous Republican debate moderators from Fox News and CNN. Politico\u2019s John Bresnahan joked that CNBC was frantically calling CNN and Fox \u201cto ask how to run a debate,\u201d while Matthew Continetti, the editor of the conservative Washington Free Beacon, wrote: \u201cWinners of GOP Debate so far: Jake Tapper and Anderson Cooper.\u201d On stage, Cruz was the night\u2019s most vocal media critic, condemning CNBC for trying to instigate fights between the candidates while ignoring issues that mattered to voters. \u201cThe questions that have been asked so far in this debate illustrate why the American people don\u2019t trust the media,\u201d Cruz said, after being asked about the debt ceiling. \u201cThis is not a cage match.\u201d \u201cHow about talking about the substantive issues people care about,\u201d Cruz added to thunderous applause from the audience. The audience in Boulder was electrified by Cruz\u2019s attack. Social media mentions of Cruz blew up during his attack on the media \u2013 it was the top moment on Facebook, the social network said \u2013 while pollster Frank Luntz said his focus group \u201cburst out in applause at Ted Cruz\u2019s media attack.\u201d \u201cTed Cruz\u2019s focus group dials [hit] 98 with his attack on media bias,\u201d Luntz wrote on Twitter. \u201cThat\u2019s the highest score we\u2019ve ever measured. EVER.\u201d The Texas Senator wasn\u2019t the only one to slam the mainstream media at the debate: Rubio, asked to respond to a Florida Sun Sentinel editorial that had called on him to drop out of the race, charged that it \u201cevidence of the bias that exists in the American media.\u201d Later in the debate, Rubio declared that the mainstream media was so biased in favor of Clinton that it was effectively functioning as her Super PAC. Trump, who had predicted before the start that the debate would be \u201cunfair,\u201d criticized CNBC\u2019s moderators for asking \u201cridiculous questions,\u201d and later called a question posed to Mike Huckabee \u201cnasty.\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie looked one moderator in the eye and said, \u201cEven in New Jersey what you\u2019re doing is called rude.\u201d At various points in the debate, both Rubio and Trump accused the moderators of having their facts wrong. CNBC\u2019s problems were further compounded by the network\u2019s meandering commentary between the night\u2019s two debates, which was widely panned on Twitter. \u201cCNBC does underscore that the only people sometimes more vapid than candidates are journalists talking about candidates,\u201d New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof tweeted, echoing the sentiments of many journalists and political operatives. \u201cIs this a public access channel?\u201d asked Jon Favreau, the former speechwriter for President Barack Obama. CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston and Sunlen Serfaty in Boulder, Colorado, contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Carly Fiorina reached 15% in the GOP primary polls after the September CNN debate, but has since fallen to 4% She showed ability to take on Donald Trump directly Fiorina hasn't run radio or TV ads, but raised nearly $7 million in the third quarter Carly Fiorina has to prove this week that she can become more than the star of the Republican debate team. Fiorina rocketed from a little-known, first-time presidential candidate to one of the Republican Party\u2019s top-tier contenders thanks to well-reviewed debate performances in August and September. But she has virtually vanished since. Carly Fiorina\u2019s fall Wednesday\u2019s debate will give Fiorina another chance to make a good impression and generate some positive headlines. In more ways than one, Fiorina is a candidate built for the debate stage. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO has a commanding stage presence. She is quick on her feet and rarely frazzled by criticism from her rivals. As a Silicon Valley executive, Fiorina was known for her mastery of the media and her penchant for flashy, stage-managed speeches. READ: What to watch in Wednesday\u2019s debateFiorina also proved last month that she is well equipped to take on Donald Trump, the current front-runner. In one of the most memorable exchanges of the three-hour CNN debate, Fiorina offered a stinging response to Trump\u2019s widely panned remarks mocking her physical appearance. \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,\u201d Fiorina said, as Trump appeared visibly uncomfortable. Jessica Proud, a Republican strategist who has advised a super PAC supporting Fiorina, called the exchange with Trump a standout moment. \u201cThe way she handled his attack on her appearance was really sharp and very effective and caused a lot of people to take notice,\u201d Proud said. \u201cThat was part of the bump that you saw \u2013 everyone was talking about that line the next day.\u201d Though she has cast herself as an anti-Washington candidate, an advantage thus far in this election, Fiorina has not attracted the constant media attention enjoyed by two \u201coutsider\u201d rivals leading in the polls: Trump and Ben Carson. Related: 2016 Presidential Candidates Fast Facts Trump and Carson, political novices, have drawn interest with surprising and divisive off-the-cuff comments. Fiorina is a more disciplined and polished campaigner. She\u2019s the only one of the so-called outsider candidates with experience on the stump; she ran unsuccessfully for the Senate in 2010. Fiorina has also yet to run television and radio ads, and is seen as conserving her resources for a moment closer to when voting starts. Her campaign is in a solid financial position: It raised $6.8 million in the third quarter of the year, outpacing a better-known candidate like Marco Rubio. Republican leaders say she has time to take her campaign to the next level. \u201cShe may not be in the middle of another surge but another surge may very well be right around the corner,\u201d said Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann. \u201cWho knows what effect the debate will have?\u201d Fiorina polled at 15% just after the September debate, in which she passionately took on Trump, Hillary Clinton and Planned Parenthood. Now, she\u2019s at 4%, according to last week\u2019s CNN/ORC national survey. Related: Poll: Ben Carson leads Donald Trump by double digits in Iowa Fiorina\u2019s campaign and allies have downplayed her fall in the national polls, saying she still needs time to introduce herself to voters. Unlike some rivals \u2013 Trump or Jeb Bush, for example \u2013 Fiorina is still not a household name. Her campaign says she is focused on communicating her biography and core message to voters, and predicts she will make slow but steady progress. Sarah Isgur Flores, Fiorina\u2019s deputy campaign manager, said the campaign was \u201cvery pleased\u201d with Fiorina\u2019s level of support in the early primary states, including Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. \u201cThose are people who are seeing her more than just in that one debate,\u201d Isgur Flores said. \u201cI\u2019m glad people liked her debate performance and liked her message, but one debate does not win the thing.\u201d Despite never having served in office, Fiorina spoke with confidence in the first two debates about a range of issues, including foreign policy. Memorable quotes from the #CNNDebate But she also stirred up fresh controversy in the last CNN debate with fiery criticism of Planned Parenthood. As she slammed the women\u2019s health group \u2014 which has recently been linked to videos that appear to show its officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue \u2014 Fiorina described alleged video footage in especially graphic terms. \u201cI dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes,\u201d Fiorina charged. \u201cWatch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\u201d Critics pounced, accusing Fiorina of making misleading characterizations about the group and video. Read: Fiorina hits Clinton on economics ahead of debate Despite controversy that followed, Fiorina\u2019s debating savvy thrust her into the spotlight. And those skills make for a particularly potent asset next to the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton. The former presidential candidate endured dozens of debates during the 2008 campaign and proved on the debate stage this month just how valuable those practice rounds were. Fiorina, who vowed at the launch of her long-shot White House bid to take Clinton head-on, delights in contrasting herself with the former secretary of state. Iowa State Sen. David Johnson, who is supporting Fiorina, said Clinton attacks make for some of Fiorina\u2019s most successful zingers on the trail. \u201cThe first real burst of applause was when she said I know you all are looking forward to me debating Hillary Clinton,\u201d Johnson said about a recent Fiorina campaign event in Spencer, Iowa. \u201cAnd the place just roared.\u201d",

            "article_content": "More than 40 Democratic candidates hoping to take back Republican-held seats are swarming the capital this week for a full schedule of strategy meetings as Democrats plot a path to retake the House in 2016 amid Republican infighting on Capitol Hill. The Democratic candidates for Congress and two potential recruits will meet with fundraisers, pollsters, strategists and party leaders in Washington beginning Wednesday, a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee aide told CNN. The candidates are running in 36 congressional districts where they hope to either unseat the Republican incumbent or win a seat being vacated by a Republican. Their visit comes as House Republicans continue to struggle to coalesce around a successor to replace outgoing House Speaker John Boehner. The goal, according to the aide, is to arm the Democratic candidates with the best resources and information available to run the smartest, most effective races possible. Democrats are seizing on dysfunction in the House Republican ranks, especially as a disjointed Republican caucus threatens timely action on critical pieces of upcoming legislation that if unaddressed could result in a government shutdown or cause the U.S. to default on its debt obligations. \u201cDemocrats are united and rallying together this week, so that our candidates have the tools necessary to run high energy, effective campaigns, and are ready to hold Republicans accountable in 2016,\u201d DCCC Chairman Ben Ray Lujan said in a statement to CNN. The House narrowly avoided a government shutdown amid hardline conservative efforts to hold up government funding over Planned Parenthood, funding the government with a continuing resolution through December. But before Congress again wrangles with government funding, members must first pass legislation to raise the debt ceiling before November 3 to keep the U.S. from defaulting on its debt obligations and facing a potential credit downgrade. It\u2019s not the first time Democrats have tried to seize on dysfunction in the GOP ranks. Democrats seized on the 2013 government shutdown to try to push Republicans out of office in the next year\u2019s election with little success. But House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has hinted at the \u201cprospect of a wave\u201d election in 2016 that could propel many of the Democratic candidates flocking to Washington this week into congressional offices in just over a year \u2013 and put Democrats back in control of the House for the first time since 2011. \u201cI think the Democrats could have the gavel in 18 months,\u201d Pelosi said at the Texas Tribune Festival this weekend. \u201cEven some pollsters are saying to us, \u2018I see a prospect of a wave.\u2019 Now, I think right now, today, you won\u2019t tell anybody I said this: I see us probably easily winning half the seats \u2013 maybe two-thirds \u2013 with what we have in place.\u201d The House GOP campaign arm mocked Pelosi\u2019s optimism and downplayed chances for these candidates. \u201cNancy Pelosi has once again proven to be delusional by claiming this is a wave election for Democrats,\u201d Katie Martin, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, told CNN in a written statement. \u201cWe hear this song and dance from the minority leader every cycle and frankly it\u2019s time for her to hang up her dancing shoes.\u201d The Democratic candidates will meet party leaders, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Congressional Black Caucus and the D.C. press corps.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders on the debate stage is a different ballgame than a Sanders rally Clinton was well-prepared and able to deflect criticism from the other four candidates Jim Webb and Lincoln Chafee struggled to get any message across It was a victorious comeback for Hillary Clinton, a front-runner who has been on the downswing. The former secretary of state and first lady, who once came within a few cracks of shattering the glass ceiling to win a major party\u2019s presidential nomination, stepped on to a debate stage once more Tuesday night. But this time, it was to ask the American people to allow her to succeed the very man who had crushed her White House dreams seven years ago. In the first Democratic debate of the 2016 cycle hosted by CNN and Facebook in Las Vegas, Clinton faced off against four others trying to make the same case. But it was only the rival standing to Clinton\u2019s immediate right \u2013 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose insurgent call for a political revolution has electrified the liberal base \u2014 that shared her spotlight. Here are CNN\u2019s key takeaways: Hillary Clinton hadn\u2019t set foot on a national debate stage in seven years. But far from seeming out of practice, it appeared as though she had been preparing for Tuesday night since her last failed White House bid. For more than two hours, the Democratic front-runner showed off the very skills that made her so formidable in the more than the two dozen debates she participated in ahead of the 2008 election, offering crisp, confident and fluent answers on a wide range of policy issues. Challenged on whether she is a progressive or a moderate, Clinton sought to link herself with the liberal wing Bernie Sanders represents without getting too attached to his brand of democratic socialism. \u201cI\u2019m a progressive,\u201d Clinton responded. \u201cBut I\u2019m a progressive who likes to get things done.\u201d RELATED: CNN/Facebook Democratic debate winners and losers More than anyone else on stage, it was Sanders that Clinton used most willingly to show off her dexterity. Given her first opportunity to take a jab at the Vermont senator, Clinton didn\u2019t miss a beat. The first Democratic debate \u201cNo. Not at all,\u201d Clinton responded when asked whether Sanders has been tough enough on guns. Later, when Sanders remarked that he doesn\u2019t support American troops in Syria, Clinton interrupted. \u201cWell, nobody does,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody does, Sen. Sanders.\u201d Clinton also seemed to want to tackle a major criticism that dogged her candidacy seven years ago: that she can come across as robotic and cold. She kicked off the debate by invoking her family \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a wonderful one-year-old child,\u201d she said \u2014 and ended the debate with a reference to her late mother. She also brought up her gender, noting twice that she\u2019d be the first woman President. And during a high point for the audience, she lambasted Republicans for targeting Planned Parenthood and offered a crisp defense of the embattled organization. Sanders on the debate stage is a different ballgame than a Bernie rally. Yes, he brought his style \u2013 which means he yelled, he gesticulated and he played the role of explainer. But the debate hall was more sedate than his massive rallies, and the intrusion of his opponents and the moderators placed a reality check on what Sanders prefers - a stream of conscious lecture. Sanders promised to explain Democratic socialism to America and pointed admiringly to Nordic countries for their liberalism. But while the praise of Denmark might work in New Hampshire, on the debate stage in Nevada, Clinton reminded him that this is America. On guns, he seemed unprepared for a challenge from Clinton that he should have known was coming. It\u2019s an issue where his record has been at odds with the liberals who are fueling his campaign. And Jim Webb subtly challenged him when he said that the revolution Sanders is waiting for wasn\u2019t going to happen and Congress wouldn\u2019t pay for his agenda. His best moment was when he decided enough was enough with the talk of Clinton\u2019s private email server as Secretary of State, underscoring her argument that people \u201care sick and tired of your damn e-mails.\u201d It was a moment of humor laced with Sanders trademark fire. But it was also a reminder that if he is to grow as a candidate, Sanders will need Clinton\u2019s voters. RELATED: Trump: Sanders made \u2018big mistake\u2019 on Clinton emails For the viewers who were hoping for mudslinging and finger-pointing, what they got Tuesday night was more like a session of Model U.N. Though the Democratic candidates on stage at times disagreed on politically sensitive issues including gun control, the Iraq War and Wall Street regulations, the sharp personal attacks that dominated the Republican debates were nowhere to be seen. RELATED: Hillary Clinton\u2019s big night on the debate stage Key quotes from the Democratic debate Lincoln Chafee came closest to making an allegation about personal integrity, saying to Clinton: \u201cWe need someone that has the best in ethical standards as our next president.\u201d Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous 11th Commandment was: Do not speak ill of fellow Republicans. Republicans, prodded by Donald Trump, have broken the commandment again and again in this election cycle. But at this debate, Democrats followed Reagan\u2019s rule and were nice to each other, saving their most stinging criticisms of the night for the GOP \u2014 particularly Trump. O\u2019Malley, who referred to Trump as \u201cthat carnival barker in the Republican Party,\u201d said the first Democratic fight night only helped cast the GOP in an unflattering light. \u201cIn this stage, you didn\u2019t hear anyone denigrate women, you didn\u2019t hear anyone make racist comments about new American immigrants, you didn\u2019t hear anyone speak ill of another American because of their religious beliefs,\u201d O\u2019Malley said, in apparent reference to Trump\u2019s inflammatory remarks about women and immigrants and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson\u2019s comment that he would not want a Muslim-American to serve in the White House. Clinton is to the right of her party on foreign policy \u2013 but she\u2019s faced this type of challenge before. Obama hammered Clinton constantly for her vote to go to war in Iraq during the 2008 campaign. And Chafee tried that line of attack Tuesday, suggesting that her vote disqualified her from the White House. Her response stopped the line of questioning cold. \u201cWell, I recall very well being on a debate stage, I think, about 25 times with then Senator Obama, debating this very issue,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAfter the election, he asked me to become Secretary of State. He valued my judgment, and I spent a lot of time with him.\u201d Sanders took a veiled swipe at Clinton by calling the Iraq war, \u201cthe worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country.\u201d And he said he doesn\u2019t want a repeat in Syria, where \u201cyou\u2019re talking about a quagmire in a quagmire.\u201d RELATED: 7 memorable Democratic debate moments Both Sanders and O\u2019Malley hit Clinton for advocating a no-fly zone in the midst of Syria\u2019s refugee crisis, with O\u2019Malley calling it a \u201cmilitary tool\u201d he wouldn\u2019t use. Clinton, though, advocated a stronger U.S. role in ending the civil war in Syria \u2013 and particularly in limiting Russia\u2019s influence and stopping Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201cbullying.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin that it\u2019s not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing people on behalf of Assad, and we can\u2019t do that if we don\u2019t take more of a leadership position, which is what I\u2019m advocating,\u201d she said. Clinton didn\u2019t offer a specific nation, group or leader when asked about the country\u2019s biggest foreign policy threat, instead pointing to the threat of nuclear weapons and terrorists who are seeking them. Clinton\u2019s shifting position on everything from the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal to gay marriage followed her onto the debate stage and were the subject of pointed questions by Anderson Cooper. She stuck to a familiar script Tuesday, but there\u2019s only so far that can get her. RELATED: Democratic debate: Fact-checking the candidates Clinton has come under pressure since announcing her White House bid to explain what critics have billed flip-flops, and she has consistently maintained that her views always evolved after learning more about a given issue. \u201cI\u2019ve been very consistent over the course of my entire life,\u201d Clinton answered when asked whether she was willing to say anything to get elected. On her recent about face on the Trans-Pacific Partnership\u2014 she came out against it last week after having referred to it as the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade deals as secretary state \u2014 Clinton said she had \u201choped it would be the gold standard,\u201d and only recently decided that it in fact, was not. \u201cIt was just finally negotiated last week, and in looking at it, it didn\u2019t meet my standards,\u201d she said. But it was her answer to why she took so long to oppose the Keystone pipeline that could cause headaches for the former secretary of state down the line. \u201cI never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone,\u201d Clinton said. The response is the perfect one-liner for GOP ad makers looking to make the case that Clinton has a pattern of changing her mind for political expediency. The undercards couldn\u2019t seem more out of place on the debate stage. There were moments of exceptions \u2014 particularly for Martin O\u2019Malley who gave a strong closing argument \u2014but the former Maryland governor failed to make a memorable case for his candidacy or draw distinctions with Sanders or Clinton. He had an opportunity to make an impression, and failed to take advantage. Chafee had perhaps the most cringe-worthy moment of the night. Asked about his 1999 vote to repeal Glass-Steagall, the Depression-era law that blocked commercial banks from engaging in investment banking, blamed his vote on the fact he was a rookie in office. That didn\u2019t fly, and challenged twice to justify his vote, he finally cracked. \u201cI think you\u2019re being a little rough,\u201d the former Rhode Island senator and governor said. \u201cI\u2019d just arrived at the United States Senate. I\u2019d been mayor of my city. My dad had died. I\u2019d been appointed by the governor. It was the first vote and it was 90-5, because it was a conference report.\u201d Webb used his limited time to complain that he didn\u2019t have enough time \u2013 four times he complained to moderator Anderson Cooper that he had waited 10 minutes to speak, rather than going on the offense or lay out his own vision. With a sparse campaign schedule and little rationale for his candidacy, it\u2019s hard to see him ending up in future debates as he didn\u2019t add much. Cooper, tired of Webb\u2019s complaints about speaking time, summed it up: \u201cYou agreed to these rules and you\u2019re wasting time. So if you would finish your answer, we\u2019ll move on.\u201d Opinion: We\u2019re back in 2008",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina account for about half of likely Republican voters' support Mike Huckabee sent fundraising letter following McCarthy's announcement The Republican establishment just lost the first primary of the 2016 election season. Rep. Kevin McCarthy\u2019s attempt to ascend to speaker of the House was the first real test of whether the prevailing mood of the GOP electorate \u2013 which is so disgusted with the status quo that political newcomers now lead its polls \u2013 could upend Washington\u2019s conventional wisdom that an insider always ultimately wins. Consider it upended. Hardline conservatives\u2019 agitation for an outsider left McCarthy with little hope of unifying his party \u2013 so he dropped out. It was a victory for the far right, and also a signal: The strength of the Republican insurgency is growing. RELATED: Kevin McCarthy drops out of House speaker race The potency of outsiders has been evident for months on the campaign trail, where three people who have never held political office \u2013 Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina \u2013 now account for about half of likely Republican voters\u2019 support. No votes that count have been cast in the 2016 presidential nominating process. But already, two experienced political hands \u2013 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry \u2013 have dropped out of the race. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has struggled to gain enough traction to escape the single digits in GOP polls. And Trump, the front-runner, seems to gain steam every time he insults the party\u2019s previous nominees, like John McCain and Mitt Romney. The hand-off: How Speakers Boehner to O'Neill came to power Their rise reflects in part a Republican electorate frustrated with Washington, where House and Senate GOP leaders have given up causes like defunding Planned Parenthood knowing that with Obama still in office and wielding the veto pen, they\u2019d otherwise risk blowing deadlines to fund the government and grind Congress to a halt. The outsiders\u2019 traction has been evident in polls for months. NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist surveys of the early-voting states found Trump, Carson and Fiorina at a combined 51% in Iowa and 47% in New Hampshire \u2013 figures that have remained consistent even as those three have made their own moves up and down the polls. Trump and other GOP presidential candidates rushed to claim their share of the victory. \u201cThey\u2019re giving me a lot of credit for that,\u201d Trump told a crowd Thursday afternoon in Las Vegas. \u201cI said you really need someone very, very, tough and very smart,\u201d he said \u2013 an implication that McCarthy, like retiring House Speaker John Boehner, is part of a leadership team that hasn\u2019t stood its ground against President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats. RELATED: Donald Trump takes credit for Kevin McCarthy dropping out Texas Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 who has pushed for government shutdowns before \u2013 said the House\u2019s current leaders might as well be members of a different party. Just two weeks ago, Cruz drew an enormous applause by announcing word of Boehner\u2019s resignation to the Values Voter Summit in Washington. \u201cI hope the next speaker will listen to the voters, and stop behaving like an arm of the Democratic Party,\u201d Cruz told Boston radio host Jeff Kuhner about three hours after McCarthy\u2019s announcement. RELATED: Conservatives celebrate Kevin McCarthy shocker Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee called McCarthy\u2019s defeat a victory for conservatives over the Republican lobbyist and donor classes. \u201cIt\u2019s about burning the corrupt Washington political machine to the ground and rebuilding our country so America can win again,\u201d Huckabee said in a statement. He followed up later with a fundraising solicitation, promising to burn the city down. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie took his own turn trashing Washington, saying that whether it\u2019s McCarthy or somebody else, he doesn\u2019t care, and \u201creal people\u201d don\u2019t either. \u201cIt\u2019s so dysfunctional and so ugly down there that it didn\u2019t matter to me who the speaker was,\u201d he told reporters after a campaign stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. For his part, Bush extended an olive branch to the House Freedom Caucus \u2013 which endorsed a McCarthy opponent, Florida Rep. Daniel Webster \u2013 by noting that the two are long-time friends. \u201cI just hope that they stay focused on making sure that people know they\u2019re trying to solve problems for people,\u201d Bush said.",

            "article_content": "The group of roughly 40 conservatives was a constant annoyance for Speaker John Boehner If Kevin McCarthy loses more than 29 votes on the floor, it could put him under the critical 218 votes to win the speaker's gavel No Freedom Caucus member is currently running for a leadership spot The House Freedom Caucus \u2013 a group of roughly 40 conservatives \u2013 was a constant annoyance for Speaker John Boehner. They complained Boehner was ignoring the GOP base and constantly capitulating to President Barack Obama and Hill Democrats. One of their members even kick-started the series of events that prompted Boehner to abruptly quit the speakership. Life for the next speaker won\u2019t be any easier. The conservative lawmakers have the potential to make or break the candidacy of California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy or any other would-be speaker. And they know it. Members are privately discussing a list of demands to make to McCarthy. Conservatives want slots on top committees, assurances from leaders they will get input on bills before they go to the floor, and \u200ea promise Republicans will follow through on pledges to dismantle President Barack Obama\u2019s policies. One thing the Freedom Caucus doesn\u2019t have: a candidate. So far, none of the roughly 40 conservatives in the group are running to replace Boehner \u2013 or for any other leadership position. And the group has a reputation of not always being as effective as it could be. \u201cI think most people in the Freedom Caucus realize that one of us would probably be the longest of longshots and so our hope is to work with someone who can actually win to accomplish the agenda we talked about,\u201d Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Arizona, a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, told reporters on Tuesday. Even if they don\u2019t get everything they want from McCarthy now, as a voting bloc, they have the potential to torpedo government funding bills, a measure to raise the debt ceiling, or other major must-do items this fall. If McCarthy tries to use Democratic votes to pass bills \u2013 as Boehner had to do at times \u2013 he runs the risk of facing the same uprising that felled the Ohio Republican. \u201cThe same people who were after John Boehner are going to try and fry the next guy,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, who has openly expressed frustration with the power of the conservative bloc over House leaders. Freedom Caucus member Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said the group is focused on the big picture. \u201cRight now the election is not about who\u2019s going to be the next speaker of the House,\u201d Labrador said Tuesday night. \u201cIt really should be about what we\u2019re going to do to change the process here, so everybody can feel empowered in the process, and that was the beginning of the conversation.\u201d RELATED: House GOP holds \u2018family meeting\u2019 on path forward Despite being an overwhelming favorite to win the speakership, McCarthy is not taking any votes for granted. If McCarthy loses more than 29 votes on the floor, it could put him under the critical 218 votes to win the speaker\u2019s gavel, throwing the GOP leadership race into turmoil. So immediately after Boehner announced his resignation Friday, McCarthy was on the phone with members of the group. He called up Rep. Mo Brooks on Saturday, but the Alabama Republican was watching college football so he didn\u2019t take the call. So McCarthy set up a Tuesday 30-minute sit-down in his suite just off the House floor. The wide-ranging discussion was constructive, Brooks said, but it didn\u2019t sell him on McCarthy \u2013 at least not yet. \u201cI am in a very conservative district from the state of Alabama,\u201d said Brooks. \u201cI want things done that will make the people of my district feel more comfortable about him being speaker of the House, given that his voting record, although perhaps arguably conservative in the whole political spectrum, is somewhat less-so if you look at the Republican philosophical spectrum.\u201d RELATED: Kevin McCarthy: I\u2019ll \u2018fight to win\u2019 Speaking to reporters Tuesday, McCarthy said he was different than Boehner because of his own \u201cbottom-up style\u201d of leadership. And he also added: \u201cI won\u2019t be as tan.\u201d The group was formed earlier this year after breaking off from the Republican Study Committee, another conservative caucus, because its founders wanted to take an even harder line against their party\u2019s leadership. While they have frequently been sought to undercut their party\u2019s agenda, they have often lacked a clear strategy on how to achieve their goals. Since the group was formed in early January it has been deeply divided on strategy. Rep. Mark Meadows, R-North Carolina, one of the founding members, freelanced in July when he tried to oust Boehner, but other members of the group chastised him for grabbing the spotlight without a plan to replace the Speaker ready to go. More than two months later, Boehner suddenly resigned because he did not want to force his colleagues to cast a politically toxic vote to keep him in the leadership chair. RELATED: Kevin McCarthy outlines differences between him, Boehner The group, which is secretive and does not publicize its membership, privately met for dinner Monday night at their favorite watering hole on Capitol Hill, Tortilla Coast. And they have yet to come to come to consensus on how to assert their power. The group\u2019s rules require that 80% of the members agree on their strategy before it becomes a formal caucus position. As part of the list of its demands, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, the South Carolina Republican who founded the caucus, said that he wants the GOP leadership to help elevate far-right conservatives on prime committees. \u201cThe population of the committees need to be reviewed,\u201d Mulvaney said. But Mulvaney added that McCarthy \u201chas that potential\u201d to be different than Boehner. \u201cIt\u2019s up to him to make the case to how he would do that.\u201d On Tuesday, Salmon and other leading members of the Freedom Caucus turned to one of the most popular figures among the conservative base - South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy to urge him to jump in and make a run for a leadership slot. But Gowdy told reporters late Tuesday he wouldn\u2019t run for leadership. RELATED: Gowdy: I\u2019m not running for majority leader Pressed why conservatives don\u2019t field their own candidate against McCarthy, Rep. Walter Jones, R-North Carolina, another Freedom Caucus member, blamed the current political system for being stacked against outside insurgent candidates. \u201cEverything up here is about money, everything up here is about calculating your next step,\u201d Jones said. Boehner was his party\u2019s top fundraiser and pulled in record amounts that helped elect many of the members in 2010 and 2012 who then undermined him. Most of the members in the Freedom Caucus are from solidly red districts so they don\u2019t need to worry about raising money to keep their seats. Instead they are more likely concerned about a primary challenge from the right. Many conservatives are complaining about elevating McCarthy, but they have yet to throw their support behind Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida, a conservative launching an uphill bid to oust McCarthy. Webster challenged Boehner for the top job at the start of the year as well. \u201cThis is an opportunity for our conference to elect a fresh face,\u201d Indiana GOP Rep. Marlin Stutzman told CNN. \u201cYou know people are very frustrated with John Boehner across the country and I think for us to just go from one person to the next without a very difficult process would be unhealthy for us in the long run.\u201d The first test for conservatives watching various candidates for leadership posts will come on Wednesday, when the House is expected to pass a so-called clean spending bill that funds federal agencies through December 11. Salmon predicted only about 50 House GOP members would back it because it fails to defund Planned Parenthood and told reporters Tuesday it would be \u201csuicide\u201d for any House Republican competing for a leadership job to back the bill. But McCarthy will face pressure from House moderates, too. Dent and other Republicans have also grown tired of the group\u2019s antics. Dent wants new House GOP leaders to be prepared to stand with rank and file members on the tough votes - to deal with the debt ceiling this fall and to pass a broader budget deal. \u201cWe have a responsibility to govern around here,\u201d Dent told reporters. \u201cThe worst thing in the world is to be stuck in paralysis and those same leaders will be weakened.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tal Kopan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s resignation is setting in motion an all-out scramble for the top leadership positions, and with it, a proxy fight for the future direction of the House GOP. Republican lawmakers are maneuvering to put themselves \u2013 or their allies \u2013 in line for the top two spots in particular: speaker and majority leader, since Boehner\u2019s surprise Friday announcement. Current House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy is the front-runner to move into the speaker\u2019s office. Current GOP No. 3, Rep. Steve Scalise, is making a play for McCarthy\u2019s majority leader spot, but faces a challenge from Rep. Tom Price, who is already lining up key endorsements. That leaves a race for whip \u2013 the No. 3 position \u2013 up for grabs. Here\u2019s a look at who\u2019s in who\u2019s out in the race to run the House GOP. In: Rep. Kevin McCarthy, California McCarthy, 50, is the favorite to win the spot, having moved quickly in Boehner\u2019s wake to reach out to his colleagues and shore up support among both the moderate and more conservative arms of the party. It would be a fast ascent for the California Republican: He was first elected to Congress in 2006 and after two terms, in 2011, rose to the No. 3 spot in leadership. In August 2014, after former Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor was defeated in his primary race, McCarthy moved into the majority leader spot, which has given him the inside track on replacing Boehner. McCarthy is positioning himself as a leader that can unite the party, from the conservative firebrands to the more moderate Republicans. He\u2019ll need 218 of the 247 House Republicans to assure his spot as speaker, meaning he can only lose 29 votes from his colleagues. In: Rep. Daniel Webster, Florida Webster, 66, is the only other declared candidate challenging McCarthy. The Florida Republican was elected in the 2010 wave election. He has run for speaker before \u2013 challenging Boehner in January. Though Webster came in second to Boehner, he only got 12 votes from his colleagues. (After challenging Boehner, Webster was removed from his assignment on the influential House Rules Committee.) Out: Rep. Paul Ryan, Wisconsin Despite being popular among his colleagues and a prominent Republican voice, the former GOP vice presidential candidate is skipping a run for leadership. Ryan, chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, put out a statement backing McCarthy, calling him an \u201ceffective leader.\u201d Out: Rep. Jeb Hensarling, Texas The House Financial Services Committee chairman quickly ruled out a bid for any leadership positions, putting out a statement backing Rep. Tom Price for majority leader, as well. In: Rep. Steve Scalise, Louisiana Scalise, 49, is the current House majority whip, a position he\u2019s held since 2014 after Cantor\u2019s departure resulted in McCarthy\u2019s moving up. Scalise won the three-way race by campaigning to represent conservatives. Scalise was first elected to Congress in a special election in 2008 and served as the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee before winning the No. 3 leadership spot. In: Rep. Tom Price, Georgia Price, 60, chairs the powerful House Budget Committee and has moved quickly to build support to challenge Scalise for the majority leader position. Elected in 2004, Price has earned a reputation as a fiscal conservative. He has already locked up important endorsements from Ryan and Hensarling for his bid to be majority leader, a move that edged out one of his potential challengers, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the current No. 4 in House leadership, who had been considering a run. Out: Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Washington The House Republican Conference chair, McMorris Rodgers had begun making calls to mount a bid for majority leader, a move that would have leapfrogged her into the No. 2 spot. But she never announced a run, and on Monday night said she would remain in her current leadership position amid the crowded field. Out: Rep. Pete Sessions, Texas Sessions opted to run for whip over majority leader, he told CNN on Tuesday. He first announced the move in a letter to colleagues on Tuesday, according to the Dallas Morning News. Out: Rep. Trey Gowdy, South Carolina Prominent lawmakers including Reps. Jason Chaffetz and Mia Love, had called for the firebrand Gowdy to run for Majority Leader. Gowdy has gained notoriety in the party as the chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which has been investigating former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But Gowdy says he\u2019s not running. \u201cI\u2019ve never run for any leadership position and I\u2019m not going to start now,\u201d he said Tuesday. In: Rep. Pete Sessions, Texas Sessions, 60, has been in office longer than many of the lawmakers jockeying for a spot on leadership. The Texas Republican was first elected in 1996 and is the chairman of the powerful House Rules Committee. Sessions sent a letter to colleagues making his pitch Tuesday, saying he would set the party on \u201cthe right path to fight for our conservative principles\u201d and citing his leadership of the National Republican Congressional Committee leading up the wave election in 2010, according to a copy obtained by the Dallas Morning News In: Rep. Dennis Ross, Florida Ross, 55, was first elected to the House in 2010. He announced his whip run in a statement on Monday, saying he is looking to \u201cadvance our conservative cause in a positive way by passing legislation that forces the President to either sign bills into law or explain to the American people why he vetoed them.\u201d He has been ranked among the 15 most conservative lawmakers by National Journal. In: Rep. Markwayne Mullin, Oklahoma Mullin, 38, is one of the younger candidates for leadership. He was first elected to Congress in 2012. He has been a strong advocate of defunding Planned Parenthood. In: Rep. Patrick McHenry, North Carolina McHenry, 39, was first elected to Congress in 2004. He announced he was running on Tuesday in an email to colleagues in which he called for a \u201cculture change\u201d in the party. He called for \u201ca new culture based on trust, consistency, communication, and collaboration,\u201d according to The Charlotte Observer. Wildcard: Rep. Peter Roskam, Illinois Roskam has so far shied away from running for any leadership posts, but he\u2019s maneuvered for a role in picking the next leader. He successfully pushed for the party to hold a private meeting to debate its future before holding leadership elections on Tuesday evening.

            "article_content": "John Boehner's resignation reflects outsider anger at the GOP establishment That anger could make it harder for candidates like Jeb Bush to win the Republican presidential primary As if Jeb Bush needed another problem. House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s abrupt resignation Friday \u2013 after an insurrection by grassroots activists infuriated at the failure of Washington Republicans to thwart President Barack Obama \u2013 was another bad omen for a campaign wilting amid anti-establishment fury. In the 2016 presidential race, outsiders are in, insiders are out and the messy power struggle that is splintering the GOP is going to make winning the nomination \u2013 and then capturing the White House \u2013 very tough for a party standard bearer like Bush. Donald Trump, Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina are dominating the GOP presidential primary following a summer of anger powered by conservative activists, Tea Party agitators and talk radio provocateurs. Candidates like Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, meanwhile, have been overtaken by events, with the traditional GOP path to the nomination blocked by scorched earth insurgents. John Boehner's political career Boehner\u2019s departure might be the conservative right\u2019s most famous get yet \u2013 even bigger than the coup against his former lieutenant Eric Cantor in a primary election in 2014. And the reaction to his resignation crystallized the split in the GOP with conservatives emboldened and establishment candidates sounding a softer tone that seems increasingly out of step with primary voters. \u201cYou want to know how much each of you terrify Washington?\u201d asked Sen. Ted Cruz, a GOP presidential candidate and self-styled scourge of Washington asked right-leaning activists at the Values Voter Summit in Washington on Friday. \u201cYesterday John Boehner was Speaker of the House. Y\u2019all come to town and somehow that changes. My only request is can you come more often!\u201d READ: Why John Boehner quit Conservative groups aligned with the Tea Party and the House Freedom Caucus were quick to claim that Boehner\u2019s decision showed they had defeated the more moderate elements of the party. Citizen\u2019s United President David Bosse declared that Boehner\u2019s exit was a \u201cvictory for grassroots conservatives.\u201d FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon linked the Cantor and Boehner ousters and proclaimed: \u201cthe tide is changing in Washington.\u201d He pledged the group would force the next set of House leaders to \u201cadhere to conservative principles.\u201d Trump, who is positioning himself as the ultimate outsider and galvanizing grassroots conservatives to power his anti-establishment crusade, said Boehner\u2019s announcement showed that it was time \u201cto get back to business.\u201d \u201cWe want people that are going to get it done,\u201d he said addressing Boehner\u2019s decision at the Washington summit where he arrived carrying his Bible. \u201cThey get elected. They\u2019re full of vim and vigor. They\u2019re going to change things\u2026 They come down to these magnificent vaulted ceilings that you see all over Washington. And what happens? They become different people.\u201d For his part, Bush simply took to Twitter to praise Boehner\u2019s career. \u201cJohn Boehner dedicated his life to public service. Bringing the Holy Father to Congress was a fitting cap to a great career,\u201d Bush said, referring to Pope Francis accepting an invitation from Boehner to speak before lawmakers on Thursday. It would be impossible to overestimate the strength of antipathy toward Boehner and his Senate counterpart, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, among the kind of people that show up to Trump\u2019s events in places like Alabama and Dallas. These potential voters believe that the party\u2019s leaders have ignored them and squandered victories the party was handed in the 2010 and 2014 mid-term elections that led to a GOP majority on Capitol Hill. Despite the constitutional constraints on action in Washington and the presence of a Democratic President with a veto in the White House, they are furious that the GOP has failed to overturn Obamacare. The same struggle is now playing out among grassroots activists who want to shut down the government in a bid to defund Planned Parenthood \u2013 pitting them against party leaders who believe they must show voters they can govern before the 2016 presidential race. Shortly after Boehner\u2019s announcement on Friday morning, Ken Cuccinelli, who runs the Senate Conservatives Fund, sent an email to his membership list with the title \u201cYou Did It.\u201d READ: Will Nancy Pelosi miss John Boehner? Depends. \u201cAll of your efforts have brought us to this point, and we\u2019re extremely grateful. To save this great country, we need strong Republican leaders who will stand up for our conservative principles and not back down.\u201d Former Cantor aide Doug Heye, paraphrasing late New York Yankees hero Yogi Berra who died this week, said Boehner\u2019s departure left the GOP with a dilemma. \u201cRepublicans are coming to a fork in the road \u2013 and the question is \u2013 whether or not they will take it,\u201d Heye told CNN. \u201cThere are a lot of people who wanted to fight \u2013 all we could do is fight Obama, fight the Democrats nonstop. Or do we have a strategy of not just throwing punches but landing punches?\u201d The way the GOP resolves that question could go a long way to sealing the fate of Bush and other Republican establishment candidates and answer another question hanging over the 2016 race: will the GOP nominate a candidate with broad enough appeal to win a general election? For months, the argument for Bush\u2019s candidacy has been that he would be the most electable candidate, having shown his ability to win in the mighty swing state of Florida. But for now, at least among the activists who dominate the early caucus and primary states, the premium is on desire for something fresh. A track record of compromise and the ability to work seamlessly with both sides of the aisle is increasingly looking like a blemish on the records of establishment candidates like Bush rather than an asset. In recent election cycles, even those in which outsiders, for a short time at least captured the zeitgeist, the GOP has eventually returned to establishment figures like Mitt Romney and John McCain. For Bush to win in 2016, that would have to happen again. But so far, as he lags below 10% in many national polls and struggles for traction in swing states, that is not happening. And if GOP Rep. Peter King of New York is right, it may already be too late for the establishment to prevail. King said Boehner\u2019s departure was essentially \u201cthrowing raw meat\u201d to \u201csmall but loud faction\u201d of the GOP and was bad news for the party. \u201cIt signals that crazies have taken over the party,\u201d King told CNN. \u201cThis has never happened before in our country. Where a person doing a job, the Speaker of the house, was removed from office, by a small faction because they want these unreasonable demands that if you don\u2019t agree with them you shut the government down. This is insanity.\u201d READ: John Boehner\u2019s resignation sparks succession fight One candidate left with a delicate balancing act after Boehner\u2019s demise is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, currently enjoying a polling spurt after a strong showing in the CNN GOP debate earlier this month. Rubio, a former Florida House speaker, is simultaneously angling for the establishment lane of the party \u2013 trying to elbow out his mentor Bush \u2013 while seeking to retain credibility with the right. His delicate task was summed up in his reaction to Boehner\u2019s resignation \u2013 news of which came through as he was on stage for the Values Voter Summit. \u201cI\u2019m not here to bash anyone \u2014 but the time has come to turn the page. The time has come to turn the page and allow a new generation of leadership in this country,\u201d Rubio said. At the risk of angering far-right activists, Kasich went the farthest among the presidential candidates in supporting Boehner on Friday. \u201cIt just reflects the dysfunction in Washington,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cWhere people cannot even honor somebody who has dedicated their life to public service\u2026 He built the largest Republican majority in modern time\u2026 I guess no good deed goes undone or unpunished because some of the most savage attacks on him come from Republicans.\u201d Watching the Republican infighting from the sidelines, many Democratic strategists view the increasing pressure on GOP candidates to appease the far right as a harbinger of good things to come for their party in 2016. Democratic pollster Geoff Garin, the president of Hart Research \u2013 a firm that has done recent polling for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund \u2013 said Friday\u2019s developments raised serious questions about \u201cwhether the Republican Party can survive as a coherent, functioning political entity.\u201d \u201cSince Republicans have become the majority party in the House, their brand has really been severely damaged,\u201d Garin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that people necessarily love the Democratic Party or have a very high regard for it,\u201d but Republicans, Garin said, \u201chave alienated huge swaths of the electorate, particularly millennials and important groups of women voters.\u201d Opinion: 4 rising stars who could replace Boehner Pointing to his firm\u2019s polling for Planned Parenthood Action Fund earlier this summer, Garin argued the brinksmanship over shutting down the government in a futile effort to defund Planned Parenthood has not done the Republican Party any favors. While the unrest within the GOP may continue to push the presidential candidates farther to the right, several Republican strategists cautioned that the most electable candidate often prevails. And in the long run, Boehner\u2019s departure may have little impact on the presidential race \u2014 beyond being a symbol of division within the GOP. Veteran Republican strategist Kevin Madden said Boehner may have served as an applause line for some of the candidates Friday, but that \u201cvoters aren\u2019t going to be making their decision on our next nominee through the lens of a House leadership figure.\u201d \u201cThe more important question for each candidate,\u201d he said, \u201cis whether you can persuade voters that you have the unique ability to lead the country and can be an effective commander in chief. You have to answer that on your own, no matter who the Speaker of the House is.\u201d READ: Is Mitch McConnell next?",

Things got a little pointed and hard to keep track of this week as Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton squared off, most Republicans ganged up on Clinton, she hit back at them and Trump lashed out at just about everyone. Here\u2019s a look at all of the hits this week between the candidates on Twitter: On Monday, Bush squared off with Clinton on Twitter about her new college savings plan. The fighting began after Clinton tweeted about her plan, called the New College Compact, writing, \u201cCost won\u2019t be a barrier to an education. Debt won\u2019t hold you back.\u201d Cost won't be a barrier to an education. Debt won't hold you back.

Jeb Bush, Sen. Rand Paul and Carly Fiorina. He tweeted an Instagram video that was a 15-second video mashup, edited to the tune of circus music, that features Presidents George H.W.

Neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, Sen. Ted Cruz, Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Sen. Jim Webb were the only candidates who didn\u2019t send out attacks on Twitter this week. It appears they\u2019ve avoided the Twitter attacks and instead focus their Twitter accounts on promoting their own campaign and travels on the trail. What\u2019s going to happen once they all arrive at the Iowa State Fair? We\u2019ll have to wait and see.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's campaign in Iowa is anything but politics as usual The billionaire businessman is gaining volunteers to help in the first-in-the-nation caucus state For a campaign that\u2019s made a splash in entering the GOP race, it\u2019s no surprise that Donald Trump\u2019s organization in Iowa \u2013 home of the first-in-the-nation caucus \u2013 is anything but politics as usual. In a state where the key to a caucus win is to \u201corganize, organize, organize,\u201d the Trump campaign is now tasked with the challenge of turning curious Iowans into volunteers. Critics have said that the Trump campaign lacks a strong ground game in other early voting states, such as New Hampshire and South Carolina, where the operation has been described as \u201chaphazard.\u201d But in Iowa, the Trump team believes momentum is growing as they build relationships and convert names on clipboards into full-fledged Trump evangelists who will turn out on caucus night in February. Craig Robinson, a GOP activist and founder of The Iowa Republican blog, said the campaign\u2019s ability to turn interest into actual commitment in a state where voters take their time choosing a candidate will be key to Trump\u2019s success. \u201cThe question always boils down to whether or not people are ready to make a commitment to one particular candidate. In that regard, it may be more difficult for the Trump campaign to make the final sale with activists than the more mainstream candidates. Only time will tell,\u201d he said. CNN asks Trump not to punish Iowa reporters RELATED: Trump says no government shutdown over Planned Parenthood Trump\u2019s Iowa state director, well-respected veteran campaign operative Chuck Laudner says the campaign has garnered the intensity and excitement usually reserved for the election week \u2013 still over a year away. Volunteers have been pouring in so fast that the campaign has had trouble tracking them all. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good problem to have,\u201d Laudner told CNN. \u201cPeople are locked in and excited. I\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d Despite the rapid influx of eager Iowans, Laudner said the campaign has been able to identify volunteers all the way down to the precinct level (there are 1,774 precincts in Iowa). Trump boasts 10 full-time staffers \u2013 and growing \u2013  in the Hawkeye State, led by Laudner. And now, they are bolstered by numerous volunteers who represent the Trump campaign at county fairs, parades, local Republican Party dinners and meetings, and even RAGBRAI, a week-long bicycle ride across the state attracting over 20,000 riders. By comparison, Scott Walker\u2019s campaign has five full-time staffers in Iowa. Meanwhile, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has a team of 47 full-time organizers. The Trump campaign\u2019s Iowa co-chair, Tana Goertz is a former \u2018Apprentice\u2019 contestant who says she\u2019s on a mission to make the billionaire\u2019s political organization \u201cclassy\u201d and \u201cmore professional\u201d to better reflect the Trump brand, shaking traditional tactics up. Following her reality television stint, the entrepreneur and mom of two became well-known for her Bedazzler infomercial. This is her first foray into politics, and she\u2019s surprising longtime politicos within the campaign by recruiting \u201ccaucus leaders\u201d around the state with an Apprentice-style competition. The first competition, complete with a mock-boardroom, found a \u201csuper-volunteer\u201d to represent the Trump campaign in Davis County. Goertz placed a Facebook ad for an event called \u201cSTUMP 4 TRUMP\u201d at the Davis County Fair in July. The premise was simple: whoever collected the most names, numbers, and email addresses of Trump supporters, won. Trump bars reporters from Iowa campaign event RELATED: Donald Trump to Gawker: Call me now The fact that more than 20 people showed up to compete to volunteer is unheard of in a state where most campaigns are signing up anyone who might be willing to get involved. \u201cFrom Day 1 when we started talking about what this campaign is, I said we should try different things. This isn\u2019t politics as usual. We\u2019re open to fresh ideas. I\u2019m tired of doing the same thing over and over again,\u201d Laudner said. \u201cNo matter how hard you try, you can\u2019t create that excitement. It\u2019s helping us identify who we need to be successful on caucus night.\u201d Winner Dennis Rysdam is now the face of the Trump campaign in Davis County in his role as caucus leader, managing volunteers in the Southeast Iowa county, attending party events, and coordinating yard signs and bumper sticker distribution. Goertz wants to hold competitions in all 99 counties, and she\u2019s taking her show on the road this month in the #TrumpBus, a tour bus wrapped in blue with Trump\u2019s logo and signature \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d tagline. Over the next few months, campaign staffers will ply caucus leaders and precinct chairs across the state with caucus kits, a handbook to prepare them with the basics of campaigning and engaging with voters on a hyperlocal level. \u201cIt\u2019s the most unconventional campaign I\u2019ve ever worked on,\u201d said Iowa Trump operative John Hulsizer, who has worked on presidential campaigns since 1996. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to go sell Mr. Trump. People are ecstatic to get involved.\u201d Trump\u2019s name recognition and celebrity status, paired with the fact that he doesn\u2019t need to raise money because he\u2019s \u201creally rich,\u201d have been hugely beneficial to the campaign\u2019s efforts. \u201cIt frees us up to actually talk about the real issues,\u201d Hulsizer said, adding that he\u2019s been part of a \u201cDonald Trump movement\u201d since he joined the campaign in June. The biggest challenge over the next six months, Laudner said, is being able to sustain the energy the campaign has built so early. \u201cPeople have told me this is going to be a heavy lift. But we\u2019re not just going to be standing still. We\u2019re moving forward,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is the fastest-rising star in conservative politics. He\u2019s rocketing to the top-tier of potential 2016 GOP contenders following a strong appearance in Iowa last month and surging to the front of the pack in a handful of polls. But coming off a 2012 cycle that saw Republican candidates rise and fall with the regularity of a finely-made Swiss watch, Walker\u2019s challenge now is figuring out a way to sustain the momentum. If he can seize that opportunity, then he could cement himself as one of the leading prospects for the GOP nomination, presenting himself to Republican voters as a more conservative option to establishment candidates such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. READ: Conservatives party like it\u2019s 2016 The spotlight was squarely on Walker Thursday as he addressed the annual gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington. For the two-term governor, the moment offered an opportunity to present his vision for the country and share his record in Wisconsin. He offered a blistering critique of President Barack Obama\u2019s handling of the threat of \u201cradical Islamic terrorism.\u201d But he didn\u2019t offer a specific answer to how he\u2019d take on the group, instead pivoting back to his experience in Wisconsin. \u201cIf i can take on 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the globe,\u201d he said. For Walker, his Wisconsin bona fides begin with his 2011 push to curb collective bargaining for public sector workers in Wisconsin. That move led to a fierce backlash from organized labor and progressive allies, massive protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol building in Madison, and a recall effort that Walker survived in June 2012. He became the first governor in U.S. history to accomplish that feat, and in the process endeared himself to conservatives nationwide. Now he finds himself in the middle of another confrontation with labor, this time surrounding right-to-work legislation that would bar private companies from reaching labor agreements requiring workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment. The Wisconsin state Senate approved the measure on Wednesday and the state assembly is expected to take it up next week. Walker has fully embraced the legislation, pledging to sign it and blasting out a fundraising appeal Thursday morning touting his record as a \u201cbold reformer\u201d who has \u201ctaken the reins of power away from the bosses and put the taxpayers back in charge.\u201d WATCH: Conservatives rally That position stands in contrast with Walker\u2019s approach during his 2014 re-election campaign when he said the right-to-work legislation was \u201cnot something that\u2019s part of my agenda.\u201d The scrutiny that comes from battles with organized labor is more comfortable ground for Walker when compared to his cautious responses to questions in recent weeks involving evolution, Rudy Giuliani\u2019s comments that President Obama does not love America and the president\u2019s religious beliefs. By playing it safe in those instances, Walker opened himself up to criticism that he might not be totally ready for prime time. Walker, though, turned the episode around on the media, blasting \u201cgotcha questions\u201d as distractions from the \u201cbig, bold ideas\u201d he is promoting. At CPAC, he touted those battles \u2013 as well as Republican efforts in Wisconsin \u2013  to block government dollars from going to Planned Parenthood, to require photo IDs to vote, and to reduce regulations \u2013 as he showcased the no-compromise rhetoric that has made him a conservative favorite. \u201cWe won in Wisconsin a state that hasn\u2019t gone Republican for president since 1984. \u2026 We did it without compromising,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stood up and said what we were gonna do, and then we did it.\u201d Walker continued a recent theme after his speech on Thursday, pushing back against the media when reporters asked whether he\u2019d been comparing labor protestors to terrorists when he talked foreign policy. \u201cYou all will misconstrue things the way you see fit, but I think it\u2019s pretty clear, that\u2019s the closest thing I have in terms of handling a difficult situation, not that there\u2019s any parallel between the two,\u201d he said. His anti-media rhetoric was an argument that tends to be a winner in a room full of conservative activists like he will have at CPAC. If Walker can further solidify his reputation as a fighter \u2013 not just against unions, but the media as well \u2013 that is a strategy that could allow him to remain near the front of the pack going forward. The deflections on questions about evolution and Giuliani haven\u2019t hurt his chances so far. The latest Quinnipiac University of Iowa GOP caucuses-goers this week showed Walker leading the potential field with 25 percent, nearly double his next closest competitor.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Donald Trump criticized after saying Hillary Clinton got \"schlonged\" by Barack Obama in 2008 Sally Kohn: Trump's latest comments may have reached the limit of offensiveness \u201cI think women all over this country heard very clearly what Mr. Trump said,\u201d Carly Fiorina said back in September after Donald Trump made derogatory comments about her face. It turns out to be a useful observation about Trump. When he said this week that Hillary Clinton got \u201cschlonged\u201d by Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign, women all over this country heard very clearly what he said. Trump, who rarely seems to take a defensive posture, is scurrying on Twitter trying to explain that \u201cschlonged\u201d is \u201cnot vulgar.\u201d As he has pointed out, the word has indeed been used before \u2013 albeit rarely \u2013to connote a bruising political defeat. But context matters. The remark comes on the heel of a long line of flagrantly sexist comments made by Trump. In the past, he has used words such as \u201cfat pigs,\u201d \u201cdogs\u201d and \u201cdisgusting animals\u201d to describe women. After Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pressed him about these comments at the first Republican debate, Trump later told CNN that Kelly behaved inappropriately and must have had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d Again, Trump denied he was making a derogatory comment about Kelly and menstruation. But women heard clearly what he said. And Trump has used the phrase in a political context once before \u2013 to talk about other women running for office. Trump\u2019s latest comments may have reached the limit of offensiveness. He used the word \u201cdisgusting\u201d in discussing Clinton\u2019s walk to the bathroom during Saturday night\u2019s Democratic debate. In his remark about Clinton and the 2008 election, Trump said: \u201cBut she was going to beat \u2013 she was favored to win \u2013 and she got schlonged, she lost, I mean she lost.\u201d It\u2019s almost as if he realized he had just misspoken. It\u2019s noteworthy that in the hours before Trump\u2019s remarks, Clinton was under fire for something she said.  During Saturday\u2019s debate, she asserted that ISIS would use videos of Trump\u2019s hateful anti-Muslim rhetoric to aid its agenda and recruit new terrorists. And Trump, who I\u2019m not sure has the capacity for regret, let alone contrition, demanded that Clinton apologize. Clinton may have exaggerated, but foreign policy experts agree that Trump\u2019s rhetoric plays into the goals and strategy of ISIS. But now we\u2019re all parsing Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201cschlonged,\u201d and it doesn\u2019t seem he can find a single expert to agree with him that it\u2019s not dirty and offensive. Clinton, who actually deserves an apology, is staying above the fray. The contrast makes Trump look like the schoolyard bully who comes crying when he gets a skinned knee. To be clear, while the Republican Party understandably despises Trump and the threat he poses to its electoral chances, the GOP establishment is aiding and abetting his behavior. After criticizing Trump, Jeb Bush alleged that Clinton will use the incident to play the victim. \u201cShe\u2019s great at being the victim,\u201d Bush told reporters. \u201cYou know this will enhance her \u2018victimology\u2019 status. This is what she loves doing.\u201d Can you simultaneously chastise Trump for saying something offensive while suggesting that Clinton shouldn\u2019t actually be offended but relishes being the victim?  Here too, women all over the country very clearly heard what Bush said. This rhetoric comes from a party that tried to block reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, threatened to shut down the government over funding for Planned Parenthood health clinics and refuses to acknowledge the existence of a gender wage gap, let alone support pay equity legislation. Republicans perpetually attack women\u2019s rights, and then when women say Republicans are fueling a war on women, conservatives suggest women are just crying wolf and playing the victim. The party that hopes to be elected by a majority of the American people can\u2019t even fully acknowledge how its policies and rhetoric negatively affect all the women in our country. Meanwhile, Republicans very much seem to believe the war on Christmas is real and no one accuses Santa Claus of playing the victim. Trump said something offensive. Republican policies toward women and women\u2019s health are offensive.  Accusing women who point this out of playing the victim? That\u2019s also offensive. Women all over this country hear very clearly what Republicans are saying and don\u2019t like it. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

Greg Honan, a graduate of Elon University, is his research assistant. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs. David Gergen: John Boehner may have found inner peace, but his party and America's politics are likely to be in for more disruption Could Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump wind up benefiting? After his emotion-packed encounter with Pope Francis, House Speaker John Boehner appears to be a man who has achieved an inner peace \u2013 but his resulting decision to step down could send disruptive ripples through our politics for some time to come. Watching Boehner from afar Thursday, it was clear that he was wrought up by the Pope\u2019s visit to the House of Representatives.  A devout Catholic who prays every morning, Boehner has been trying for more than two decades to bring a Pope to the institution he reveres.  Not only did Boehner finally bring the two together \u2013 a crowning moment \u2013 but as he has told many since, the Pope\u2019s personal request to Boehner to pray for him was immensely moving. At peace with himself and with his spirituality, Boehner was ready to leave the turmoil, intrigue and roiling anger he has faced from within his own party since his election as speaker five years ago.  And so he did \u2013 quickly and with characteristic grace and humility. John Boehner won\u2019t go down as one of the great speakers \u2013 he was no Sam Rayburn \u2013 but he should be remembered as one of the finest human beings there. Opinion: 4 rising stars who could replace Boehner So, what comes next?  What repercussions are we likely to see?  Here are some preliminary takes: \u2013 Perhaps Rep. Kevin McCarthy, Boehner\u2019s likely successor in the speakership, can build some early bridges across GOP factions but they are not likely to last. To lead is to choose, and eventually McCarthy will have to make decisions that will deepen the alienation of one faction or another. House Speaker John Boehner resigns \u2013 Most likely, hard-right Republicans \u2013 having pressured Boehner toward the exits \u2013 will now look for new victories in Washington and in the presidential race. Just look at the way Sens. Ted Cruz and, to a lesser extent, Marco Rubio danced on Boehner\u2019s grave. A shutdown of the federal government over Planned Parenthood in coming months is one of many scenarios one can imagine. \u2013 But this is also a moment that will give heart to Democrats.  The more Republicans seem hostage to the far right, the better chance Democrats have of keeping the White House next year and perhaps challenging control of the Senate.  Hillary Clinton will correctly see Boehner\u2019s downfall as an opening to recharge her own campaign \u2013 she can aim to be seen as a steadying force closer to the middle. \u2013 Oddly enough, Boehner\u2019s resignation could also be an opening for Donald Trump.  His candidacy plays well among Americans disgusted with Washington politics.  But instead of bringing brashness and braggadocio, Trump \u2013 if he is smart \u2013 could surprise everyone and step forward as the adult in the room, serving as the uniting force among Republicans.. Politics in America has always been a raucous affair.  Just look at accounts of infighting during Washington\u2019s presidency or reread H.L. Mencken.  But Americans also appreciate that governing is a serious business.  The visit of Pope Francis has reminded us of how serious the needs of the world are \u2013 and as he did with John Boehner, has also reminded us of the importance of seeking peace and tranquility.
